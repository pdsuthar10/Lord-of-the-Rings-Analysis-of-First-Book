 J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord Rings often erroneously called trilogy, fact single novel, consisting six books plus appendices, sometimes published three volumes. first volume, Fellowship Ring, published Great Britain London firm George Allen & Unwin 29 July 1954; American edition followed 21 October year, published Houghton Mifflin Company Boston. production first volume, Tolkien experienced became continual problem: printer’s errors compositor’s mistakes, including wellintentioned ‘corrections’ sometimes idiosyncratic usage. ‘corrections’ include altering dwarves dwarfs, elvish elfish, farther, nasturtians nasturtiums, try say try say (‘worst all’ Tolkien) elven elfin. work Lord Rings, containing invented languages delicately constructed nomenclatures, errors inconsistencies impede understanding appreciation serious readers – Tolkien many readers early on.

Tolkien also added extension prologue index – detailed index names promised first edition, but, rather, bald index names page references. Additionally, time appendices greatly revised.

J.R.R. Tolkien died 1973. third son literary executor, Christopher Tolkien, sent large number corrections misprints, mainly appendices index, Allen & Unwin use editions 1974. corrections typographical, line father’s expressed intent check copies. Since 1974, Christopher Tolkien sent additional corrections, errors discovered, British publishers Lord Rings (Allen & Unwin, later Unwin Hyman, HarperCollins), tried conscientious impossible task maintaining textual integrity whichever editions Lord Rings published. However, every time text reset publication new format (e.g. various paperback editions published England 1970s 1980s), huge numbers new misprints crept in, though times errors observed corrected later printings. Still, throughout years three-volume British hardcover edition retained highest textual integrity.

One summer’s evening astonishing piece news reached Ivy Bush Green Dragon. Giants portents borders Shire forgotten important matters: Mr. Frodo selling Bag End, indeed already sold – Sackville-Bagginses! ‘For nice bit, too,’ said some. ‘At bargain price,’ said others, ‘and that’s likely Mistress Lobelia’s buyer.’ (Otho died years before, ripe disappointed age 102.)

Sam pretended going settle permanently. decision set eastwards suggested idea him; Buckland eastern borders Shire, lived childhood going back would least seem credible. Gandalf stayed Shire two months. one evening, end June, soon Frodo’s plan finally arranged, suddenly announced going next morning. ‘Only short while, hope,’ said. ‘But going beyond southern borders get news, can. idle longer should.’ spoke lightly, seemed Frodo looked rather worried. ‘Has anything happened?’ asked. ‘Well no; heard something made anxious needs looking into. think necessary get once, shall come back immediately, least send word. meanwhile stick plan; careful ever, especially Ring.

Shire seldom seen fair summer, rich autumn: trees laden apples, honey dripping combs, corn tall full. Autumn well way Frodo began worry Gandalf again. September passing still news him.

Tell what’s trouble! Tom’s hurry now.

Chapter 7 HOUSE TOM BOMBADIL four hobbits stepped wide stone threshold, stood still, blinking. long low room, filled light lamps swinging beams roof; table dark polished wood stood many candles, tall yellow, burning brightly. chair, far side room facing outer door, sat woman. long yellow hair rippled shoulders; gown green, green young reeds, shot silver like beads dew; belt gold, shaped like chain flag-lilies set pale-blue eyes forgetme-nots. feet wide vessels green brown earthenware, white water-lilies floating, seemed enthroned midst pool. ‘Enter, good guests!’ said, spoke knew clear voice heard singing. came timid steps room, began bow low, feeling strangely surprised awkward, like folk that, knocking cottage door beg drink water, answered fair young elf-queen clad living flowers. could say anything, sprang lightly lily-bowls, ran laughing towards them; ran gown rustled softly like wind flowering borders river. ‘Comedearfolk!’shesaid,takingFrodobythehand.‘Laugh merry!

Fear nothing!FortonightyouareundertheroofofTomBombadil.’ hobbits looked wonder; looked smiled. ‘Fair lady Goldberry!’ said Frodo last, feeling heart moved joy understand. stood times stood enchanted fair elven-voices; spell laid upon different: less keen lofty delight, deeper nearer mortal heart; marvellous yet strange. ‘Fair lady Goldberry!’ said again. ‘Now joy hidden songs heard made plain me. slender willow-wand! clearer clear water! reed living pool! Fair River-daughter! spring-time summer-time, spring after! wind waterfall, leaves’ laughter!’ Suddenly stopped stammered, overcome surprise hear saying things. Goldberry laughed. ‘Welcome!’ said. ‘I heard folk Shire sweet-tongued. see Elf-friend; light eyes ring voice tells it. merry meeting! Sit now, wait Master house! long. tending tired beasts.’ hobbits sat gladly low rush-seated chairs, Goldberry busied table; eyes followed her, slender grace movement filled quiet delight. somewhere behind house came sound singing. Every caught, among many derry dol merry dol ring ding dillo repeated words: Old Tom Bombadil merry fellow; Bright blue jacket is, boots yellow. ‘Fair lady!’ said Frodo while. ‘Tell me, asking seem foolish, Tom Bombadil?’ ‘He is,’ said Goldberry, staying swift movements smiling. Frodo looked questioningly. ‘He is, seen him,’ said answer look. ‘He Master wood, water, hill.’ ‘Then strange land belongs him?’ ‘No indeed!’ answered, smile faded. ‘That would indeed burden,’ added low voice, herself. ‘The trees grasses things growing living land belong themselves. Tom Bombadil Master. one ever caught old Tom walking forest, wading water, leaping hill-tops light shadow. fear. Tom Bombadil master.’ door opened came Tom Bombadil. hat thick brown hair crowned autumn leaves. laughed, going Goldberry, took hand. ‘Here’s pretty lady!’ said, bowing hobbits. ‘Here’s Goldberry clothed silver-green flowers girdle! table laden? see yellow cream honeycomb, white bread, butter; milk, cheese, green herbs ripe berries gathered. enough us? supper ready?’ ‘It is,’ said Goldberry; ‘but guests perhaps not?’ Tom clapped hands cried: ‘Tom, Tom! guests tired, near forgotten! Come now, merry friends, Tom refresh you! shall clean grimy hands, wash weary faces; cast muddy cloaks comb tangles!’ opened door, followed short passage round sharp turn. came low room sloping roof (a penthouse, seemed, built north end house). walls clean stone, mostly covered green hanging mats yellow curtains. floor flagged, strewn fresh green rushes. four deep mattresses, piled white blankets, laid floor along one side. opposite wall long bench laden wide earthenware basins, beside stood brown ewers filled water, cold, steaming hot. soft green slippers set ready beside bed. long, washed refreshed, hobbits seated table, two side, either end sat Goldberry Master. long merry meal. Though hobbits ate, famished hobbits eat, lack. drink drinking-bowls seemed clear cold water, yet went hearts like wine set free voices. guests became suddenly aware singing merrily, easier natural talking. last Tom Goldberry rose cleared table swiftly. guests commanded sit quiet, set chairs, footstool tired feet. fire wide hearth them, burning sweet smell, built apple-wood. everything set order, lights room put out, except one lamp pair candles end chimney-shelf. Goldberry came stood them, holding candle; wished good night deep sleep. ‘Have peace now,’ said, ‘until morning! Heed nightly noises! nothing passes door window save moonlight starlight wind hill-top. Good night!’ passed room glimmer rustle. sound footsteps like stream falling gently away downhill cool stones quiet night. Tom sat beside silence, tried muster courage ask one many questions meant ask supper. Sleep gathered eyelids. last Frodo spoke: ‘Did hear calling, Master, chance brought moment?’ Tom stirred like man shaken pleasant dream. ‘Eh, what?’ said he. ‘Did hear calling? Nay, hear: busy singing. chance brought then, chance call it. plan mine, though waiting you. heard news you, learned wandering. guessed you’d come ere long water: paths lead way, Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he’s mighty singer; it’s hard little folk escape cunning mazes. Tom errand there, dared hinder.’ Tom nodded sleep taking again; went soft singing voice: errand there: gathering water-lilies, green leaves lilies white please pretty lady, last ere year’s end keep winter, flower pretty feet till snows melted. year summer’s end go find her, wide pool, deep clear, far Withywindle; open first spring linger latest. pool long ago found River-daughter, fair young Goldberry sitting rushes. Sweet singing then, heart beating! opened eyes looked sudden glint blue: proved well – shall longer go deep along forest-water, year old. shall passing Old Man Willow’s house side spring-time, till merry spring, River-daughter dances withy-path bathe water. fell silent again; Frodo could help asking one question: one desired answered. ‘Tell us, Master,’ said, ‘about Willow-man. he? never heard before.’ ‘No, don’t!’ said Merry Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright. ‘Not now! morning!’ ‘That right!’ said old man. ‘Now time resting. things ill hear world’s shadow. Sleep till morning-light, rest pillow! Heed nightly noise! Fear grey willow!’ took lamp blew out, grasping candle either hand led room. mattresses pillows soft down, blankets white wool. hardly laid deep beds drawn light covers asleep. dead night, Frodo lay dream without light. saw young moon rising; thin light loomed black wall rock, pierced dark arch like great gate. seemed Frodo lifted up, passing saw rock-wall circle hills, within plain, midst plain stood pinnacle stone, like vast tower made hands. top stood figure man. moon rose seemed hang moment head glistened white hair wind stirred it. dark plain came crying fell voices, howling many wolves. Suddenly shadow, like shape great wings, passed across moon. figure lifted arms light flashed staff wielded. mighty eagle swept bore away. voices wailed wolves yammered. noise like strong wind blowing, borne sound hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping East. ‘Black Riders!’ thought Frodo wakened, sound hoofs still echoing mind. wondered would ever courage leave safety stone walls. lay motionless, still listening; silent, last turned fell asleep wandered unremembered dream. side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; change came dreams turned groaned. Suddenly woke, thought waked, yet still heard darkness sound disturbed dream: tip-tap, squeak: noise like branches fretting wind, twig-fingers scraping wall window: creak, creak, creak. wondered willow-trees close house; suddenly dreadful feeling ordinary house all, inside willow listening horrible dry creaking voice laughing again. sat up, felt soft pillows yield hands, lay relieved. seemed hear echo words ears: ‘Fear nothing! peace morning! Heed nightly noises!’ went sleep again. sound water Merry heard falling quiet sleep: water streaming gently, spreading, spreading irresistibly round house dark shoreless pool. gurgled walls, rising slowly surely. ‘I shall drowned!’ thought. ‘It find way in, shall drown.’ felt lying soft slimy bog, springing set foot corner cold hard flagstone. remembered lay again. seemed hear remember hearing: ‘Nothing passes doors windows save moonlight starlight wind hill-top.’ little breath sweet air moved curtain. breathed deep fell asleep again. far could remember, Sam slept night deep content, logs contented. woke up, four once, morning light. Tom moving room whistling like starling. heard stir clapped hands, cried: ‘Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! hearties!’ drew back yellow curtains, hobbits saw covered windows, either end room, one looking east looking west. leapt refreshed. Frodo ran eastern window, found looking kitchen-garden grey dew. half expected see turf right walls, turf pocked hoof-prints. Actually view screened tall line beans poles; far beyond grey top hill loomed sunrise. pale morning: East, behind long clouds like lines soiled wool stained red edges, lay glimmering deeps yellow. sky spoke rain come; light broadening quickly, red flowers beans began glow wet green leaves. Pippin looked western window, pool mist. Forest hidden fog. like looking sloping cloud-roof above. fold channel mist broken many plumes billows: valley Withywindle. stream ran hill left vanished white shadows. Near hand flower-garden clipped hedge silver-netted, beyond grey shaven grass pale dew-drops. willow-tree seen. ‘Good morning, merry friends!’ cried Tom, opening eastern window wide. cool air flowed in; rainy smell. ‘Sun won’t show face much today, I’m thinking. walking wide, leaping hill-tops, since grey dawn began, nosing wind weather, wet grass underfoot, wet sky me. wakened Goldberry singing window; naught wakes hobbit-folk early morning. night little folk wake darkness, sleep light come! Ring ding dillo! Wake now, merry friends! Forget nightly noises! Ring ding dillo del! derry del, hearties! come soon you’ll find breakfast table. come late you’ll get grass rain-water!’ Needless say – Tom’s threat sounded serious – hobbits came soon, left table late beginning look rather empty. Neither Tom Goldberry there. Tom could heard house, clattering kitchen, stairs, singing outside. room looked westward mist-clouded valley, window open. Water dripped thatched eaves above. finished breakfast clouds joined unbroken roof, straight grey rain came softly steadily down. Behind deep curtain Forest completely veiled. looked window came falling gently flowing rain sky, clear voice Goldberry singing them. could hear words, seemed plain song rain-song, sweet showers dry hills, told tale river spring highlands Sea far below. hobbits listened delight; Frodo glad heart, blessed kindly weather, delayed departing. thought going heavy upon moment awoke; guessed would go day. upper wind settled West deeper wetter clouds rolled spill laden rain bare heads Downs. Nothing could seen round house falling water. Frodo stood near open door watched white chalky path turn little river milk go bubbling away valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round corner house, waving arms warding rain – indeed sprang threshold seemed quite dry, except boots. took put chimney-corner. sat largest chair called hobbits gather round him. ‘This Goldberry’s washing day,’ said, ‘and autumn-cleaning. wet hobbit-folk – let rest able! It’s good day long tales, questions answers, Tom start talking.’ told many remarkable stories, sometimes half speaking himself, sometimes looking suddenly bright blue eye deep brows. Often voice would turn song, would get chair dance about. told tales bees flowers, ways trees, strange creatures Forest, evil things good things, things friendly things unfriendly, cruel things kind things, secrets hidden brambles. listened, began understand lives Forest, apart themselves, indeed feel strangers things home. Moving constantly talk Old Man Willow, Frodo learned enough content him, indeed enough, comfortable lore. Tom’s words laid bare hearts trees thoughts, often dark strange, filled hatred things go free upon earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers usurpers. called Old Forest without reason, indeed ancient, survivor vast forgotten woods; lived yet, ageing quicker hills, fathers fathers trees, remembering times lords. countless years filled pride rooted wisdom, malice. none dangerous Great Willow: heart rotten, strength green; cunning, master winds, song thought ran woods sides river. grey thirsty spirit drew power earth spread like fine root-threads ground, invisible twig-fingers air, till dominion nearly trees Forest Hedge Downs. Suddenly Tom’s talk left woods went leaping young stream, bubbling waterfalls, pebbles worn rocks, among small flowers close grass wet crannies, wandering last Downs. heard Great Barrows, green mounds, stonerings upon hills hollows among hills. Sheep bleating flocks. Green walls white walls rose. fortresses heights. Kings little kingdoms fought together, young Sun shone like fire red metal new greedy swords. victory defeat; towers fell, fortresses burned, flames went sky. Gold piled biers dead kings queens; mounds covered them, stone doors shut; grass grew all. Sheep walked biting grass, soon hills empty again. shadow came dark places far away, bones stirred mounds. Barrow-wights walked hollow places clink rings cold fingers, gold chains wind. Stone rings grinned ground like broken teeth moonlight. hobbits shuddered. Even Shire rumour Barrow-wights Barrow-downs beyond Forest heard. tale hobbit liked listen to, even comfortable fireside far away. four suddenly remembered joy house driven minds: house Tom Bombadil nestled shoulder dreaded hills. lost thread tale shifted uneasily, looking aside one another. caught words found wandered strange regions beyond memory beyond waking thought, times world wider, seas flowed straight western Shore; still back Tom went singing ancient starlight, Elf-sires awake. suddenly stopped, saw nodded falling asleep. hobbits sat still him, enchanted; seemed if, spell words, wind gone, clouds dried up, day withdrawn, darkness come East West, sky filled light white stars. Whether morning evening one day many days passed Frodo could tell. feel either hungry tired, filled wonder. stars shone window silence heavens seemed round him. spoke last wonder sudden fear silence: ‘Who you, Master?’ asked. ‘Eh, what?’ said Tom sitting up, eyes glinting gloom. ‘Don’t know name yet? That’s answer. Tell me, you, alone, nameless? young old. Eldest, that’s am. Mark words, friends: Tom river trees; Tom remembers first raindrop first acorn. made paths Big People, saw little People arriving. Kings graves Barrow-wights. Elves passed westward, Tom already, seas bent. knew dark stars fearless – Dark Lord came Outside.’ shadow seemed pass window, hobbits glanced hastily panes. turned again, Goldberry stood door behind, framed light. held candle, shielding flame draught hand; light flowed it, like sunlight white shell. ‘The rain ended,’ said; ‘and new waters running downhill, stars. Let us laugh glad!’ ‘And let us food drink!’ cried Tom. ‘Long tales thirsty. long listening’s hungry work, morning, noon, evening!’ jumped chair, bound took candle chimney-shelf lit flame Goldberry held; danced table. Suddenly hopped door disappeared. Quickly returned, bearing large laden tray. Tom Goldberry set table; hobbits sat half wonder half laughter: fair grace Goldberry merry odd caperings Tom. Yet fashion seemed weave single dance, neither hindering other, room, round table; great speed food vessels lights set order. boards blazed candles, white yellow. Tom bowed guests. ‘Supper ready,’ said Goldberry; hobbits saw clothed silver white girdle, shoes like fishes’ mail. Tom clean blue, blue rain-washed forget-me-nots, green stockings. supper even better before. hobbits spell Tom’s words may missed one meal many, food seemed least week since eaten. sing even speak much while, paid close attention business. time hearts spirits rose high again, voices rang mirth laughter. eaten, Goldberry sang many songs them, songs began merrily hills fell softly silence; silences saw minds pools waters wider known, looking saw sky stars like jewels depths. wished good night left fireside. Tom seemed wide awake plied questions. appeared already know much families, indeed know much history doings Shire days hardly remembered among hobbits themselves. longer surprised them; made secret owed recent knowledge largely Farmer Maggot, seemed regard person importance imagined. ‘There’s earth old feet, clay fingers; wisdom bones, eyes open,’ said Tom. also clear Tom dealings Elves, seemed fashion, news reached Gildor concerning flight Frodo. Indeed much Tom know, cunning questioning, Frodo found telling Bilbo hopes fears told even Gandalf. Tom wagged head down, glint eyes heard Riders. ‘Show precious Ring!’ said suddenly midst story: Frodo, astonishment, drew chain pocket, unfastening Ring handed Tom. seemed grow larger lay moment big brown-skinned hand. suddenly put eye laughed. second hobbits vision, comical alarming, bright blue eye gleaming circle gold. Tom put Ring round end little finger held candlelight. moment hobbits noticed nothing strange this. gasped. sign Tom disappearing! Tom laughed again, spun Ring air – vanished flash. Frodo gave cry – Tom leaned forward handed back smile. Frodo looked closely, rather suspiciously (like one lent trinket juggler). Ring, looked weighed same: Ring always seemed Frodo weigh strangely heavy hand. something prompted make sure. perhaps trifle annoyed Tom seeming make light even Gandalf thought perilously important. waited opportunity, talk going again, Tom telling absurd story badgers queer ways – slipped Ring on. Merry turned towards say something gave start, checked exclamation. Frodo delighted (in way): ring right, Merry staring blankly chair, obviously could see him. got crept quietly away fireside towards outer door. ‘Hey there!’ cried Tom, glancing towards seeing look shining eyes. ‘Hey! Come Frodo, there! a-going? Old Tom Bombadil’s blind yet. Take golden ring! hand’s fair without it. Come back! Leave game sit beside me! must talk more, think morning. Tom must teach right road, keep feet wandering.’ Frodo laughed (trying feel pleased), taking Ring came sat again. Tom told reckoned Sun would shine tomorrow, would glad morning, setting would hopeful. would well start early; weather country thing even Tom could sure long, would change sometimes quicker could change jacket. ‘I weather-master,’ said he; ‘nor aught goes two legs.’ advice decided make nearly due North house, western lower slopes Downs: might hope way strike East Road day’s journey, avoid Barrows. told afraid – mind business. ‘Keep green grass. Don’t go a-meddling old stone cold Wights prying houses, unless strong folk hearts never falter!’ said once; advised pass barrows west-side, chanced stray near one. taught rhyme sing, ill-luck fall danger difficulty next day. Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! water, wood hill, reed willow, fire, sun moon, harken hear us! Come, Tom Bombadil, need near us! sung altogether him, clapped shoulder laugh, taking candles led back bedroom. Chapter 8 FOG BARROW-DOWNS night heard noises. either dreams them, could tell which, Frodo heard sweet singing running mind: song seemed come like pale light behind grey rain-curtain, growing stronger turn veil glass silver, last rolled back, far green country opened swift sunrise. vision melted waking; Tom whistling like tree-full birds; sun already slanting hill open window. Outside everything green pale gold. breakfast, ate alone, made ready say farewell, nearly heavy heart possible morning: cool, bright, clean washed autumn sky thin blue. air came fresh Northwest. quiet ponies almost frisky, sniffing moving restlessly. Tom came house waved hat danced upon doorstep, bidding hobbits get go good speed. rode along path wound away behind house, went slanting towards north end hill-brow sheltered. dismounted lead ponies last steep slope, suddenly Frodo stopped. ‘Goldberry!’ cried. ‘My fair lady, clad silver green! never said farewell her, seen since evening!’ distressed turned back; moment clear call came rippling down. hill-brow stood beckoning them: hair flying loose, caught sun shone shimmered. light like glint water dewy grass flashed feet danced. hastened last slope, stood breathless beside her. bowed, wave arm bade look round; looked hill-top lands morning. clear far-seen veiled misty stood upon knoll Forest, could seen rising pale green dark trees West. direction land rose wooded ridges, green, yellow, russet sun, beyond lay hidden valley Brandywine. South, line Withywindle, distant glint like pale glass Brandywine River made great loop lowlands flowed away knowledge hobbits. Northward beyond dwindling downs land ran away flats swellings grey green pale earth-colours, faded featureless shadowy distance. Eastward Barrow-downs rose, ridge behind ridge morning, vanished eyesight guess: guess blue remote white glimmer blending hem sky, spoke them, memory old tales, high distant mountains. took deep draught air, felt skip stout strides would bear wherever wished. seemed fainthearted go jogging aside crumpled skirts downs towards Road, leaping, lusty Tom, stepping stones hills straight towards Mountains. Goldberry spoke recalled eyes thoughts. ‘Speed now, fair guests!’ said. ‘And hold purpose! North wind left eye blessing footsteps! Make haste Sun shines!’ Frodo said: ‘Farewell, Elf-friend, merry meeting!’ Frodo found words answer. bowed low, mounted pony, followed friends jogged slowly gentle slope behind hill. Tom Bombadil’s house valley, Forest lost view. air grew warmer green walls hillside hillside, scent turf rose strong sweet breathed. Turning back, reached bottom green hollow, saw Goldberry, small slender like sunlit flower sky: standing still watching them, hands stretched towards them. looked gave clear call, lifting hand turned vanished behind hill. way wound along floor hollow, round green feet steep hill another deeper broader valley, shoulders hills, long limbs, smooth sides again, new hill-tops new valleys. tree visible water: country grass short springy turf, silent except whisper air edges land, high lonely cries strange birds. journeyed sun mounted, grew hot. time climbed ridge breeze seemed grown less. caught glimpse country westward distant Forest seemed smoking, fallen rain steaming leaf root mould. shadow lay round edge sight, dark haze upper sky like blue cap, hot heavy. mid-day came hill whose top wide flattened, like shallow saucer green mounded rim. Inside air stirring, sky seemed near heads. rode across looked northwards. hearts rose; seemed plain come already expected. Certainly distances become hazy deceptive, could doubt Downs coming end. long valley lay winding away northwards, came opening two steep shoulders. Beyond, seemed hills. Due north faintly glimpsed long dark line. ‘That line trees,’ said Merry, ‘and must mark Road. along many leagues east Bridge trees growing. say planted old days.’ ‘Splendid!’ said Frodo. ‘If make good going afternoon done morning, shall left Downs Sun sets jogging search camping place.’ even spoke turned glance eastwards, saw side hills higher looked upon them; hills crowned green mounds, standing stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth green gums. view somehow disquieting; turned sight went hollow circle. midst stood single stone, standing tall sun above, hour casting shadow. shapeless yet significant: like landmark, guarding finger, like warning. hungry, sun still fearless noon; set backs east side stone. cool, sun power warm it; time seemed pleasant. took food drink, made good noonmeal open sky anyone could wish; food came ‘down Hill’. Tom provided plenty comfort day. ponies unburdened strayed upon grass. Riding hills, eating fill, warm sun scent turf, lying little long, stretching legs looking sky noses: things are, perhaps, enough explain happened. However may be: woke suddenly uncomfortably sleep never meant take. standing stone cold, cast long pale shadow stretched eastward them. sun, pale watery yellow, gleaming mist west wall hollow lay; north, south, east, beyond wall fog thick, cold white. air silent, heavy chill. ponies standing crowded together heads down. hobbits sprang feet alarm, ran western rim. found upon island fog.

Sam behind him, came Pippin, Merry. valley seemed stretch endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw hopeful sign. either side ahead darkness began loom mist; guessed last approaching gap hills, north-gate Barrow-downs. could pass that, would free. ‘Come on! Follow me!’ called back shoulder, hurried forward. hope soon changed bewilderment alarm. dark patches grew darker, shrank; suddenly saw, towering ominous leaning slightly towards one another like pillars headless door, two huge standing stones. could remember seen sign valley, looked hill morning. passed almost aware: even darkness seemed fall round him. pony reared snorted, fell off. looked back found alone: others followed him. ‘Sam!’ called. ‘Pippin!

Frodo neither fat timid; indeed, though know it, Bilbo (and Gandalf) thought best hobbit Shire. thought come end adventure, terrible end, thought hardened him. found stiffening, final spring; longer felt limp like helpless prey. lay there, thinking getting hold himself, noticed darkness slowly giving way: pale greenish light growing round him. first show kind place in, light seemed coming himself, floor beside him, yet reached roof wall. turned, cold glow saw lying beside Sam, Pippin, Merry. backs, faces looked deathly pale; clad white. lay many treasures, gold maybe, though light looked cold unlovely. heads circlets, gold chains waists, fingers many rings. Swords lay sides, shields feet. across three necks lay one long naked sword. * * * Suddenly song began: cold murmur, rising falling. voice seemed far away immeasurably dreary, sometimes high air thin, sometimes like low moan ground. formless stream sad horrible sounds, strings words would shape themselves: grim, hard, cold words, heartless miserable. night railing morning bereaved, cold cursing warmth hungered. Frodo chilled marrow. song became clearer, dread heart perceived changed incantation: Cold hand heart bone, cold sleep stone: never wake stony bed, never, till Sun fails Moon dead. black wind stars shall die, still gold let lie, till dark lord lifts hand dead sea withered land. heard behind head creaking scraping sound. Raising one arm looked, saw pale light kind passage behind turned corner. Round corner long arm groping, walking fingers towards Sam, lying nearest, towards hilt sword lay upon him. first Frodo felt indeed turned stone incantation. wild thought escape came him. wondered put Ring, whether Barrow-wight would miss him, might find way out. thought running free grass, grieving Merry, Sam, Pippin, free alive himself.

Far away hill could hear sound singing falling high like soft rain upon leaves. went along many paths climbed many stairs, came high places saw amid wide lawn fountain shimmering. lit silver lamps swung boughs trees, fell basin silver, white stream spilled. Upon south side lawn stood mightiest trees; great smooth bole gleamed like grey silk, towered, first branches, far above, opened huge limbs shadowy clouds leaves. Beside broad white ladder stood, foot three Elves seated. sprang travellers approached, Frodo saw tall clad grey mail, shoulders hung long white cloaks. ‘Here dwell Celeborn Galadriel,’ said Haldir. ‘It wish ascend speak them.’ One Elf-wardens blew clear note small horn, answered three times far above. ‘I go first,’ said Haldir. ‘Let Frodo come next Legolas. others may follow wish. long climb accustomed stairs, may rest upon way.’ climbed slowly Frodo passed many flets: one side, another, set bole tree, ladder passed them. great height ground came wide talan, like deck great ship. built house, large almost would served hall Men upon earth. entered behind Haldir, found chamber oval shape, midst grew trunk great mallorn, tapering towards crown, yet making still pillar wide girth. chamber filled soft light; walls green silver roof gold.

Even so, dark shape, like cloud yet cloud, moved far swiftly, came blackness South, sped towards Company, blotting light approached. Soon appeared great winged creature, blacker pits night. Fierce voices rose greet across water. Frodo felt sudden chill running clutching heart; deadly cold, like memory old wound, shoulder. crouched down, hide. Suddenly great bow Lo´rien sang. Shrill went arrow elven-string. Frodo looked up. Almost winged shape swerved. harsh croaking scream, fell air, vanishing gloom eastern shore. sky clean again. tumult many voices far away, cursing wailing darkness, silence. Neither shaft cry came east night. Aragorn led boats back upstream. felt way along water’s edge distance, found small shallow bay. low trees grew close water, behind rose steep rocky bank.

Slowly dawn grew pale light, diffused shadowless. mist River, white fog swathed shore; far bank could seen. ‘I can’t abide fog,’ said Sam; ‘but seems lucky one. perhaps get away without cursed goblins seeing us.’ ‘Perhaps so,’ said Aragorn. ‘But hard find path unless fog lifts little later on. must find path, pass Sarn Gebir come Emyn Muil.’ ‘I see pass Rapids follow River further,’ said Boromir. ‘If Emyn Muil lie us, abandon cockle-boats, strike westward southward, come Entwash cross land.’ ‘We can, making Minas Tirith,’ said Aragorn, ‘but yet agreed. course may perilous sounds. vale Entwash flat fenny, fog deadly peril foot laden. would abandon boats must.

Aragorn hoped find way could carry boats baggage smoother water beyond Rapids. ‘Boats Elves would sink, maybe,’ said, ‘but say come Sarn Gebir alive.

Frodo peering forward saw distance two great rocks approaching: like great pinnacles pillars stone seemed. Tall sheer ominous stood upon either side stream. narrow gap appeared them, River swept boats towards it. ‘Behold Argonath, Pillars Kings!’ cried Aragorn. ‘We shall pass soon. Keep boats line, far apart can! Hold middle stream!’ Frodo borne towards great pillars rose like towers meet him. Giants seemed him, vast grey figures silent threatening. saw indeed shaped fashioned: craft power old wrought upon them, still preserved suns rains forgotten years mighty likenesses hewn. Upon great pedestals founded deep waters stood two great kings stone: still blurred eyes crannied brows frowned upon North. left hand raised palm outwards gesture warning; right hand axe; upon head crumbling helm crown. Great power majesty still wore, silent wardens long-vanished kingdom. Awe fear fell upon Frodo, cowered down, shutting eyes daring look boat drew near.

Frodo turned saw Strider, yet Strider; weatherworn Ranger longer there. stern sat Aragorn son Arathorn, proud erect, guiding boat skilful strokes; hood cast back, dark hair blowing wind, light eyes: king returning exile land. ‘Fear not!’ said. ‘Long desired look upon likenesses Isildur Ana´rion, sires old. shadow Elessar, Elfstone son Arathorn House Valandil Isildur’s son, heir Elendil, naught dread!’ light eyes faded, spoke himself: ‘Would Gandalf here! heart yearns Minas Anor walls city! whither shall go?’ chasm long dark, filled noise wind rushing water echoing stone. bent somewhat towards west first dark ahead; soon Frodo saw tall gap light him, ever growing. Swiftly drew near, suddenly boats shot through, wide clear light. sun, already long fallen noon, shining windy sky. pent waters spread long oval lake, pale Nen Hithoel, fenced steep grey hills whose sides clad trees, heads bare, cold-gleaming sunlight. far southern end rose three peaks. midmost stood somewhat forward others sundered them, island waters, flowing River flung pale shimmering arms.

Nonetheless night wore Aragorn grew uneasy, tossing often sleep waking. small hours got came Frodo, whose turn watch. ‘Why waking?’ asked Frodo. ‘It watch.’ ‘I know,’ answered Aragorn; ‘but shadow threat growing sleep. would well draw sword.’ ‘Why?’ said Frodo. ‘Are enemies hand?’ ‘Let us see Sting may show,’ answered Aragorn. Frodo drew elf-blade sheath. dismay edges gleamed dimly night. ‘Orcs!’ said. ‘Not near, yet near, seems.’ ‘I feared much,’ said Aragorn. ‘But maybe side River. light Sting faint, may point spies Mordor roaming slopes Amon Lhaw. never heard Orcs upon Amon Hen. Yet knows may happen evil days, Minas Tirith longer holds secure passages Anduin. must go warily tomorrow.’ day came like fire smoke. Low East black bars cloud like fumes great burning. rising sun lit beneath flames murky red; soon climbed clear sky. summit Tol Brandir tipped gold. Frodo looked eastward gazed tall island. sides sprang sheer running water. High tall cliffs steep slopes upon trees climbed, mounting one head another; grey faces inaccessible rock, crowned great spire stone. Many birds circling it, sign living things could seen. eaten, Aragorn called Company together. ‘The day come last,’ said: ‘the day choice long delayed. shall become Company travelled far fellowship?

Terror grief shook him, seeing thought mad fierce face Boromir, burning eyes. Soon came alone summit Amon Hen, halted, gasping breath. saw mist wide flat circle, paved mighty flags, surrounded crumbling battlement; middle, set upon four carven pillars, high seat, reached stair many steps. went sat upon ancient chair, feeling like lost child clambered upon throne mountainkings. first could see little. seemed world mist shadows: Ring upon him. mist gave way saw many visions: small clear eyes upon table, yet remote. sound, bright living images. world seemed shrunk fallen silent. sitting upon Seat Seeing, Amon Hen, Hill Eye Men Nu´menor.

Though hobbits ate, famished hobbits eat, lack. drink drinking-bowls seemed clear cold water, yet went hearts like wine set free voices. guests became suddenly aware singing merrily, easier natural talking. last Tom Goldberry rose cleared table swiftly. guests commanded sit quiet, set chairs, footstool tired feet. fire wide hearth them, burning sweet smell, built apple-wood. everything set order, lights room put out, except one lamp pair candles end chimney-shelf. Goldberry stood them, holding candle; wished good night deep sleep. ‘Have peace now,’ said, ‘until morning! Heed nightly noises! nothing passes door window save moonlight starlight wind hill-top. Good night!’ passed room glimmer rustle. sound footsteps like stream falling gently away downhill cool stones quiet night. Tom sat beside silence, tried muster courage ask one questions meant ask supper. Sleep gathered eyelids. last Frodo spoke: ‘Did hear calling, Master, chance brought moment?’ Tom stirred like man shaken pleasant dream. ‘Eh, what?’ he. ‘Did hear calling? Nay, hear: busy singing. chance brought then, chance call it. plan mine, though waiting you. heard news you, learned wandering. guessed you’d ere long water: paths lead way, Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he’s mighty singer; it’s hard little folk escape cunning mazes. Tom errand there, dared hinder.’ Tom nodded sleep taking again; went soft singing voice: errand there: gathering water-lilies, green leaves lilies white please pretty lady, last ere year’s end keep winter, flower pretty feet till snows melted. year summer’s end go find her, wide pool, deep clear, far Withywindle; open first spring linger latest. pool long ago found River-daughter, fair young Goldberry sitting rushes. Sweet singing then, heart beating! opened eyes looked sudden glint blue: proved well – shall longer go deep along forest-water, year old. shall passing Old Man Willow’s house side spring-time, till merry spring, River-daughter dances withy-path bathe water. fell silent again; Frodo help asking one question: one desired answered. ‘Tell us, Master,’ said, ‘about Willow-man. he? never heard before.’ ‘No, don’t!’ Merry Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright. ‘Not now! morning!’ ‘That right!’ old man. ‘Now time resting. things ill hear world’s shadow. Sleep till morning-light, rest pillow! Heed nightly noise! Fear grey willow!’ took lamp blew out, grasping candle either hand led room. mattresses pillows soft down, blankets white wool. hardly laid deep beds drawn light covers asleep. dead night, Frodo lay dream without light. saw young moon rising; thin light loomed black wall rock, pierced dark arch like great gate. seemed Frodo lifted up, passing saw rock-wall circle hills, within plain, midst plain stood pinnacle stone, like vast tower made hands. top stood figure man. moon rose seemed hang moment head glistened white hair wind stirred it. dark plain crying fell voices, howling wolves. Suddenly shadow, like shape great wings, passed across moon. figure lifted arms light flashed staff wielded. mighty eagle swept bore away. voices wailed wolves yammered. noise like strong wind blowing, borne sound hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping East. ‘Black Riders!’ thought Frodo wakened, sound hoofs echoing mind. wondered ever courage leave safety stone walls. lay motionless, listening; silent, last turned fell asleep wandered unremembered dream. side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; change dreams turned groaned. Suddenly woke, thought waked, yet heard darkness sound disturbed dream: tip-tap, squeak: noise like branches fretting wind, twig-fingers scraping wall window: creak, creak, creak. wondered willow-trees close house; suddenly dreadful feeling ordinary house all, inside willow listening horrible dry creaking voice laughing again. sat up, felt soft pillows yield hands, lay relieved. seemed hear echo words ears: ‘Fear nothing! peace morning! Heed nightly noises!’ went sleep again. sound water Merry heard falling quiet sleep: water streaming gently, spreading, spreading irresistibly round house dark shoreless pool. gurgled walls, rising slowly surely. ‘I shall drowned!’ thought. ‘It find way in, shall drown.’ felt lying soft slimy bog, springing set foot corner cold hard flagstone. remembered lay again. seemed hear remember hearing: ‘Nothing passes doors windows save moonlight starlight wind hill-top.’ little breath sweet air moved curtain. breathed deep fell asleep again. far remember, Sam slept night deep content, logs contented. woke up, four once, morning light. Tom moving room whistling like starling. heard stir clapped hands, cried: ‘Hey! merry dol! derry dol! hearties!’ drew back yellow curtains, hobbits saw covered windows, either end room, one looking east looking west. leapt refreshed. Frodo ran eastern window, found looking kitchen-garden grey dew. half expected see turf right walls, turf pocked hoof-prints. Actually view screened tall line beans poles; far beyond grey top hill loomed sunrise. pale morning: East, behind long clouds like lines soiled wool stained red edges, lay glimmering deeps yellow. sky spoke rain come; light broadening quickly, red flowers beans began glow wet green leaves. Pippin looked western window, pool mist. Forest hidden fog. like looking sloping cloud-roof above. fold channel mist broken plumes billows: valley Withywindle. stream ran hill left vanished white shadows. Near hand flower-garden clipped hedge silver-netted, beyond grey shaven grass pale dew-drops. willow-tree seen. ‘Good morning, merry friends!’ cried Tom, opening eastern window wide. cool air flowed in; rainy smell. ‘Sun won’t show face much today, I’m thinking. walking wide, leaping hill-tops, since grey dawn began, nosing wind weather, wet grass underfoot, wet sky me. wakened Goldberry singing window; naught wakes hobbit-folk early morning. night little folk wake darkness, sleep light come! Ring ding dillo! Wake now, merry friends! Forget nightly noises! Ring ding dillo del! derry del, hearties! soon you’ll find breakfast table. late you’ll get grass rain-water!’ Needless say – Tom’s threat sounded serious – hobbits soon, left table late beginning look rather empty. Neither Tom Goldberry there. Tom heard house, clattering kitchen, stairs, singing outside. room looked westward mist-clouded valley, window open. Water dripped thatched eaves above. finished breakfast clouds joined unbroken roof, straight grey rain softly steadily down. Behind deep curtain Forest completely veiled. looked window falling gently flowing rain sky, clear voice Goldberry singing them. hear words, seemed plain song rain-song, sweet showers dry hills, told tale river spring highlands Sea far below. hobbits listened delight; Frodo glad heart, blessed kindly weather, delayed departing. thought going heavy upon moment awoke; guessed go day. upper wind settled West deeper wetter clouds rolled spill laden rain bare heads Downs. Nothing seen round house falling water. Frodo stood near open door watched white chalky path turn little river milk go bubbling away valley. Tom Bombadil trotting round corner house, waving arms warding rain – indeed sprang threshold seemed quite dry, except boots. took put chimney-corner. sat largest chair called hobbits gather round him. ‘This Goldberry’s washing day,’ said, ‘and autumn-cleaning. wet hobbit-folk – let rest able! It’s good day long tales, questions answers, Tom start talking.’ told remarkable stories, sometimes half speaking himself, sometimes looking suddenly bright blue eye deep brows. Often voice turn song, get chair dance about. told tales bees flowers, ways trees, strange creatures Forest, evil things good things, things friendly things unfriendly, cruel things kind things, secrets hidden brambles. listened, began understand lives Forest, apart themselves, indeed feel strangers things home. Moving constantly talk Old Man Willow, Frodo learned enough content him, indeed enough, comfortable lore. Tom’s words laid bare hearts trees thoughts, often dark strange, filled hatred things go free upon earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers usurpers. called Old Forest without reason, indeed ancient, survivor vast forgotten woods; lived yet, ageing quicker hills, fathers fathers trees, remembering times lords. countless years filled pride rooted wisdom, malice. none dangerous Great Willow: heart rotten, strength green; cunning, master winds, song thought ran woods sides river. grey thirsty spirit drew power earth spread like fine root-threads ground, invisible twig-fingers air, till dominion nearly trees Forest Hedge Downs. Suddenly Tom’s talk left woods went leaping young stream, bubbling waterfalls, pebbles worn rocks, among small flowers close grass wet crannies, wandering last Downs. heard Great Barrows, green mounds, stonerings upon hills hollows among hills. Sheep bleating flocks. Green walls white walls rose. fortresses heights. Kings little kingdoms fought together, young Sun shone like fire red metal new greedy swords. victory defeat; towers fell, fortresses burned, flames went sky. Gold piled biers dead kings queens; mounds covered them, stone doors shut; grass grew all. Sheep walked biting grass, soon hills empty again. shadow dark places far away, bones stirred mounds. Barrow-wights walked hollow places clink rings cold fingers, gold chains wind. Stone rings grinned ground like broken teeth moonlight. hobbits shuddered. Even Shire rumour Barrow-wights Barrow-downs beyond Forest heard. tale hobbit liked listen to, even comfortable fireside far away. four suddenly remembered joy house driven minds: house Tom Bombadil nestled shoulder dreaded hills. lost thread tale shifted uneasily, looking aside one another. caught words found wandered strange regions beyond memory beyond waking thought, times world wider, seas flowed straight western Shore; back Tom went singing ancient starlight, Elf-sires awake. suddenly stopped, saw nodded falling asleep. hobbits sat him, enchanted; seemed if, spell words, wind gone, clouds dried up, day withdrawn, darkness East West, sky filled light white stars. Whether morning evening one day days passed Frodo tell. feel either hungry tired, filled wonder. stars shone window silence heavens seemed round him. spoke last wonder sudden fear silence: ‘Who you, Master?’ asked. ‘Eh, what?’ Tom sitting up, eyes glinting gloom. ‘Don’t know name yet? That’s answer. Tell me, you, alone, nameless? young old. Eldest, that’s am. Mark words, friends: Tom river trees; Tom remembers first raindrop first acorn. made paths Big People, saw little People arriving. Kings graves Barrow-wights. Elves passed westward, Tom already, seas bent. knew dark stars fearless – Dark Lord Outside.’ shadow seemed pass window, hobbits glanced hastily panes. turned again, Goldberry stood door behind, framed light. held candle, shielding flame draught hand; light flowed it, like sunlight white shell. ‘The rain ended,’ said; ‘and new waters running downhill, stars. Let us laugh glad!’ ‘And let us food drink!’ cried Tom. ‘Long tales thirsty. long listening’s hungry work, morning, noon, evening!’ jumped chair, bound took candle chimney-shelf lit flame Goldberry held; danced table. Suddenly hopped door disappeared. Quickly returned, bearing large laden tray. Tom Goldberry set table; hobbits sat half wonder half laughter: fair grace Goldberry merry odd caperings Tom. Yet fashion seemed weave single dance, neither hindering other, room, round table; great speed food vessels lights set order. boards blazed candles, white yellow. Tom bowed guests. ‘Supper ready,’ Goldberry; hobbits saw clothed silver white girdle, shoes like fishes’ mail. Tom clean blue, blue rain-washed forget-me-nots, green stockings. supper even better before. hobbits spell Tom’s words may missed one meal many, food seemed least week since eaten. sing even speak much while, paid close attention business. time hearts spirits rose high again, voices rang mirth laughter. eaten, Goldberry sang songs them, songs began merrily hills fell softly silence; silences saw minds pools waters wider known, looking saw sky stars like jewels depths. wished good night left fireside. Tom seemed wide awake plied questions. appeared already know much families, indeed know much history doings Shire days hardly remembered among hobbits themselves. longer surprised them; made secret owed recent knowledge largely Farmer Maggot, seemed regard person importance imagined. ‘There’s earth old feet, clay fingers; wisdom bones, eyes open,’ Tom. also clear Tom dealings Elves, seemed fashion, news reached Gildor concerning flight Frodo. Indeed much Tom know, cunning questioning, Frodo found telling Bilbo hopes fears told even Gandalf. Tom wagged head down, glint eyes heard Riders. ‘Show precious Ring!’ suddenly midst story: Frodo, astonishment, drew chain pocket, unfastening Ring handed Tom. seemed grow larger lay moment big brown-skinned hand. suddenly put eye laughed. second hobbits vision, comical alarming, bright blue eye gleaming circle gold. Tom put Ring round end little finger held candlelight. moment hobbits noticed nothing strange this. gasped. sign Tom disappearing! Tom laughed again, spun Ring air – vanished flash. Frodo gave cry – Tom leaned forward handed back smile. Frodo looked closely, rather suspiciously (like one lent trinket juggler). Ring, looked weighed same: Ring always seemed Frodo weigh strangely heavy hand. something prompted make sure. perhaps trifle annoyed Tom seeming make light even Gandalf thought perilously important. waited opportunity, talk going again, Tom telling absurd story badgers queer ways – slipped Ring on. Merry turned towards say something gave start, checked exclamation. Frodo delighted (in way): ring right, Merry staring blankly chair, obviously see him. got crept quietly away fireside towards outer door. ‘Hey there!’ cried Tom, glancing towards seeing look shining eyes. ‘Hey! Frodo, there! a-going? Old Tom Bombadil’s blind yet. Take golden ring! hand’s fair without it. back! Leave game sit beside me! must talk more, think morning.

Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! water, wood hill, reed willow, fire, sun moon, harken hear us! Come, Tom Bombadil, need near us! sung altogether him, clapped shoulder laugh, taking candles led back bedroom. Chapter 8 FOG BARROW-DOWNS night heard noises. either dreams them, tell which, Frodo heard sweet singing running mind: song seemed like pale light behind grey rain-curtain, growing stronger turn veil glass silver, last rolled back, far green country opened swift sunrise. vision melted waking; Tom whistling like tree-full birds; sun already slanting hill open window. Outside everything green pale gold. breakfast, ate alone, made ready say farewell, nearly heavy heart possible morning: cool, bright, clean washed autumn sky thin blue. air fresh Northwest. quiet ponies almost frisky, sniffing moving restlessly.

Elves spread pavilion among trees near fountain, laid soft couches; speaking words peace fair Elvish voices left them. little travellers talked night tree-tops, day’s journey, Lord Lady; yet heart look back. ‘What blush for, Sam?’ Pippin. ‘You soon broke down.

Frodo, speak, though Boromir pressed questions. ‘She held long gaze, Ring-bearer,’ said. ‘Yes,’ Frodo; ‘but whatever mind keep there.’ ‘Well, care!’ Boromir. ‘I feel sure Elvish Lady purposes.’ ‘Speak evil Lady Galadriel!’ Aragorn sternly. ‘You know say. land evil, unless man bring hither himself. let beware! tonight shall sleep without fear first time since left Rivendell. may sleep deep, forget grief! weary body heart.’ cast upon couch fell long sleep. others soon same, sound dream disturbed slumber. woke found light day broad upon lawn pavilion, fountain rose fell glittering sun. remained days Lothlo´rien, far tell remember. dwelt sun shone clear, save gentle rain fell times, passed away leaving things fresh clean. air cool soft, early spring, yet felt deep thoughtful quiet winter. seemed little eat drink rest, walk among trees; enough. seen Lord Lady again, little speech Elven-folk; knew use Westron tongue.

Often heard nearby Elvish voices singing, knew making songs lamentation fall, caught name among sweet sad words understand. Mithrandir, Mithrandir sang Elves, Pilgrim Grey! loved call him.

Frodo first put something sorrow halting words. seldom moved make song rhyme; even Rivendell listened sung himself, though memory stored things others made him. sat beside fountain Lo´rien heard voices Elves, thought took shape song seemed fair him; yet tried repeat Sam snatches remained, faded handful withered leaves. evening Shire grey footsteps Hill heard; dawn went away journey long without word.

Though doesn’t justice long road.’ ‘No, I’ll leave you, Sam. perhaps Bilbo. – well, can’t talk more. can’t bear think bringing news him.’ One evening Frodo Sam walking together cool twilight. felt restless again. Frodo suddenly shadow parting fallen: knew somehow time near must leave Lothlo´rien. ‘What think Elves now, Sam?’ said. ‘I asked question – seems long ago; seen since then.’ ‘I indeed!’ Sam. ‘And reckon there’s Elves Elves. They’re Elvish enough, they’re same. folk aren’t wanderers homeless, seem bit nearer likes us: seem belong here, even Hobbits Shire. Whether they’ve made land, land’s made them, it’s hard say, take meaning. It’s wonderfully quiet here. Nothing seems going on, nobody seems want to. there’s magic about, it’s right deep, can’t lay hands it, manner speaking.’ ‘You see feel everywhere,’ Frodo. ‘Well,’ Sam, ‘you can’t see nobody working it. fireworks like poor old Gandalf used show. wonder don’t see nothing Lord Lady days. fancy wonderful things, mind.

Since 1974, Christopher Tolkien sent additional corrections, errors discovered, British publishers Lord Rings (Allen & Unwin, later Unwin Hyman, HarperCollins), tried conscientious impossible task maintaining textual integrity whichever editions Lord Rings published. However, every time text reset publication new format (e.g. various paperback editions published England 1970s 1980s), huge numbers new misprints crept in, though times errors observed corrected later printings. Still, throughout years three-volume British hardcover edition retained highest textual integrity.

Chapter 7 HOUSE TOM BOMBADIL four hobbits stepped wide stone threshold, stood still, blinking. long low room, filled light lamps swinging beams roof; table dark polished wood stood candles, tall yellow, burning brightly. chair, far side room facing outer door, sat woman. long yellow hair rippled shoulders; gown green, green young reeds, shot silver like beads dew; belt gold, shaped like chain flag-lilies set pale-blue eyes forgetme-nots. feet wide vessels green brown earthenware, white water-lilies floating, seemed enthroned midst pool. ‘Enter, good guests!’ said, spoke knew clear voice heard singing. timid steps room, began bow low, feeling strangely surprised awkward, like folk that, knocking cottage door beg drink water, answered fair young elf-queen clad living flowers. say anything, sprang lightly lily-bowls, ran laughing towards them; ran gown rustled softly like wind flowering borders river. ‘Comedearfolk!’shesaid,takingFrodobythehand.‘Laugh merry!

Fair River-daughter! spring-time summer-time, spring after! wind waterfall, leaves’ laughter!’ Suddenly stopped stammered, overcome surprise hear saying things. Goldberry laughed. ‘Welcome!’ said. ‘I heard folk Shire sweet-tongued. see Elf-friend; light eyes ring voice tells it. merry meeting!

Every caught, among derry dol merry dol ring ding dillo repeated words: Old Tom Bombadil merry fellow; Bright blue jacket is, boots yellow. ‘Fair lady!’ Frodo while. ‘Tell me, asking seem foolish, Tom Bombadil?’ ‘He is,’ Goldberry, staying swift movements smiling. Frodo looked questioningly. ‘He is, seen him,’ answer look. ‘He Master wood, water, hill.’ ‘Then strange land belongs him?’ ‘No indeed!’ answered, smile faded. ‘That indeed burden,’ added low voice, herself. ‘The trees grasses things growing living land belong themselves.

Tom Bombadil master.’ door opened Tom Bombadil. hat thick brown hair crowned autumn leaves. laughed, going Goldberry, took hand. ‘Here’s pretty lady!’ said, bowing hobbits. ‘Here’s Goldberry clothed silver-green flowers girdle! table laden? see yellow cream honeycomb, white bread, butter; milk, cheese, green herbs ripe berries gathered. enough us? supper ready?’ ‘It is,’ Goldberry; ‘but guests perhaps not?’ Tom clapped hands cried: ‘Tom, Tom! guests tired, near forgotten! now, merry friends, Tom refresh you! shall clean grimy hands, wash weary faces; cast muddy cloaks comb tangles!’ opened door, followed short passage round sharp turn. low room sloping roof (a penthouse, seemed, built north end house). walls clean stone, mostly covered green hanging mats yellow curtains. floor flagged, strewn fresh green rushes. four deep mattresses, piled white blankets, laid floor along one side. opposite wall long bench laden wide earthenware basins, beside stood brown ewers filled water, cold, steaming hot. soft green slippers set ready beside bed. long, washed refreshed, hobbits seated table, two side, either end sat Goldberry Master. long merry meal. Though hobbits ate, famished hobbits eat, lack. drink drinking-bowls seemed clear cold water, yet went hearts like wine set free voices. guests became suddenly aware singing merrily, easier natural talking. last Tom Goldberry rose cleared table swiftly. guests commanded sit quiet, set chairs, footstool tired feet. fire wide hearth them, burning sweet smell, built apple-wood. everything set order, lights room put out, except one lamp pair candles end chimney-shelf. Goldberry stood them, holding candle; wished good night deep sleep. ‘Have peace now,’ said, ‘until morning! Heed nightly noises! nothing passes door window save moonlight starlight wind hill-top. Good night!’ passed room glimmer rustle. sound footsteps like stream falling gently away downhill cool stones quiet night. Tom sat beside silence, tried muster courage ask one questions meant ask supper. Sleep gathered eyelids. last Frodo spoke: ‘Did hear calling, Master, chance brought moment?’ Tom stirred like man shaken pleasant dream. ‘Eh, what?’ he. ‘Did hear calling? Nay, hear: busy singing. chance brought then, chance call it. plan mine, though waiting you. heard news you, learned wandering. guessed you’d ere long water: paths lead way, Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he’s mighty singer; it’s hard little folk escape cunning mazes. Tom errand there, dared hinder.’ Tom nodded sleep taking again; went soft singing voice: errand there: gathering water-lilies, green leaves lilies white please pretty lady, last ere year’s end keep winter, flower pretty feet till snows melted. year summer’s end go find her, wide pool, deep clear, far Withywindle; open first spring linger latest. pool long ago found River-daughter, fair young Goldberry sitting rushes. Sweet singing then, heart beating! opened eyes looked sudden glint blue: proved well – shall longer go deep along forest-water, year old. shall passing Old Man Willow’s house side spring-time, till merry spring, River-daughter dances withy-path bathe water. fell silent again; Frodo help asking one question: one desired answered. ‘Tell us, Master,’ said, ‘about Willow-man. he? never heard before.’ ‘No, don’t!’ Merry Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright. ‘Not now! morning!’ ‘That right!’ old man. ‘Now time resting. things ill hear world’s shadow. Sleep till morning-light, rest pillow! Heed nightly noise! Fear grey willow!’ took lamp blew out, grasping candle either hand led room. mattresses pillows soft down, blankets white wool. hardly laid deep beds drawn light covers asleep. dead night, Frodo lay dream without light. saw young moon rising; thin light loomed black wall rock, pierced dark arch like great gate. seemed Frodo lifted up, passing saw rock-wall circle hills, within plain, midst plain stood pinnacle stone, like vast tower made hands. top stood figure man. moon rose seemed hang moment head glistened white hair wind stirred it. dark plain crying fell voices, howling wolves. Suddenly shadow, like shape great wings, passed across moon. figure lifted arms light flashed staff wielded. mighty eagle swept bore away. voices wailed wolves yammered. noise like strong wind blowing, borne sound hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping East. ‘Black Riders!’ thought Frodo wakened, sound hoofs echoing mind. wondered ever courage leave safety stone walls. lay motionless, listening; silent, last turned fell asleep wandered unremembered dream. side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; change dreams turned groaned. Suddenly woke, thought waked, yet heard darkness sound disturbed dream: tip-tap, squeak: noise like branches fretting wind, twig-fingers scraping wall window: creak, creak, creak. wondered willow-trees close house; suddenly dreadful feeling ordinary house all, inside willow listening horrible dry creaking voice laughing again. sat up, felt soft pillows yield hands, lay relieved. seemed hear echo words ears: ‘Fear nothing! peace morning! Heed nightly noises!’ went sleep again. sound water Merry heard falling quiet sleep: water streaming gently, spreading, spreading irresistibly round house dark shoreless pool. gurgled walls, rising slowly surely. ‘I shall drowned!’ thought. ‘It find way in, shall drown.’ felt lying soft slimy bog, springing set foot corner cold hard flagstone. remembered lay again. seemed hear remember hearing: ‘Nothing passes doors windows save moonlight starlight wind hill-top.’ little breath sweet air moved curtain. breathed deep fell asleep again. far remember, Sam slept night deep content, logs contented. woke up, four once, morning light. Tom moving room whistling like starling. heard stir clapped hands, cried: ‘Hey! merry dol! derry dol! hearties!’ drew back yellow curtains, hobbits saw covered windows, either end room, one looking east looking west. leapt refreshed. Frodo ran eastern window, found looking kitchen-garden grey dew. half expected see turf right walls, turf pocked hoof-prints. Actually view screened tall line beans poles; far beyond grey top hill loomed sunrise. pale morning: East, behind long clouds like lines soiled wool stained red edges, lay glimmering deeps yellow. sky spoke rain come; light broadening quickly, red flowers beans began glow wet green leaves. Pippin looked western window, pool mist. Forest hidden fog. like looking sloping cloud-roof above. fold channel mist broken plumes billows: valley Withywindle. stream ran hill left vanished white shadows. Near hand flower-garden clipped hedge silver-netted, beyond grey shaven grass pale dew-drops. willow-tree seen. ‘Good morning, merry friends!’ cried Tom, opening eastern window wide. cool air flowed in; rainy smell. ‘Sun won’t show face much today, I’m thinking. walking wide, leaping hill-tops, since grey dawn began, nosing wind weather, wet grass underfoot, wet sky me. wakened Goldberry singing window; naught wakes hobbit-folk early morning. night little folk wake darkness, sleep light come! Ring ding dillo! Wake now, merry friends! Forget nightly noises! Ring ding dillo del! derry del, hearties! soon you’ll find breakfast table. late you’ll get grass rain-water!’ Needless say – Tom’s threat sounded serious – hobbits soon, left table late beginning look rather empty. Neither Tom Goldberry there. Tom heard house, clattering kitchen, stairs, singing outside. room looked westward mist-clouded valley, window open. Water dripped thatched eaves above. finished breakfast clouds joined unbroken roof, straight grey rain softly steadily down. Behind deep curtain Forest completely veiled. looked window falling gently flowing rain sky, clear voice Goldberry singing them. hear words, seemed plain song rain-song, sweet showers dry hills, told tale river spring highlands Sea far below. hobbits listened delight; Frodo glad heart, blessed kindly weather, delayed departing. thought going heavy upon moment awoke; guessed go day. upper wind settled West deeper wetter clouds rolled spill laden rain bare heads Downs. Nothing seen round house falling water. Frodo stood near open door watched white chalky path turn little river milk go bubbling away valley. Tom Bombadil trotting round corner house, waving arms warding rain – indeed sprang threshold seemed quite dry, except boots. took put chimney-corner. sat largest chair called hobbits gather round him. ‘This Goldberry’s washing day,’ said, ‘and autumn-cleaning. wet hobbit-folk – let rest able! It’s good day long tales, questions answers, Tom start talking.’ told remarkable stories, sometimes half speaking himself, sometimes looking suddenly bright blue eye deep brows. Often voice turn song, get chair dance about. told tales bees flowers, ways trees, strange creatures Forest, evil things good things, things friendly things unfriendly, cruel things kind things, secrets hidden brambles. listened, began understand lives Forest, apart themselves, indeed feel strangers things home. Moving constantly talk Old Man Willow, Frodo learned enough content him, indeed enough, comfortable lore. Tom’s words laid bare hearts trees thoughts, often dark strange, filled hatred things go free upon earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers usurpers. called Old Forest without reason, indeed ancient, survivor vast forgotten woods; lived yet, ageing quicker hills, fathers fathers trees, remembering times lords. countless years filled pride rooted wisdom, malice. none dangerous Great Willow: heart rotten, strength green; cunning, master winds, song thought ran woods sides river. grey thirsty spirit drew power earth spread like fine root-threads ground, invisible twig-fingers air, till dominion nearly trees Forest Hedge Downs. Suddenly Tom’s talk left woods went leaping young stream, bubbling waterfalls, pebbles worn rocks, among small flowers close grass wet crannies, wandering last Downs. heard Great Barrows, green mounds, stonerings upon hills hollows among hills. Sheep bleating flocks. Green walls white walls rose. fortresses heights. Kings little kingdoms fought together, young Sun shone like fire red metal new greedy swords. victory defeat; towers fell, fortresses burned, flames went sky. Gold piled biers dead kings queens; mounds covered them, stone doors shut; grass grew all. Sheep walked biting grass, soon hills empty again. shadow dark places far away, bones stirred mounds. Barrow-wights walked hollow places clink rings cold fingers, gold chains wind. Stone rings grinned ground like broken teeth moonlight. hobbits shuddered. Even Shire rumour Barrow-wights Barrow-downs beyond Forest heard. tale hobbit liked listen to, even comfortable fireside far away. four suddenly remembered joy house driven minds: house Tom Bombadil nestled shoulder dreaded hills. lost thread tale shifted uneasily, looking aside one another. caught words found wandered strange regions beyond memory beyond waking thought, times world wider, seas flowed straight western Shore; back Tom went singing ancient starlight, Elf-sires awake. suddenly stopped, saw nodded falling asleep. hobbits sat him, enchanted; seemed if, spell words, wind gone, clouds dried up, day withdrawn, darkness East West, sky filled light white stars. Whether morning evening one day days passed Frodo tell. feel either hungry tired, filled wonder. stars shone window silence heavens seemed round him. spoke last wonder sudden fear silence: ‘Who you, Master?’ asked. ‘Eh, what?’ Tom sitting up, eyes glinting gloom. ‘Don’t know name yet? That’s answer. Tell me, you, alone, nameless? young old. Eldest, that’s am. Mark words, friends: Tom river trees; Tom remembers first raindrop first acorn. made paths Big People, saw little People arriving. Kings graves Barrow-wights. Elves passed westward, Tom already, seas bent. knew dark stars fearless – Dark Lord Outside.’ shadow seemed pass window, hobbits glanced hastily panes. turned again, Goldberry stood door behind, framed light. held candle, shielding flame draught hand; light flowed it, like sunlight white shell. ‘The rain ended,’ said; ‘and new waters running downhill, stars. Let us laugh glad!’ ‘And let us food drink!’ cried Tom. ‘Long tales thirsty. long listening’s hungry work, morning, noon, evening!’ jumped chair, bound took candle chimney-shelf lit flame Goldberry held; danced table. Suddenly hopped door disappeared. Quickly returned, bearing large laden tray. Tom Goldberry set table; hobbits sat half wonder half laughter: fair grace Goldberry merry odd caperings Tom. Yet fashion seemed weave single dance, neither hindering other, room, round table; great speed food vessels lights set order. boards blazed candles, white yellow. Tom bowed guests. ‘Supper ready,’ Goldberry; hobbits saw clothed silver white girdle, shoes like fishes’ mail. Tom clean blue, blue rain-washed forget-me-nots, green stockings. supper even better before. hobbits spell Tom’s words may missed one meal many, food seemed least week since eaten. sing even speak much while, paid close attention business. time hearts spirits rose high again, voices rang mirth laughter. eaten, Goldberry sang songs them, songs began merrily hills fell softly silence; silences saw minds pools waters wider known, looking saw sky stars like jewels depths. wished good night left fireside. Tom seemed wide awake plied questions. appeared already know much families, indeed know much history doings Shire days hardly remembered among hobbits themselves. longer surprised them; made secret owed recent knowledge largely Farmer Maggot, seemed regard person importance imagined. ‘There’s earth old feet, clay fingers; wisdom bones, eyes open,’ Tom. also clear Tom dealings Elves, seemed fashion, news reached Gildor concerning flight Frodo. Indeed much Tom know, cunning questioning, Frodo found telling Bilbo hopes fears told even Gandalf. Tom wagged head down, glint eyes heard Riders. ‘Show precious Ring!’ suddenly midst story: Frodo, astonishment, drew chain pocket, unfastening Ring handed Tom. seemed grow larger lay moment big brown-skinned hand. suddenly put eye laughed. second hobbits vision, comical alarming, bright blue eye gleaming circle gold. Tom put Ring round end little finger held candlelight. moment hobbits noticed nothing strange this. gasped. sign Tom disappearing! Tom laughed again, spun Ring air – vanished flash. Frodo gave cry – Tom leaned forward handed back smile. Frodo looked closely, rather suspiciously (like one lent trinket juggler). Ring, looked weighed same: Ring always seemed Frodo weigh strangely heavy hand. something prompted make sure. perhaps trifle annoyed Tom seeming make light even Gandalf thought perilously important. waited opportunity, talk going again, Tom telling absurd story badgers queer ways – slipped Ring on. Merry turned towards say something gave start, checked exclamation. Frodo delighted (in way): ring right, Merry staring blankly chair, obviously see him. got crept quietly away fireside towards outer door. ‘Hey there!’ cried Tom, glancing towards seeing look shining eyes. ‘Hey! Frodo, there! a-going? Old Tom Bombadil’s blind yet. Take golden ring! hand’s fair without it. back! Leave game sit beside me! must talk more, think morning. Tom must teach right road, keep feet wandering.’ Frodo laughed (trying feel pleased), taking Ring sat again. Tom told reckoned Sun shine tomorrow, glad morning, setting hopeful. well start early; weather country thing even Tom sure long, change sometimes quicker change jacket. ‘I weather-master,’ he; ‘nor aught goes two legs.’ advice decided make nearly due North house, western lower slopes Downs: might hope way strike East Road day’s journey, avoid Barrows. told afraid – mind business. ‘Keep green grass.

Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! water, wood hill, reed willow, fire, sun moon, harken hear us! Come, Tom Bombadil, need near us! sung altogether him, clapped shoulder laugh, taking candles led back bedroom. Chapter 8 FOG BARROW-DOWNS night heard noises. either dreams them, tell which, Frodo heard sweet singing running mind: song seemed like pale light behind grey rain-curtain, growing stronger turn veil glass silver, last rolled back, far green country opened swift sunrise. vision melted waking; Tom whistling like tree-full birds; sun already slanting hill open window. Outside everything green pale gold. breakfast, ate alone, made ready say farewell, nearly heavy heart possible morning: cool, bright, clean washed autumn sky thin blue. air fresh Northwest. quiet ponies almost frisky, sniffing moving restlessly. Tom house waved hat danced upon doorstep, bidding hobbits get go good speed. rode along path wound away behind house, went slanting towards north end hill-brow sheltered. dismounted lead ponies last steep slope, suddenly Frodo stopped. ‘Goldberry!’ cried. ‘My fair lady, clad silver green! never farewell her, seen since evening!’ distressed turned back; moment clear call rippling down. hill-brow stood beckoning them: hair flying loose, caught sun shone shimmered. light like glint water dewy grass flashed feet danced. hastened last slope, stood breathless beside her. bowed, wave arm bade look round; looked hill-top lands morning. clear far-seen veiled misty stood upon knoll Forest, seen rising pale green dark trees West. direction land rose wooded ridges, green, yellow, russet sun, beyond lay hidden valley Brandywine. South, line Withywindle, distant glint like pale glass Brandywine River made great loop lowlands flowed away knowledge hobbits. Northward beyond dwindling downs land ran away flats swellings grey green pale earth-colours, faded featureless shadowy distance. Eastward Barrow-downs rose, ridge behind ridge morning, vanished eyesight guess: guess blue remote white glimmer blending hem sky, spoke them, memory old tales, high distant mountains. took deep draught air, felt skip stout strides bear wherever wished. seemed fainthearted go jogging aside crumpled skirts downs towards Road, leaping, lusty Tom, stepping stones hills straight towards Mountains. Goldberry spoke recalled eyes thoughts. ‘Speed now, fair guests!’ said. ‘And hold purpose! North wind left eye blessing footsteps!

Tom Bombadil’s house valley, Forest lost view. air grew warmer green walls hillside hillside, scent turf rose strong sweet breathed. Turning back, reached bottom green hollow, saw Goldberry, small slender like sunlit flower sky: standing watching them, hands stretched towards them. looked gave clear call, lifting hand turned vanished behind hill. way wound along floor hollow, round green feet steep hill another deeper broader valley, shoulders hills, long limbs, smooth sides again, new hill-tops new valleys. tree visible water: country grass short springy turf, silent except whisper air edges land, high lonely cries strange birds. journeyed sun mounted, grew hot. time climbed ridge breeze seemed grown less. caught glimpse country westward distant Forest seemed smoking, fallen rain steaming leaf root mould. shadow lay round edge sight, dark haze upper sky like blue cap, hot heavy. mid-day hill whose top wide flattened, like shallow saucer green mounded rim. Inside air stirring, sky seemed near heads. rode across looked northwards. hearts rose; seemed plain already expected. Certainly distances become hazy deceptive, doubt Downs coming end. long valley lay winding away northwards, opening two steep shoulders. Beyond, seemed hills. Due north faintly glimpsed long dark line. ‘That line trees,’ Merry, ‘and must mark Road. along leagues east Bridge trees growing. say planted old days.’ ‘Splendid!’ Frodo. ‘If make good going afternoon done morning, shall left Downs Sun sets jogging search camping place.’ even spoke turned glance eastwards, saw side hills higher looked upon them; hills crowned green mounds, standing stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth green gums. view somehow disquieting; turned sight went hollow circle. midst stood single stone, standing tall sun above, hour casting shadow. shapeless yet significant: like landmark, guarding finger, like warning. hungry, sun fearless noon; set backs east side stone. cool, sun power warm it; time seemed pleasant. took food drink, made good noonmeal open sky anyone wish; food ‘down Hill’. Tom provided plenty comfort day. ponies unburdened strayed upon grass. Riding hills, eating fill, warm sun scent turf, lying little long, stretching legs looking sky noses: things are, perhaps, enough explain happened. However may be: woke suddenly uncomfortably sleep never meant take. standing stone cold, cast long pale shadow stretched eastward them. sun, pale watery yellow, gleaming mist west wall hollow lay; north, south, east, beyond wall fog thick, cold white. air silent, heavy chill. ponies standing crowded together heads down. hobbits sprang feet alarm, ran western rim. found upon island fog.

Suddenly Frodo saw hopeful sign. either side ahead darkness began loom mist; guessed last approaching gap hills, north-gate Barrow-downs. pass that, free. ‘Come on! Follow me!’ called back shoulder, hurried forward. hope soon changed bewilderment alarm. dark patches grew darker, shrank; suddenly saw, towering ominous leaning slightly towards one another like pillars headless door, two huge standing stones. remember seen sign valley, looked hill morning. passed almost aware: even darkness seemed fall round him. pony reared snorted, fell off. looked back found alone: others followed him. ‘Sam!’ called. ‘Pippin!

Frodo neither fat timid; indeed, though know it, Bilbo (and Gandalf) thought best hobbit Shire. thought end adventure, terrible end, thought hardened him. found stiffening, final spring; longer felt limp like helpless prey. lay there, thinking getting hold himself, noticed darkness slowly giving way: pale greenish light growing round him. first show kind place in, light seemed coming himself, floor beside him, yet reached roof wall. turned, cold glow saw lying beside Sam, Pippin, Merry. backs, faces looked deathly pale; clad white. lay treasures, gold maybe, though light looked cold unlovely. heads circlets, gold chains waists, fingers rings. Swords lay sides, shields feet. across three necks lay one long naked sword. * * * Suddenly song began: cold murmur, rising falling. voice seemed far away immeasurably dreary, sometimes high air thin, sometimes like low moan ground. formless stream sad horrible sounds, strings words shape themselves: grim, hard, cold words, heartless miserable. night railing morning bereaved, cold cursing warmth hungered. Frodo chilled marrow. song became clearer, dread heart perceived changed incantation: Cold hand heart bone, cold sleep stone: never wake stony bed, never, till Sun fails Moon dead. black wind stars shall die, gold let lie, till dark lord lifts hand dead sea withered land. heard behind head creaking scraping sound. Raising one arm looked, saw pale light kind passage behind turned corner. Round corner long arm groping, walking fingers towards Sam, lying nearest, towards hilt sword lay upon him. first Frodo felt indeed turned stone incantation. wild thought escape him. wondered put Ring, whether Barrow-wight miss him, might find way out. thought running free grass, grieving Merry, Sam, Pippin, free alive himself. Gandalf admit nothing else do. courage awakened strong: leave friends easily. wavered, groping pocket, fought again; arm crept nearer. Suddenly resolve hardened him, seized short sword lay beside him, kneeling stooped low bodies companions. strength hewed crawling arm near wrist, hand broke off; moment sword splintered hilt. shriek light vanished. dark snarling noise. Frodo fell forward Merry, Merry’s face felt cold. back mind, disappeared first coming fog, memory house Hill, Tom singing. remembered rhyme Tom taught them. small desperate voice began: Ho! Tom Bombadil! name voice seemed grow strong: full lively sound, dark chamber echoed drum trumpet. Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! water, wood hill, reed willow, fire, sun moon, harken hear us! Come, Tom Bombadil, need near us! sudden deep silence, Frodo hear heart beating. long slow moment heard plain, far away, coming ground thick walls, answering voice singing: Old Tom Bombadil merry fellow, Bright blue jacket is, boots yellow. None ever caught yet, Tom, master: songs stronger songs, feet faster. loud rumbling sound, stones rolling falling, suddenly light streamed in, real light, plain light day. low door-like opening appeared end chamber beyond Frodo’s feet; Tom’s head (hat, feather, all) framed light sun rising red behind him. light fell upon floor, upon faces three hobbits lying beside Frodo. stir, sickly hue left them. looked deeply asleep. Tom stooped, removed hat, dark chamber, singing: Get out, old Wight! Vanish sunlight! Shrivel like cold mist, like winds go wailing, barren lands far beyond mountains! never again! Leave barrow empty! Lost forgotten be, darker darkness, gates stand ever shut, till world mended. words cry part inner end chamber fell crash. long trailing shriek, fading away unguessable distance; silence. ‘Come, friend Frodo!’ Tom. ‘Let us get clean grass! must help bear them.’ Together carried Merry, Pippin, Sam. Frodo left barrow last time thought saw severed hand wriggling still, like wounded spider, heap fallen earth. Tom went back again, sound much thumping stamping. bearing arms great load treasure: things gold, silver, copper, bronze; beads chains jewelled ornaments. climbed green barrow laid top sunshine. stood, hat hand wind hair, looked upon three hobbits, laid backs upon grass west side mound. Raising right hand clear commanding voice: Wake merry lads! Wake hear calling! Warm heart limb! cold stone fallen; Dark door standing wide; dead hand broken. Night Night flown, Gate open! Frodo’s great joy hobbits stirred, stretched arms, rubbed eyes, suddenly sprang up. looked amazement, first Frodo, Tom standing large life barrow-top them; thin white rags, crowned belted pale gold, jingling trinkets. ‘What name wonder?’ began Merry, feeling golden circlet slipped one eye. stopped, shadow face, closed eyes. ‘Of course, remember!’ said. ‘The men Carn Duˆm us night, worsted.

Let us go on!’ ‘Dressed like this, sir?’ Sam. ‘Where clothes?’ flung circlet, belt, rings grass, looked round helplessly, expected find cloak, jacket, breeches, hobbit-garments lying somewhere hand. ‘You won’t find clothes again,’ Tom, bounding mound, laughing danced round sunlight. One thought nothing dangerous dreadful happened; indeed horror faded hearts looked him, saw merry glint eyes. ‘What mean?’ asked Pippin, looking him, half puzzled half amused. ‘Why not?’ Tom shook head, saying: ‘You’ve found again, deep water. Clothes little loss, escape drowning. glad, merry friends, let warm sunlight heat heart limb! Cast cold rags! Run naked grass, Tom goes a-hunting!’ sprang away hill, whistling calling. Looking Frodo saw running away southwards along green hollow hill next, whistling crying: Hey! now! hoy now! Whither wander? Up, down, near far, here, yonder? Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail Bumpkin, White-socks little lad, old Fatty Lumpkin! sang, running fast, tossing hat catching it, hidden fold ground: time hey now! hoy now! floating back wind, shifted round towards south. air growing warm again. hobbits ran grass, told them. lay basking sun delight wafted suddenly bitter winter friendly clime, people that, long ill bedridden, wake one day find unexpectedly well day full promise. time Tom returned feeling strong (and hungry). reappeared, hat first, brow hill, behind obedient line six ponies: five one more. last plainly old Fatty Lumpkin: larger, stronger, fatter (and older) ponies.

Tom bowed hobbits. ‘Here ponies, now!’ said. ‘They’ve sense (in ways) wandering hobbits – sense noses. sniff danger ahead walk right into; run save themselves, run right way. must forgive all; though hearts faithful, face fear Barrow-wights made for. See, again, bringing burdens!’ Merry, Sam, Pippin clothed spare garments packs; soon felt hot, obliged put thicker warmer things brought oncoming winter. ‘Where old animal, Fatty Lumpkin, from?’ asked Frodo. ‘He’s mine,’ Tom. ‘My four-legged friend; though seldom ride him, wanders often far, free upon hillsides. ponies stayed me, got know Lumpkin; smelt night, quickly ran meet him. thought he’d look words wisdom take fear away. now, jolly Lumpkin, old Tom’s going ride.
