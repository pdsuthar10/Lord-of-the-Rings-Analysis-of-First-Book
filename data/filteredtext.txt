 J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord Rings often erroneously called trilogy, fact single novel, consisting six books plus appendices, sometimes published three volumes. The first volume, The Fellowship Ring, published Great Britain London firm George Allen & Unwin 29 July 1954; American edition followed 21 October year, published Houghton Mifflin Company Boston. In production first volume, Tolkien experienced became continual problem: printer’s errors compositor’s mistakes, including wellintentioned ‘corrections’ sometimes idiosyncratic usage. These ‘corrections’ include altering dwarves dwarfs, elvish elfish, farther, nasturtians nasturtiums, try say try say (‘worst all’ Tolkien) elven elfin. In work The Lord Rings, containing invented languages delicately constructed nomenclatures, errors inconsistencies impede understanding appreciation serious readers – Tolkien many readers early on. Even publication third volume, contained much hitherto unrevealed information invented languages writing systems, Tolkien received many letters readers written systems, addition numerous enquiries finer points usage. The second volume, The Two Towers, published England 11 November 1954 United States 21 April 1955. Meanwhile Tolkien worked keep promise made foreword volume one: ‘an index names strange words’ would appear third volume. As originally planned, index would contain much etymological information languages, particularly elven tongues, large vocabulary. It proved chief cause delay publishing volume three, end contained index all, apology publisher absence. For Tolkien abandoned work indexing volumes one two, believing size therefore cost ruinous. Volume three, The Return King, finally appeared England 20 October 1955 United States 5 January 1956. With appearance third volume, The Lord Rings published entirety, first edition text remained virtually unchanged decade. Tolkien made small corrections, errors entered The Fellowship Ring December 1954 second impression printer, distributed type first printing, reset book without informing author publisher. These include misrepresentations original printed text – is, words phrases read acceptably context, depart Tolkien’s wording originally written published. In 1965, stemming appeared copyright problems United States, American paperback firm published unauthorized non-royalty-paying edition The Lord Rings. For new edition Ace Books text narrative reset, thus introducing new typographical errors; appendices, however, reproduced photographically hardcover edition, remain consistent it. Tolkien set work first revision text newly revised authorized edition could successfully compete American market. This first revision text published America paperback Ballantine Books, licence Houghton Mifflin, October 1965. In addition revisions within text itself, Tolkien replaced original foreword new one. He pleased remove original foreword; check copy, wrote it: ‘confusing (as does) real personal matters ‘‘machinery’’ Tale, serious mistake’. Tolkien also added extension prologue index – detailed index names promised first edition, but, rather, bald index names page references. Additionally, time appendices greatly revised. Tolkien received copies Ballantine edition late January 1966, early February recorded diary ‘worked hours Appendices Ballantine version & found errors I first expected’. Soon sent small number revisions Ballantine appendices, including well-known addition ‘Estella Bolger’ wife Meriadoc family trees Appendix C. Most revisions, entered variously third fourth impressions (June August 1966) volume three, always inserted correctly (thereby causing confusion text), somehow never made main sequence revision three-volume British hardcover edition, long remained anomalies. Tolkien wrote, concerning revising The Lord Rings, perhaps failed keep notes order; errant branch revision seems likely example disorder – either notes ability publishers follow utmost accuracy. The revised text first appeared Great Britain threevolume hardcover ‘Second Edition’ Allen & Unwin 27 October 1966. But problems. Although revisions Tolkien sent America text available utilized new British edition, extensive revisions appendices lost entered Ballantine edition. Allen & Unwin forced reset appendices using copy published first Ballantine edition. This include Tolkien’s second, small set revisions sent Ballantine; but, significantly, include great number errors omissions, many discovered long afterwards. Thus, appendices, close scrutiny first edition text much later corrected impressions second edition necessary discern whether particular change edition authorial erroneous. In America, revised text appeared hardcover three-volume edition published Houghton Mifflin 27 February 1967. This text evidently photo-offset 1966 Allen & Unwin three-volume hardcover, thus consistent it. Aside first printing second Houghton Mifflin edition, 1967 date title page, none many reprintings dated. After initial printings edition, bore 1966 copyright notice, date copyright changed 1965 match statement Ballantine edition. This change caused great deal confusion librarians researchers tried sort sequence publication editions. Meanwhile, Tolkien spent much summer 1966 revising text. In June learned revisions late inclusion 1966 Allen & Unwin second edition, recorded diary: ‘But I attempting complete work [on revisions] – I cannot leave mind. So much time wasted work constant breaking threads.’ This last major set revisions Tolkien made text lifetime. They added second impression (1967) three-volume hardcover Allen & Unwin second edition. The revisions mostly include corrections nomenclature attempts consistency usage throughout three volumes. Some small alterations made Tolkien 1969 one-volume India paper edition. J.R.R. Tolkien died 1973. His third son literary executor, Christopher Tolkien, sent large number corrections misprints, mainly appendices index, Allen & Unwin use editions 1974. Most corrections typographical, line father’s expressed intent check copies. Since 1974, Christopher Tolkien sent additional corrections, errors discovered, British publishers The Lord Rings (Allen & Unwin, later Unwin Hyman, HarperCollins), tried conscientious impossible task maintaining textual integrity whichever editions The Lord Rings published. However, every time text reset publication new format (e.g. various paperback editions published England 1970s 1980s), huge numbers new misprints crept in, though times errors observed corrected later printings. Still, throughout years three-volume British hardcover edition retained highest textual integrity. In United States, text Ballantine paperback remained unchanged three decades Tolkien added revisions 1966. The text Houghton Mifflin editions remained unchanged 1967 1987, Houghton Mifflin photo-offset current three-volume British hardcover edition order update text used editions. In new reprintings number corrections (overseen Christopher Tolkien) added, errant Ballantine branch revision (including ‘Estella Bolger’ addition) integrated main branch textual descent. This method correction involved cut-and-paste process printed versions text. Beginning 1987 Houghton Mifflin edition, earlier version ‘Note Text’ (dated October 1986) added The Lord Rings. This ‘Note’ reworked three times since – version dated April 1993 first appeared 1994, version dated April 2002 came later year. The present ‘Note’ replaces supersedes previous versions. For 1994 British edition published HarperCollins, text The Lord Rings entered wordprocessing files. This next stage textual evolution came allow greater uniformity text future editions, it, inevitably, came new wrinkles. Some new misreadings entered text, time others fixed. In worst instance, one line ring inscription chapter ‘The Shadow Past’ The Fellowship Ring simply dropped. Unforeseeable glitches arose editions base computerized text transferred page-making typesetting programs – e.g., one edition The Fellowship Ring, closing two sentences ‘The Council Elrond’ simply inexplicably disappeared. Such glitches much exception, rule, text otherwise maintained consistency integrity throughout computerized evolution. The 1994 edition also contained number new corrections (again supervised Christopher Tolkien), well reconfigured index names page references. The 1994 text first used American editions published Houghton Mifflin 1999. A small number corrections added 2002 three-volume edition illustrated Alan Lee, published HarperCollins Great Britain Houghton Mifflin United States. The textual history The Lord Rings, merely published form, vast complex web. In brief note I given glimpse overall sequence structure. Further details revisions corrections made years published text The Lord Rings, fuller account publishing history, may found J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography, Wayne G. Hammond, assistance Douglas A. Anderson (1993). For interested observing gradual evolving The Lord Rings earliest drafts published form, I highly recommend Christopher Tolkien’s account, appears within five volumes twelve-volume series The History Middle-earth. Volumes six nine contain major part study pertaining The Lord Rings: The Return Shadow (1988); The Treason Isengard (1989); The War Ring (1990); Sauron Defeated (1992). Also, final book series, The Peoples Middle-earth (1996), covers evolution prologue appendices The Lord Rings. These volumes contain engrossing over-the-shoulder account growth writing Tolkien’s masterpiece. The process studying Tolkien’s manuscripts The Lord Rings involved deciphering versions Tolkien wrote first pencil ink atop pencilled draft. Christopher Tolkien decribed father’s method composition The Return Shadow: ‘In handwriting used rapid drafts sketches, intended endure long turned gave workable form, letters loosely formed word cannot deduced guessed context later versions prove perfectly opaque long examination; if, often did, used soft pencil much become blurred faint.’ The true difficulty reading double-drafts observed frontispiece The War Ring, reproduces colour Tolkien’s illustration ‘Shelob’s Lair’ page Tolkien’s manuscript. Looking closely hasty ink draft alongside illustration, one see underneath earlier, hastier, pencilled draft. Also The War Ring, Christopher Tolkien reproduces page first manuscript chapter ‘The Taming Sme´agol’, printed text corresponding text facing page (see pp. 90–91). One astonished anyone’s ability decipher texts. That difficulty aside, books signify ordinary readers Tolkien scholars? And ‘the history writing’ book? Simply, volumes show great detail development story The Lord Rings earliest drafts hasty projections completion. We see earliest materials much children’s book, sequel The Hobbit, story grows various ‘phases’, increase seriousness depth. We see alternate branches development, gradual blending merging certain characters, slow emergence nature rings motivations characters. Some various ideas abandoned altogether, others reworked variant form may may survive final version. One could make whole catalogue interesting tidbits Christopher Tolkien’s study – fact Strider called Trotter late stage writing book; Trotter one time hobbit, named wore wooden shoes; Tolkien one point considered romance Aragorn E´owyn; Tolkien wrote epilogue book, tying loose ends, dropped publication (and appears Sauron Defeated); on. But developments best appreciated read within context Christopher Tolkien’s commentary rather discussed separately. The significant achievement volumes show us Tolkien wrote thought. Nowhere else see authorial process work detail. Tolkien’s hastiest comments story might proceed, can’t go way – queries written out: Tolkien literally thinking paper. This gives added dimension understanding Tolkien’s comment Stanley Unwin 1963 letter that, suffering trouble shoulder right arm, ‘I found able use pen pencil defeating loss beak would hen.’ And we, readers volumes, share Tolkien wonder bewilderment new characters appearing nowhere, sudden change development, moment emergence story. I know instance literature ‘history writing’ book, told mostly author himself, hesitations false paths laid us, sorted out, commented upon, served reader like feast. We shown innumerable instances minutest detail thought-process work. We see author fully absorbed creation sake. And exceptional history unfolding story text, evolution world. There additional wealth material beyond simple narrative text. There maps illustrations. There languages writing systems, histories peoples spoke wrote systems. All additional materials add multiple dimensions complexity appreciation invented world itself. Fifty years published life The Lord Rings, seems extraordinary masterful work literature also companion unparalleled account writing. Our gratitude readers goes Tolkiens, father son. Douglas A. Anderson May 2004 NOTE ON THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION In edition The Lord Rings, prepared fiftieth anniversary publication, three four hundred emendations made following exhaustive review past editions printings. The present text based setting HarperCollins three-volume hardcover edition 2002, turn revision HarperCollins reset edition 1994. As Douglas A. Anderson comments preceding ‘Note Text’, editions corrected, also introduced new errors. At time, errors survived undetected, among five dozen entered long ago 1954, resetting The Fellowship Ring published ‘second impression’. That printer quietly reset The Fellowship Ring, copies issued without proof read author, never became known Tolkien; publisher, Rayner Unwin, learned thirtyeight years fact. Tolkien found unauthorized changes introduced second printing (probably preparing second edition 1965) read copy twelfth impression (1962), thought errors newly made. These, among others, corrected course reprinting. Then 1992 Eric Thompson, reader keen eye typographic detail, noticed small differences first second impressions The Fellowship Ring called attention present editors. About one-sixth errors entered second printing quickly came light. Many revealed recently, Steven M. Frisby used ingenious optical aids make comparison copies The Lord Rings greater detail previously accomplished. We gladly made full use Mr Frisby’s results, generously shared discussed. In course fifty-year history The Lord Rings many readers recorded changes made various appearances print, document gone aid achievement authoritative text. Errors possible errors reported author publishers, information textual history work circulated among Tolkien enthusiasts least early 1966, Banks Mebane published ‘Prolegomena Variorum Tolkien’ fanzine Entmoot. Most notably later years, Douglas A. Anderson forefront efforts achieve accurate text The Lord Rings (and The Hobbit); Christina Scull published ‘A Preliminary Study Variations Editions The Lord Rings’ Beyond Bree (April August 1985); Wayne G. Hammond compiled extensive lists textual changes J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography (1993); David Bratman published important article, ‘A Corrigenda The Lord Rings’, March 1994 number The Tolkien Collector. The observations Dainis Bisenieks, Yuval Welis, Charles Noad, readers, sent us directly posted public forums, also service. Efforts follow example author The Lord Rings lifetime. His concern textual accuracy coherence work evident many emendations made later printings, notes made emendations one reason another previously (or partly) put effect. Even late life, labours wearied him, feelings clear. On 30 October 1967 wrote Joy Hill George Allen & Unwin, concerning reader’s query received points Appendices The Lord Rings: ‘Personally I ceased bother minor ‘‘discrepancies’’, since genealogies calendars etc. lack verisimilitude general excessive accuracy: compared real annals genealogies! Anyway slips few, mostly removed, discovery remain seems amusing pastime! But errors text another matter’ (italics ours). In fact Tolkien ‘ceased bother’, ‘slips’ dealt opportunities arose. These, indulgence publisher, allowed Tolkien luxury authors enjoy: multiple chances correct text improve it, develop languages, geography, peoples Middle-earth. The fiftieth anniversary The Lord Rings seemed ideal opportunity consider latest (2002) text light information gathered course decades work Tolkien studies, Steve Frisby’s research hand, electronic copy The Lord Rings (supplied HarperCollins) searchable keyword phrase. The latter especially allowed us develop lists words varied one instance another, investigate variations usage, stood copy-text relative earlier editions printings. Of course Tolkien wrote The Lord Rings long period time, eighteen years, inconsistencies text almost inevitable. Christopher Tolkien even observed us apparent inconsistencies form father’s work may even deliberate: instance, although Tolkien carefully distinguished house ‘dwelling’ House ‘noble family dynasty’, two instances used house latter sense lower case, perhaps capital letter would detracted importance adjective word paired (‘royal house’, ‘golden house’). There doubt, however, Tolkien attempted correct inconsistency, less outright error, whenever came attention, opinion, advice agreement Christopher Tolkien, attempt made anniversary edition, far could carefully conservatively distinguish emend. Many emendations present text marks punctuation, either correct recent typographical errors repair surviving alterations introduced second printing The Fellowship Ring. In latter respect every case, Tolkien’s original punctuation always felicitous – subtle points, one comparing commas semi-colons, less part author’s intended expression. Distinctive words chill rather cold, glistered rather glistened, changed typesetters long ago without authorization, likewise restored. A controlled amount regularization also seemed called for, naught rather nought, change instituted Tolkien carried instances; Dark Power rather dark power reference obviouslytoSauron(orMorgoth);Barrow-downsbyTolkien’s preference rather Barrowdowns; likewise Bree-hill rather Bree Hill; accented common Dru´adan rather Druadan; capitalized names seasons used personification metaphor, according Tolkien’s predominant practice internal logic text; Elvish rather elvish used separate adjective, following preference Tolkien marked copy second edition The Lord Rings. In addition, added second accent Nu´meno´rean(s), Tolkien often wrote name manuscript appears The Silmarillion posthumous publications. The result, nonetheless, still includes many variations capitalization, punctuation, points style. Not erroneous: include words Sun, Moon, Hobbit, Man (or sun, moon, hobbit, man), may change form according meaning application, relation adjacent adjectives, whether Tolkien intended personification, poetry, emphasis. His intent cannot divined confidence every case. But possible discern Tolkien’s preferences many instances, statements wrote check copies The Lord Rings close analysis text manuscript, typescript, proof, print. Whenever doubt whatsoever author’s intentions, text allowed stand. Most demonstrable errors noted Christopher Tolkien The History Middle-earth also corrected, distance Brandywine Bridge Ferry (ten miles rather twenty) number Merry’s ponies (five rather six), shadows earlier drafts. But inconsistencies content, Gimli’s famous (and erroneous) statement Book III, Chapter 7, ‘Till I hewn naught wood since I left Moria’, would require rewriting emend rather simple correction, remain unchanged. So many new emendations The Lord Rings, extensive review text, deserve fully documented. Although readers content text alone, many want know problems encountered preparing new edition, solutions (where solutions possible), especially text emended, also not. To end, illuminate work respects, preparing volume annotations The Lord Rings publication 2005. This allow us discuss, length impossible prefatory note, various textual cruces The Lord Rings, identify changes made present text, remark significant alterations published work throughout history. We also explain archaic unusual words names The Lord Rings, explore literary historical influences, note connections Tolkien’s writings, comment differences drafts published form, questions language, much else hope interest readers enhance enjoyment Tolkien’s masterpiece. Wayne G. Hammond & Christina Scull May 2004 FOREWORD TO THE SECOND EDITION This tale grew telling, became history Great War Ring included many glimpses yet ancient history preceded it. It begun soon The Hobbit written publication 1937; I go sequel, I wished first complete set order mythology legends Elder Days, taking shape years. I desired satisfaction, I little hope people would interested work, especially since primarily linguistic inspiration begun order provide necessary background ‘history’ Elvish tongues. When whose advice opinion I sought corrected little hope hope, I went back sequel, encouraged requests readers information concerning hobbits adventures. But story drawn irresistibly towards older world, became account, were, end passing away beginning middle told. The process begun writing The Hobbit, already references older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, High-elves, orcs, well glimpses arisen unbidden things higher deeper darker surface: Durin, Moria, Gandalf, Necromancer, Ring. The discovery significance glimpses relation ancient histories revealed Third Age culmination War Ring. Those asked information hobbits eventually got it, wait long time; composition The Lord Rings went intervals years 1936 1949, period I many duties I neglect, many interests learner teacher often absorbed me. The delay was, course, also increased outbreak war 1939, end year tale yet reached end Book One. In spite darkness next five years I found story could wholly abandoned, I plodded on, mostly night, till I stood Balin’s tomb Moria. There I halted long while. It almost year later I went came Lothlo´rien Great River late 1941. In next year I wrote first drafts matter stands Book Three, beginnings chapters I III Book Five; beacons flared Ano´rien The´oden came Harrowdale I stopped. Foresight failed time thought. It 1944 that, leaving loose ends perplexities war task conduct, least report, I forced tackle journey Frodo Mordor. These chapters, eventually become Book Four, written sent serial son, Christopher, South Africa RAF. Nonetheless took another five years tale brought present end; time I changed house, chair, college, days though less dark less laborious. Then ‘end’ last reached whole story revised, indeed largely re-written backwards. And typed, re-typed: me; cost professional typing ten-fingered beyond means. The Lord Rings read many people since finally appeared print; I like say something reference many opinions guesses I received read concerning motives meaning tale. The prime motive desire tale-teller try hand really long story would hold attention readers, amuse them, delight them, times maybe excite deeply move them. As guide I feelings appealing moving, many guide inevitably often fault. Some xxvii read book, rate reviewed it, found boring, absurd, contemptible; I cause complain, since I similar opinions works, kinds writing evidently prefer. But even points view many enjoyed story much fails please. It perhaps possible long tale please everybody points, displease everybody points; I find letters I received passages chapters blemish others specially approved. The critical reader all, myself, finds many defects, minor major, fortunately obligation either review book write again, pass silence, except one noted others: book short. As inner meaning ‘message’, intention author none. It neither allegorical topical. As story grew put roots (into past) threw unexpected branches: main theme settled outset inevitable choice Ring link The Hobbit. The crucial chapter, ‘The Shadow Past’, one oldest parts tale. It written long foreshadow 1939 yet become threat inevitable disaster, point story would developed along essentially lines, disaster averted. Its sources things long mind, cases already written, little nothing modified war began 1939 sequels. The real war resemble legendary war process conclusion. If inspired directed development legend, certainly Ring would seized used Sauron; would annihilated enslaved, Barad-duˆr would destroyed occupied. Saruman, failing get possession Ring, would confusion treacheries time found Mordor missing links researches Ring-lore, long would made Great Ring challenge self-styled Ruler Middle-earth. In conflict sides would held hobbits hatred contempt: would long survived even slaves. Other arrangements could devised according tastes views like allegory topical reference. But I cordially dislike allegory manifestations, always done since I grew old wary enough detect presence. I much prefer history, true feigned, varied applicability thought experience readers. I think many confuse ‘applicability’ ‘allegory’; one resides freedom reader, purposed domination author. An author cannot course remain wholly unaffected experience, ways story-germ uses soil experience extremely complex, attempts define process best guesses evidence inadequate ambiguous. It also false, though naturally attractive, lives author critic overlapped, suppose movements thought events times common necessarily powerful influences. One indeed personally come shadow war feel fully oppression; years go seems often forgotten caught youth 1914 less hideous experience involved 1939 following years. By 1918 one close friends dead. Or take less grievous matter: supposed ‘The Scouring Shire’ reflects situation England time I finishing tale. It not. It essential part plot, foreseen outset, though event modified character Saruman developed story without, need I say, allegorical significance contemporary political reference whatsoever. It indeed basis experience, though slender (for economic situation entirely different), much back. The xxix country I lived childhood shabbily destroyed I ten, days motor-cars rare objects (I never seen one) men still building suburban railways. Recently I saw paper picture last decrepitude thriving corn-mill beside pool long ago seemed important. I never liked looks Young miller, father, Old miller, black beard, named Sandyman. The Lord Rings issued new edition, opportunity taken revising it. A number errors inconsistencies still remained text corrected, attempt made provide information points attentive readers raised. I considered comments enquiries, seem passed may I failed keep notes order; many enquiries could answered additional appendices, indeed production accessory volume containing much material I include original edition, particular detailed linguistic information. In meantime edition offers Foreword, addition Prologue, notes, index names persons places. This index intention complete items references, since present purpose necessary reduce bulk. A complete index, making full use material prepared Mrs. N. Smith, belongs rather accessory volume. . PROLOGUE 1 Concerning Hobbits This book largely concerned Hobbits, pages reader may discover much character little history. Further information also found selection Red Book Westmarch already published, title The Hobbit. That story derived earlier chapters Red Book, composed Bilbo himself, first Hobbit become famous world large, called There Back Again, since told journey East return: adventure later involved Hobbits great events Age related. Many, however, may wish know remarkable people outset, may possess earlier book. For readers notes important points collected Hobbit-lore, first adventure briefly recalled. Hobbits unobtrusive ancient people, numerous formerly today; love peace quiet good tilled earth: well-ordered wellfarmed countryside favourite haunt. They understand like machines complicated forge-bellows, water-mill, hand-loom, though skilful tools. Even ancient days were, rule, shy ‘the Big Folk’, call us, avoid us dismay becoming hard find. They quick hearing sharp-eyed, though inclined fat hurry unnecessarily, nonetheless nimble deft movements. They possessed first art disappearing swiftly silently, large folk wish meet come blundering by; art developed Men may seem magical. But Hobbits never, fact, studied magic kind, elusiveness due solely professional skill heredity practice, close friendship earth, rendered inimitable bigger clumsier races. For little people, smaller Dwarves: less stout stocky, is, even actually much shorter. Their height variable, ranging two four feet measure. They seldom reach three feet; dwindled, say, ancient days taller. According Red Book, Bandobras Took (Bullroarer), son Isumbras Third, four foot five able ride horse. He surpassed Hobbit records two famous characters old; curious matter dealt book. As Hobbits Shire, tales concerned, days peace prosperity merry folk. They dressed bright colours, notably fond yellow green; seldom wore shoes, since feet tough leathery soles clad thick curling hair, much like hair heads, commonly brown. Thus, craft little practised among shoe-making; long skilful fingers could make many useful comely things. Their faces rule good-natured rather beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked, mouths apt laughter, eating drinking. And laugh did, eat, drink, often heartily, fond simple jests times, six meals day (when could get them). They hospitable delighted parties, presents, gave away freely eagerly accepted. It plain indeed spite later estrangement Hobbits relatives ours: far nearer us Elves, even Dwarves. Of old spoke languages Men, fashion, liked disliked much things Men did. But exactly relationship longer discovered. The beginning Hobbits lies far back Elder Days lost forgotten. Only Elves still preserve records vanished time, traditions concerned almost entirely history, Men appear seldom Hobbits mentioned all. Yet clear Hobbits had, fact, lived quietly Middle-earth many long years folk became even aware them. And world full strange creatures beyond count, little people seemed little importance. But days Bilbo, Frodo heir, suddenly became, wish own, important renowned, troubled counsels Wise Great. Those days, Third Age Middle-earth, long past, shape lands changed; regions Hobbits lived doubtless still linger: North-West Old World, east Sea. Of original home Hobbits Bilbo’s time preserved knowledge. A love learning (other genealogical lore) far general among them, remained still older families studied books, even gathered reports old times distant lands Elves, Dwarves, Men. Their records began settlement Shire, ancient legends hardly looked back Wandering Days. It clear, nonetheless, legends, evidence peculiar words customs, like many folk Hobbits distant past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem glimpse time dwelt upper vales Anduin, eaves Greenwood Great Misty Mountains. Why later undertook hard perilous crossing mountains Eriador longer certain. Their accounts speak multiplying Men land, shadow fell forest, became darkened new name Mirkwood. Before crossing mountains Hobbits already become divided three somewhat different breeds: Harfoots, Stoors, Fallohides. The Harfoots browner skin, smaller, shorter, beardless bootless; hands feet neat nimble; preferred highlands hillsides. The Stoors broader, heavier build; feet hands larger; preferred flat lands riversides. The Fallohides fairer skin also hair, taller slimmer others; lovers trees woodlands. The Harfoots much Dwarves ancient times, long lived foothills mountains. They moved westward early, roamed Eriador far Weathertop others still Wilderland. They normal representative variety Hobbit, far numerous. They inclined settle one place, longest preserved ancestral habit living tunnels holes. The Stoors lingered long banks Great River Anduin, less shy Men. They came west Harfoots followed course Loudwater southwards; many long dwelt Tharbad borders Dunland moved north again. The Fallohides, least numerous, northerly branch. They friendly Elves Hobbits were, skill language song handicrafts; old preferred hunting tilling. They crossed mountains north Rivendell came River Hoarwell. In Eriador soon mingled kinds preceded them, somewhat bolder adventurous, often found leaders chieftains among clans Harfoots Stoors. Even Bilbo’s time strong Fallohidish strain could still noted among greater families, Tooks Masters Buckland. In westlands Eriador, Misty Mountains Mountains Lune, Hobbits found Men Elves. Indeed, remnant still dwelt Du´nedain, kings Men came Sea Westernesse; dwindling fast lands North Kingdom falling far wide waste. There room spare incomers, ere long Hobbits began settle ordered communities. Most earlier settlements long disappeared forgotten Bilbo’s time; one first become important still endured, though reduced size; Bree Chetwood lay round about, forty miles east Shire. It early days, doubtless, Hobbits learned letters began write manner Du´nedain, turn long learned art Elves. And days also forgot whatever languages used before, spoke ever Common Speech, Westron named, current lands kings Arnor Gondor, coasts Sea Belfalas Lune. Yet kept words own, well names months days, great store personal names past. About time legend among Hobbits first becomes history reckoning years. For one thousand six hundred first year Third Age Fallohide brothers, Marcho Blanco, set Bree; obtained permission high king Fornost,* crossed brown river Baranduin great following Hobbits. They passed Bridge Stonebows, built days power North Kingdom, took land beyond dwell in, river Far Downs.

Thus began Shire-reckoning, year crossing Brandywine (as Hobbits turned name) became Year One Shire, later dates reckoned it.* At western Hobbits fell love new land, remained there, soon passed history Men Elves. While still king name subjects, were, fact, ruled chieftains meddled events world outside. To last battle Fornost Witch-lord Angmar sent bowmen aid king, maintained, though tales Men record it. But war North Kingdom ended; Hobbits took land own, chose chiefs Thain hold authority king gone. There thousand years little troubled wars, prospered multiplied Dark Plague (S.R. 37) disaster Long Winter famine followed it. Many thousands perished, Days Dearth (1158–60) time tale long past Hobbits become accustomed plenty. The land rich kindly, though long deserted entered it, well tilled, king many farms, cornlands, vineyards, woods. Forty leagues stretched Far Downs Brandywine Bridge, fifty northern moors marshes south. The Hobbits named Shire, region authority Thain, district well-ordered business; pleasant corner world plied well-ordered business living, * Thus, years Third Age reckoning Elves Du´nedain may found adding 1600 dates Shirereckoning. heeded less less world outside dark things moved, came think peace plenty rule Middle-earth right sensible folk. They forgot ignored little ever known Guardians, labours made possible long peace Shire. They were, fact, sheltered, ceased remember it. At time Hobbits kind warlike, never fought among themselves. In olden days had, course, often obliged fight maintain hard world; Bilbo’s time ancient history. The last battle, story opens, indeed one ever fought within borders Shire, beyond living memory: Battle Greenfields, S.R. 1147, Bandobras Took routed invasion Orcs. Even weathers grown milder, wolves come ravening North bitter white winters grandfather’s tale. So, though still store weapons Shire, used mostly trophies, hanging hearths walls, gathered museum Michel Delving. The Mathom-house called; anything Hobbits immediate use for, unwilling throw away, called mathom. Their dwellings apt become rather crowded mathoms, many presents passed hand hand sort. Nonetheless, ease peace left people still curiously tough. They were, came it, difficult daunt kill; were, perhaps, unwearyingly fond good things least could, put it, without them, could survive rough handling grief, foe, weather way astonished know well looked bellies well-fed faces. Though slow quarrel, sport killing nothing lived, doughty bay, need could still handle arms. They shot well bow, keen-eyed sure mark. Not bows arrows. If Hobbit stooped stone, well get quickly cover, trespassing beasts knew well. All Hobbits originally lived holes ground, believed, dwellings still felt home; course time obliged adopt forms abode. Actually Shire Bilbo’s days was, rule, richest poorest Hobbits maintained old custom. The poorest went living burrows primitive kind, mere holes indeed, one window none; well-to-do still constructed luxurious versions simple diggings old. But suitable sites large ramifying tunnels (or smials called them) everywhere found; flats low-lying districts Hobbits, multiplied, began build ground. Indeed, even hilly regions older villages, Hobbiton Tuckborough, chief township Shire, Michel Delving White Downs, many houses wood, brick, stone. These specially favoured millers, smiths, ropers, cartwrights, others sort; even holes live in, Hobbits long accustomed build sheds workshops. The habit building farmhouses barns said begun among inhabitants Marish Brandywine. The Hobbits quarter, Eastfarthing, rather large heavy-legged, wore dwarf-boots muddy weather. But well known Stoors large part blood, indeed shown many grew chins. No Harfoot Fallohide trace beard. Indeed, folk Marish, Buckland, east River, afterwards occupied, came part later Shire south-away; still many peculiar names strange words found elsewhere Shire. It probable craft building, many crafts beside, derived Du´nedain. But Hobbits may learned direct Elves, teachers Men youth. For Elves High Kindred yet forsaken Middle-earth, dwelt still time Grey Havens away west, places within reach Shire. Three Elf-towers immemorial age still seen Tower Hills beyond western marches. They shone far moonlight. The tallest furthest away, standing alone upon green mound. The Hobbits Westfarthing said one could see Sea top tower; Hobbit ever known climb it. Indeed, Hobbits ever seen sailed upon Sea, fewer still ever returned report it. Most Hobbits regarded even rivers small boats deep misgivings, many could swim. And days Shire lengthened spoke less less Elves, grew afraid them, distrustful dealings them; Sea became word fear among them, token death, turned faces away hills west. The craft building may come Elves Men, Hobbits used fashion. They go towers. Their houses usually long, low, comfortable. The oldest kind were, indeed, built imitations smials, thatched dry grass straw, roofed turves, walls somewhat bulged. That stage, however, belonged early days Shire, hobbit-building long since altered, improved devices, learned Dwarves, discovered themselves. A preference round windows, even round doors, chief remaining peculiarity hobbit-architecture. The houses holes Shire-hobbits often large, inhabited large families. (Bilbo Frodo Baggins bachelors exceptional, also many ways, friendship Elves.) Sometimes, case Tooks Great Smials, Brandybucks Brandy Hall, many generations relatives lived (comparative) peace together one ancestral many-tunnelled mansion. All Hobbits were, case, clannish reckoned relationships great care. They drew long elaborate family-trees innumerable branches. In dealing Hobbits important remember related whom, degree. It would impossible book set family-tree included even important members important families time tales tell of. The genealogical trees end Red Book Westmarch small book themselves, Hobbits would find exceedinglydull.Hobbitsdelightedinsuchthings,iftheywere accurate: liked books filled things already knew, set fair square contradictions. 2 Concerning Pipe-weed There another astonishing thing Hobbits old must mentioned, astonishing habit: imbibed inhaled, pipes clay wood, smoke burning leaves herb, called pipe-weed leaf, variety probably Nicotiana. A great deal mystery surrounds origin peculiar custom, ‘art’ Hobbits preferred call it. All could discovered antiquity put together Meriadoc Brandybuck (later Master Buckland), since tobacco Southfarthing play part history follows, remarks introduction Herblore Shire may quoted. ‘This,’ says, ‘is one art certainly claim invention. When Hobbits first began smoke known, legends family histories take granted; ages folk Shire smoked various herbs, fouler, sweeter. But accounts agree Tobold Hornblower Longbottom Southfarthing first grew true pipe-weed gardens days Isengrim Second, year 1070 Shire-reckoning. The best home-grown still comes district, especially varieties known Longbottom Leaf, Old Toby, Southern Star. ‘How Old Toby came plant recorded, dying day would tell. He knew much herbs, traveller. It said youth went often Bree, though certainly never went Shire that. It thus quite possible learned plant Bree, now, rate, grows well south slopes hill. The Bree-hobbits claim first actual smokers pipe-weed. They claim, course, done everything people Shire, refer ‘‘colonists’’; case claim is, I think, likely true. And certainly Bree art smoking genuine weed spread recent centuries among Dwarves folk, Rangers, Wizards, wanderers, still passed fro ancient road-meeting. The home centre art thus found old inn Bree, The Prancing Pony, kept family Butterbur time beyond record. ‘All same, observations I made many journeys south convinced weed native parts world, came northward lower Anduin, whither was, I suspect, originally brought Sea Men Westernesse. It grows abundantly Gondor, richer larger North, never found wild, flourishes warm sheltered places like Longbottom. The Men Gondor call sweet galenas, esteem fragrance flowers. From land must carried Greenway long centuries coming Elendil days. But even Du´nedain Gondor allow us credit: Hobbits first put pipes. Not even Wizards first thought did. Though one Wizard I knew took art long ago, became skilful things put mind to.’ 3 Of Ordering Shire The Shire divided four quarters, Farthings already referred to, North, South, East, West; number folklands, still bore names old leading families, although time history names longer found proper folklands. Nearly Tooks still lived Tookland, true many families, Bagginses Boffins. Outside Farthings East West Marches: Buckland (p. 129); Westmarch added Shire S.R. 1452. The Shire time hardly ‘government’. Families part managed affairs. Growing food eating occupied time. In matters were, rule, generous greedy, contented moderate, estates, farms, workshops, small trades tended remain unchanged generations. There remained, course, ancient tradition concerning high king Fornost, Norbury called it, away north Shire. But king nearly thousand years, even ruins Kings’ Norbury covered grass. Yet Hobbits still said wild folk wicked things (such trolls) heard king. For attributed king old essential laws; usually kept laws free will, The Rules (as said), ancient just. It true Took family long pre-eminent; office Thain passed (from Oldbucks) centuries before, chief Took borne title ever since. The Thain master Shiremoot, captain Shire-muster Hobbitry-inarms; muster moot held times emergency, longer occurred, Thainship ceased nominal dignity. The Took family still, indeed, accorded special respect, remained numerous exceedingly wealthy, liable produce every generation strong characters peculiar habits even adventurous temperament. The latter qualities, however, rather tolerated (in rich) generally approved. The custom endured, nonetheless, referring head family The Took, adding name, required, number: Isengrim Second, instance. The real official Shire date Mayor Michel Delving (or Shire), elected every seven years Free Fair White Downs Lithe, Midsummer. As mayor almost duty preside banquets, given Shire-holidays, occurred frequent intervals. But offices Postmaster First Shirriff attached mayoralty, managed Messenger Service Watch. These Shire-services, Messengers numerous, much busier two. By means Hobbits lettered, wrote constantly friends (and selection relations) lived afternoon’s walk. The Shirriffs name Hobbits gave police, nearest equivalent possessed. They had, course, uniforms (such things quite unknown), feather caps; practice rather haywards policemen, concerned strayings beasts people. There Shire twelve them, three Farthing, Inside Work. A rather larger body, varying need, employed ‘beat bounds’, see Outsiders kind, great small, make nuisance. At time story begins Bounders, called, greatly increased. There many reports complaints strange persons creatures prowling borders, them: first sign quite be, always except tales legends long ago. Few heeded sign, even Bilbo yet notion portended. Sixty years passed since set memorable journey, old even Hobbits, reached hundred often not; much evidently still remained considerable wealth brought back. How much little revealed one, even Frodo favourite ‘nephew’. And still kept secret ring found. 4 Of Finding Ring As told The Hobbit, came one day Bilbo’s door great Wizard, Gandalf Grey, thirteen dwarves him: none other, indeed, Thorin Oakenshield, descendant kings, twelve companions exile. With set out, lasting astonishment, morning April, year 1341 Shire-reckoning, quest great treasure, dwarf-hoards Kings Mountain, beneath Erebor Dale, far East. The quest successful, Dragon guarded hoard destroyed. Yet, though Battle Five Armies fought, Thorin slain, many deeds renown done, matter would scarcely concerned later history, earned note long annals Third Age, ‘accident’ way. The party assailed Orcs high pass Misty Mountains went towards Wilderland; happened Bilbo lost black orcmines deep mountains, there, groped vain dark, put hand ring, lying floor tunnel. He put pocket. It seemed like mere luck. Trying find way out, Bilbo went roots mountains, could go further. At bottom tunnel lay cold lake far light, island rock water lived Gollum. He loathsome little creature: paddled small boat large flat feet, peering pale luminous eyes catching blind fish long fingers, eating raw. He ate living thing, even orc, could catch strangle without struggle. He possessed secret treasure come long ages ago, still lived light: ring gold made wearer invisible. It one thing loved, ‘Precious’, talked it, even him. For kept hidden safe hole island, except hunting spying orcs mines. Maybe would attacked Bilbo once, ring met; not, hobbit held hand Elvish knife, served sword. So gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo Riddle-game, saying asked riddle Bilbo could guess, would kill eat him; Bilbo defeated him, would Bilbo wished: would lead way tunnels. Since lost dark without hope, could neither go back, Bilbo accepted challenge; asked one another many riddles. In end Bilbo game, luck (as seemed) wits; stumped last riddle ask, cried out, hand came upon ring picked forgotten: What I got pocket? This Gollum failed answer, though demanded three guesses. The Authorities, true, differ whether last question mere ‘question’ ‘riddle’ according strict rules Game; agree that, accepting trying guess answer, Gollum bound promise. And Bilbo pressed keep word; thought came slimy creature might prove false, even though promises held sacred, old wickedest things feared break them. But ages alone dark Gollum’s heart black, treachery it. He slipped away, returned island, Bilbo knew nothing, far dark water. There, thought, lay ring. He hungry now, angry, ‘Precious’ would fear weapon all. But ring island; lost it, gone. His screech sent shiver Bilbo’s back, though yet understand happened. But Gollum last leaped guess, late. What got pocketses? cried. The light eyes like green flame sped back murder hobbit recover ‘Precious’. Just time Bilbo saw peril, fled blindly passage away water; saved luck. For ran put hand pocket, ring slipped quietly finger. So Gollum passed without seeing him, went guard way out, lest ‘thief’ escape. Warily Bilbo followed him, went along, cursing, talking ‘Precious’; talk last even Bilbo guessed truth, hope came darkness: found marvellous ring chance escape orcs Gollum. At length came halt unseen opening led lower gates mines, eastward side mountains. There Gollum crouched bay, smelling listening; Bilbo tempted slay sword. But pity stayed him, though kept ring, hope lay, would use help kill wretched creature disadvantage. In end, gathering courage, leaped Gollum dark, fled away passage, pursued enemy’s cries hate despair: Thief, thief! Baggins! We hates ever! Now curious fact story Bilbo first told companions. To account Gollum promised give present, game; Gollum went fetch island found treasure gone: magic ring, given long ago birthday. Bilbo guessed ring found, game, already right. But tight place, said nothing it, made Gollum show way out, reward instead present. This account Bilbo set memoirs, seems never altered himself, even Council Elrond. Evidently still appeared original Red Book, several copies abstracts. But many copies contain true account (as alternative), derived doubt notes Frodo Samwise, learned truth, though seem unwilling delete anything actually written old hobbit himself. Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo’s first story, soon heard it, continued curious ring. Eventually got true tale Bilbo much questioning, strained friendship; wizard seemed think truth important. Though say Bilbo, also thought important, disturbing, find good hobbit told truth first: quite contrary habit. The idea ‘present’ mere hobbitlike invention, same. It suggested Bilbo, confessed, Gollum’s talk overheard; Gollum did, fact, call ring ‘birthday-present’, many times. That also Gandalf thought strange suspicious; discover truth point many years, seen book. Of Bilbo’s later adventures little need said here. With help ring escaped orc-guards gate rejoined companions. He used ring many times quest, chiefly help friends; kept secret long could. After return home never spoke anyone, save Gandalf Frodo; one else Shire knew existence, believed. Only Frodo show account Journey writing. His sword, Sting, Bilbo hung fireplace, coat marvellous mail, gift Dwarves Dragon-hoard, lent museum, Michel Delving Mathom-house fact. But kept drawer Bag End old cloak hood worn travels; ring, secured fine chain, remained pocket. He returned home Bag End June 22nd fifty-second year (S.R. 1342), nothing notable occurred Shire Mr. Baggins began preparations celebration hundred-and-eleventh birthday (S.R. 1401). At point History begins. note shire records At end Third Age part played Hobbits great events led inclusion Shire Reunited Kingdom awakened among widespread interest history; many traditions, time still mainly oral, collected written down. The greater families also concerned events Kingdom large, many members studied ancient histories legends. By end first century Fourth Age already found Shire several libraries contained many historical books records. The largest collections probably Undertowers, Great Smials, Brandy Hall. This account end Third Age drawn mainly Red Book Westmarch. That important source history War Ring called long preserved Undertowers, home Fairbairns, Wardens Westmarch.* It origin Bilbo’s private diary, took Rivendell. Frodo brought back Shire, together many loose leaves notes, S.R. 1420–1 nearly filled pages account War. But annexed preserved it, probably single red case, three large volumes, bound red leather, Bilbo gave parting gift. To four volumes added Westmarch fifth containing commentaries, genealogies, various matter concerning hobbit members Fellowship. The original Red Book preserved, many copies made, especially first volume, use descendants children Master Samwise. The important copy, however, different history. It kept Great Smials, written Gondor, probably request great-grandson Peregrin, completed S.R. 1592 (F.A. 172). Its southern scribe appended note: Findegil, King’s Writer, finished work IV 172. It exact copy details Thain’s Book Minas Tirith. That book copy, made request King Elessar, Red Book Periannath, brought Thain Peregrin retired Gondor IV 64. The Thain’s Book thus first copy made Red Book contained much later omitted lost. In Minas Tirith received much annotation, many corrections, especially names, words, quotations Elvish languages; added abbreviated version parts The Tale Aragorn Arwen lie outside account War. The full tale stated written Barahir, grandson Steward Faramir, time passing King. But chief importance Findegil’s copy alone contains whole Bilbo’s ‘Translations Elvish’.

Chapter 1 A LONG-EXPECTED PARTY When Mr. Bilbo Baggins Bag End announced would shortly celebrating eleventy-first birthday party special magnificence, much talk excitement Hobbiton. Bilbo rich peculiar, wonder Shire sixty years, ever since remarkable disappearance unexpected return. The riches brought back travels become local legend, popularly believed, whatever old folk might say, Hill Bag End full tunnels stuffed treasure. And enough fame, also prolonged vigour marvel at. Time wore on, seemed little effect Mr. Baggins. At ninety much fifty. At ninety-nine began call well-preserved; unchanged would nearer mark. There shook heads thought much good thing; seemed unfair anyone possess (apparently) perpetual youth well (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth. ‘It paid for,’ said. ‘It isn’t natural, trouble come it!’ But far trouble come; Mr. Baggins generous money, people willing forgive oddities good fortune. He remained visiting terms relatives (except, course, Sackville-Bagginses), many devoted admirers among hobbits poor unimportant families. But close friends, younger cousins began grow up. The eldest these, Bilbo’s favourite, young Frodo Baggins. When Bilbo ninety-nine adopted Frodo heir, brought live Bag End; hopes Sackville-Bagginses finally dashed. Bilbo Frodo happened birthday, September 22nd. ‘You better come live here, Frodo lad,’ said Bilbo one day; ‘and celebrate birthday-parties comfortably together.’ At time Frodo still tweens, hobbits called irresponsible twenties childhood coming age thirty-three. Twelve years passed. Each year Bagginses given lively combined birthday-parties Bag End; understood something quite exceptional planned autumn. Bilbo going eleventy-one, 111, rather curious number, respectable age hobbit (the Old Took reached 130); Frodo going thirty-three, 33, important number: date ‘coming age’. Tongues began wag Hobbiton Bywater; rumour coming event travelled Shire. The history character Mr. Bilbo Baggins became chief topic conversation; older folk suddenly found reminiscences welcome demand. No one attentive audience old Ham Gamgee, commonly known Gaffer. He held forth The Ivy Bush, small inn Bywater road; spoke authority, tended garden Bag End forty years, helped old Holman job that. Now growing old stiff joints, job mainly carried youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father son friendly terms Bilbo Frodo. They lived Hill itself, Number 3 Bagshot Row Bag End. ‘A nice well-spoken gentlehobbit Mr. Bilbo, I’ve always said,’ Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: Bilbo polite him, calling ‘Master Hamfast’, consulting constantly upon growing vegetables – matter ‘roots’, especially potatoes, Gaffer recognized leading authority neighbourhood (including himself). ‘But Frodo lives him?’ asked Old Noakes Bywater. ‘Baggins name, he’s half Brandybuck, say. It beats Baggins Hobbiton go looking wife away Buckland, folks queer.’ ‘And wonder they’re queer,’ put Daddy Twofoot (the Gaffer’s next-door neighbour), ‘if live wrong side Brandywine River, right agin Old Forest. That’s dark bad place, half tales true.’ ‘You’re right, Dad!’ said Gaffer. ‘Not Brandybucks Buckland live Old Forest; they’re queer breed, seemingly. They fool boats big river – isn’t natural. Small wonder trouble came it, I say. But may, Mr. Frodo nice young hobbit could wish meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, looks. After father Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit Mr. Drogo Baggins; never much tell him, till drownded.’ ‘Drownded?’ said several voices. They heard darker rumours before, course; hobbits passion family history, ready hear again. ‘Well, say,’ said Gaffer. ‘You see: Mr. Drogo, married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She Mr. Bilbo’s first cousin mother’s side (her mother youngest Old Took’s daughters); Mr. Drogo second cousin. So Mr. Frodo first second cousin, removed either way, saying is, follow me. And Mr. Drogo staying Brandy Hall father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, often marriage (him partial vittles, old Gorbadoc keeping mighty generous table); went boating Brandywine River; wife drownded, poor Mr. Frodo child all.’ ‘I’ve heard went water dinner moonlight,’ said Old Noakes; ‘and Drogo’s weight sunk boat.’ ‘And I heard pushed in, pulled him,’ said Sandyman, Hobbiton miller. ‘You shouldn’t listen hear, Sandyman,’ said Gaffer, much like miller. ‘There isn’t call go talking pushing pulling. Boats quite tricky enough sit still without looking cause trouble. Anyway: Mr. Frodo left orphan stranded, might say, among queer Bucklanders, brought anyhow Brandy Hall. A regular warren, accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never fewer couple hundred relations place. Mr. Bilbo never kinder deed brought lad back live among decent folk. ‘But I reckon nasty knock SackvilleBagginses. They thought going get Bag End, time went thought dead. And comes back orders off; goes living living, never looking day older, bless him! And suddenly produces heir, papers made proper. The Sackville-Bagginses won’t never see inside Bag End now, hoped not.’ ‘There’s tidy bit money tucked away there, I hear tell,’ said stranger, visitor business Michel Delving Westfarthing. ‘All top hill full tunnels packed chests gold silver, jools, I’ve heard.’ ‘Then you’ve heard I speak to,’ answered Gaffer. ‘I know nothing jools. Mr. Bilbo free money, seems lack it; I know tunnel-making. I saw Mr. Bilbo came back, matter sixty years ago, I lad. I’d long come prentice old Holman (him dad’s cousin), Bag End helping keep folks trampling trapessing garden sale on. And middle Mr. Bilbo comes Hill pony mighty big bags couple chests. I don’t doubt mostly full treasure picked foreign parts, mountains gold, say; wasn’t enough fill tunnels. But lad Sam know that. He’s Bag End. Crazy stories old days, is, listens Mr. Bilbo’s tales. Mr. Bilbo learned letters – meaning harm, mark you, I hope harm come it. ‘Elves Dragons! I says him. Cabbages potatoes better you. Don’t go getting mixed business betters, you’ll land trouble big you, I says him. And I might say others,’ added look stranger miller. But Gaffer convince audience. The legend Bilbo’s wealth firmly fixed minds younger generation hobbits. ‘Ah, likely enough adding brought first,’ argued miller, voicing common opinion. ‘He’s often away home. And look outlandish folk thatvisithim:dwarvescomingatnight,andthatoldwandering conjuror, Gandalf, all. You say like, Gaffer, Bag End’s queer place, folk queerer.’ ‘And say like, know boating, Mr. Sandyman,’ retorted Gaffer, disliking miller even usual. ‘If that’s queer, could bit queerness parts. There’s far away wouldn’t offer pint beer friend, lived hole golden walls. But things proper Bag End. Our Sam says everyone’s going invited party, there’s going presents, mark you, presents – month is.’ * * * That month September, fine could ask. A day two later rumour (probably started knowledgeable Sam) spread going fireworks – fireworks, more, seen Shire nigh century, indeed since Old Took died. Days passed The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon laden odd-looking packages rolled Hobbiton one evening toiled Hill Bag End. The startled hobbits peered lamplit doors gape it. It driven outlandish folk, singing strange songs: dwarves long beards deep hoods. A remained Bag End. At end second week September cart came Bywater direction Brandywine Bridge broad daylight. An old man driving alone. He wore tall pointed blue hat, long grey cloak, silver scarf. He long white beard bushy eyebrows stuck beyond brim hat. Small hobbitchildren ran cart Hobbiton right hill. It cargo fireworks, rightly guessed. At Bilbo’s front door old man began unload: great bundles fireworks sorts shapes, labelled large red G elf-rune, . That Gandalf’s mark, course, old man Gandalf Wizard, whose fame Shire due mainly skill fires, smokes, lights. His real business far difficult dangerous, Shire-folk knew nothing it. To one ‘attractions’ Party. Hence excitement hobbit-children. ‘G Grand!’ shouted, old man smiled. They knew sight, though appeared Hobbiton occasionally never stopped long; neither oldest elders seen one firework displays – belonged legendary past. When old man, helped Bilbo dwarves, finished unloading, Bilbo gave pennies away; single squib cracker forthcoming, disappointment onlookers. ‘Run away now!’ said Gandalf. ‘You get plenty time comes.’ Then disappeared inside Bilbo, door shut. The young hobbits stared door vain while, made off, feeling day party would never come. Inside Bag End, Bilbo Gandalf sitting open window small room looking west garden. The late afternoon bright peaceful. The flowers glowed red golden: snap-dragons sunflowers, nasturtians trailing turf walls peeping round windows. ‘How bright garden looks!’ said Gandalf. ‘Yes,’ said Bilbo. ‘I fond indeed it, dear old Shire; I think I need holiday.’ ‘You mean go plan then?’ ‘I do. I made mind months ago, I haven’t changed it.’ ‘Very well. It good saying more. Stick plan – whole plan, mind – I hope turn best, you, us.’ ‘I hope so. Anyway I mean enjoy Thursday, little joke.’ ‘Who laugh, I wonder?’ said Gandalf, shaking head. ‘We shall see,’ said Bilbo. The next day carts rolled Hill, still carts. There might grumbling ‘dealing locally’, week orders began pour Bag End every kind provision, commodity, luxury could obtained Hobbiton Bywater anywhere neighbourhood. People became enthusiastic; began tick days calendar; watched eagerly postman, hoping invitations. Before long invitations began pouring out, Hobbiton post-office blocked, Bywater postoffice snowed under, voluntary assistant postmen called for. There constant stream going Hill, carrying hundreds polite variations Thank you, I shall certainly come. A notice appeared gate Bag End: admittance except party business. Even had, pretended Party Business seldom allowed inside. Bilbo busy: writing invitations, ticking answers, packing presents, making private preparations own. From time Gandalf’s arrival remained hidden view. One morning hobbits woke find large field, south Bilbo’s front door, covered ropes poles tents pavilions. A special entrance cut bank leading road, wide steps large white gate built there. The three hobbit-families Bagshot Row, adjoining field, intensely interested generally envied. Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending work garden. The tents began go up. There specially large pavilion, big tree grew field right inside it, stood proudly near one end, head chief table. Lanterns hung branches. More promising still (to hobbits’ mind): enormous open-air kitchen erected north corner field. A draught cooks, every inn eating-house miles around, arrived supplement dwarves odd folk quartered Bag End. Excitement rose height. Then weather clouded over. That Wednesday eve Party. Anxiety intense. Then Thursday, September 22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, clouds vanished, flags unfurled fun began. Bilbo Baggins called party, really variety entertainments rolled one. Practically everybody living near invited. A overlooked accident, turned same, matter. Many people parts Shire also asked; even outside borders. Bilbo met guests (and additions) new white gate person. He gave away presents sundry – latter went back way came gate. Hobbits give presents people birthdays. Not expensive ones, rule, lavishly occasion; bad system. Actually Hobbiton Bywater every day year somebody’s birthday, every hobbit parts fair chance least one present least week. But never got tired them. On occasion presents unusually good. The hobbit-children excited almost forgot eating. There toys like never seen before, beautiful obviously magical. Many indeed ordered year before, come way Mountain Dale, real dwarf-make. When every guest welcomed finally inside gate, songs, dances, music, games, and, course, food drink. There three official meals: lunch, tea, dinner (or supper). But lunch tea marked chiefly fact times guests sitting eating together. At times merely lots people eating drinking – continuously elevenses six-thirty, fireworks started. The fireworks Gandalf: brought him, designed made him; special effects, set pieces, flights rockets let him. But also generous distribution squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles, elffountains, goblin-barkers thunder-claps. They superb. The art Gandalf improved age. There rockets like flight scintillating birds singing sweet voices. There green trees trunks dark smoke: leaves opened like whole spring unfolding moment, shining branches dropped glowing flowers upon astonished hobbits, disappearing sweet scent touched upturned faces. There fountains butterflies flew glittering trees; pillars coloured fires rose turned eagles, sailing ships, phalanx flying swans; red thunderstorm shower yellow rain; forest silver spears sprang suddenly air yell like embattled army, came Water hiss like hundred hot snakes. And also one last surprise, honour Bilbo, startled hobbits exceedingly, Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shaped like mountain seen distance, began glow summit. It spouted green scarlet flames. Out flew red-golden dragon – life-size, terribly life-like: fire came jaws, eyes glared down; roar, whizzed three times heads crowd. They ducked, many fell flat faces. The dragon passed like express train, turned somersault, burst Bywater deafening explosion. ‘That signal supper!’ said Bilbo. The pain alarm vanished once, prostrate hobbits leaped feet. There splendid supper everyone; everyone, is, except invited special family dinner-party. This held great pavilion tree. The invitations limited twelve dozen (a number also called hobbits one Gross, though word considered proper use people); guests selected families Bilbo Frodo related, addition special unrelated friends (such Gandalf). Many young hobbits included, present parental permission; hobbits easy-going children matter sitting late, especially chance getting free meal. Bringing young hobbits took lot provender. There many Bagginses Boffins, also many Tooks Brandybucks; various Grubbs (relations Bilbo Baggins’ grandmother), various Chubbs (connexions Took grandfather); selection Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brockhouses, Goodbodies, Hornblowers Proudfoots. Some distantly connected Bilbo, hardly ever Hobbiton before, lived remote corners Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses forgotten. Otho wife Lobelia present. They disliked Bilbo detested Frodo, magnificent invitation card, written golden ink, felt impossible refuse. Besides, cousin, Bilbo, specializing food many years table high reputation. All one hundred forty-four guests expected pleasant feast; though rather dreaded after-dinner speech host (an inevitable item). He liable drag bits called poetry; sometimes, glass two, would allude absurd adventures mysterious journey. The guests disappointed: pleasant feast, fact engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied, prolonged. The purchase provisions fell almost nothing throughout district ensuing weeks; Bilbo’s catering depleted stocks stores, cellars warehouses miles around, matter much. After feast (more less) came Speech. Most company were, however, tolerant mood, delightful stage called ‘filling corners’. They sipping favourite drinks, nibbling favourite dainties, fears forgotten. They prepared listen anything, cheer every full stop. My dear People, began Bilbo, rising place. ‘Hear! Hear! Hear!’ shouted, kept repeating chorus, seeming reluctant follow advice. Bilbo left place went stood chair illuminated tree. The light lanterns fell beaming face; golden buttons shone embroidered silk waistcoat. They could see standing, waving one hand air, trouser-pocket. My dear Bagginses Boffins, began again; dear Tooks Brandybucks, Grubbs, Chubbs, Burrowses, Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses Proudfoots. ‘Proudfeet!’ shouted elderly hobbit back pavilion. His name, course, Proudfoot, well merited; feet large, exceptionally furry, table. Proudfoots, repeated Bilbo. Also good Sackville-Bagginses I welcome back last Bag End. Today one hundred eleventh birthday: I eleventy-one today! ‘Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy Returns!’ shouted, hammered joyously tables. Bilbo splendidly. This sort stuff liked: short obvious. I hope enjoying much I am. Deafening cheers. Cries Yes (and No). Noises trumpets horns, pipes flutes, musical instruments. There were, said, many young hobbits present. Hundreds musical crackers pulled. Most bore mark dale them; convey much hobbits, agreed marvellous crackers. They contained instruments, small, perfect make enchanting tones. Indeed, one corner young Tooks Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo finished (since plainly said necessary), got impromptu orchestra, began merry dance-tune. Master Everard Took Miss Melilot Brandybuck got table bells hands began dance Springle-ring: pretty dance, rather vigorous. But Bilbo finished. Seizing horn youngster nearby, blew three loud hoots. The noise subsided. I shall keep long, cried. Cheers assembly. I called together Purpose. Something way said made impression. There almost silence, one two Tooks pricked ears. Indeed, Three Purposes! First all, tell I immensely fond all, eleventy-one years short time live among excellent admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst approval. I don’t know half half well I like; I like less half half well deserve. This unexpected rather difficult. There scattered clapping, trying work see came compliment. Secondly, celebrate birthday. Cheers again. I say: OUR birthday. For is, course, also birthday heir nephew, Frodo. He comes age inheritance today. Some perfunctory clapping elders; loud shouts ‘Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old Frodo,’ juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, wondered meant ‘coming inheritance’. Together score one hundred forty-four. Your numbers chosen fit remarkable total: One Gross, I may use expression. No cheers. This ridiculous. Many guests, especially Sackville-Bagginses, insulted, feeling sure asked fill required number, like goods package. ‘One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.’ It also, I may allowed refer ancient history, anniversary arrival barrel Esgaroth Long Lake; though fact birthday slipped memory occasion. I fifty-one then, birthdays seem important. The banquet splendid, however, though I bad cold time, I remember, could say ‘thag buch’. I repeat correctly: Thank much coming little party. Obstinate silence. They feared song poetry imminent; getting bored. Why couldn’t stop talking let drink health? But Bilbo sing recite. He paused moment. Thirdly finally, said, I wish make ANNOUNCEMENT. He spoke last word loudly suddenly everyone sat still could. I regret announce – though, I said, eleventy-one years far short time spend among – END. I going. I leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE! He stepped vanished. There blinding flash light, guests blinked. When opened eyes Bilbo nowhere seen. One hundred fortyfour flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo Proudfoot removed feet table stamped. Then dead silence, suddenly, several deep breaths, every Baggins, Boffin, Took, Brandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, Proudfoot began talk once. It generally agreed joke bad taste, food drink needed cure guests shock annoyance. ‘He’s mad. I always said so,’ probably popular comment. Even Tooks (with exceptions) thought Bilbo’s behaviour absurd. For moment took granted disappearance nothing ridiculous prank. But old Rory Brandybuck sure. Neither age enormous dinner clouded wits, said daughter-in-law, Esmeralda: ‘There’s something fishy this, dear! I believe mad Baggins again. Silly old fool. But worry? He hasn’t taken vittles him.’ He called loudly Frodo send wine round again. Frodo one present said nothing. For time sat silent beside Bilbo’s empty chair, ignored remarks questions. He enjoyed joke, course, even though know. He difficulty keeping laughter indignant surprise guests. But time felt deeply troubled: realized suddenly loved old hobbit dearly. Most guests went eating drinking discussing Bilbo Baggins’ oddities, past present; SackvilleBagginses already departed wrath. Frodo want party. He gave orders wine served; got drained glass silently health Bilbo, slipped pavilion. As Bilbo Baggins, even making speech, fingering golden ring pocket: magic ring kept secret many years. As stepped slipped finger, never seen hobbit Hobbiton again. He walked briskly back hole, stood moment listening smile din pavilion, sounds merrymaking parts field. Then went in. He took party clothes, folded wrapped tissue-paper embroidered silk waistcoat, put away. Then put quickly old untidy garments, fastened round waist worn leather belt. On hung short sword battered black-leather scabbard. From locked drawer, smelling moth-balls, took old cloak hood. They locked precious, patched weatherstained original colour could hardly guessed: might dark green. They rather large him. He went study, large strong-box took bundle wrapped old cloths, leather-bound manuscript; also large bulky envelope. The book bundle stuffed top heavy bag standing there, already nearly full. Into envelope slipped golden ring, fine chain, sealed it, addressed Frodo. At first put mantelpiece, suddenly removed stuck pocket. At moment door opened Gandalf came quickly in. ‘Hullo!’ said Bilbo. ‘I wondered would turn up.’ ‘I glad find visible,’ replied wizard, sitting chair, ‘I wanted catch final words. I suppose feel everything gone splendidly according plan?’ ‘Yes, I do,’ said Bilbo. ‘Though flash surprising: quite startled me, let alone others. A little addition own, I suppose?’ ‘It was. You wisely kept ring secret years, seemed necessary give guests something else would seem explain sudden vanishment.’ ‘And would spoil joke. You interfering old busybody,’ laughed Bilbo, ‘but I expect know best, usual.’ ‘I – I know anything. But I don’t feel sure whole affair. It come final point. You joke, alarmed offended relations, given whole Shire something talk nine days, ninety-nine likely. Are going further?’ ‘Yes, I am. I feel I need holiday, long holiday, I told before. Probably permanent holiday: I don’t expect I shall return. In fact, I don’t mean to, I made arrangements. ‘I old, Gandalf. I don’t look it, I beginning feel heart hearts. Well-preserved indeed!’ snorted. ‘Why, I feel thin, sort stretched, know I mean: like butter scraped much bread. That can’t right. I need change, something.’ Gandalf looked curiously closely him. ‘No, seem right,’ said thoughtfully. ‘No, I believe plan probably best.’ ‘Well, I’ve made mind, anyway. I want see mountains again, Gandalf – mountains; find somewhere I rest. In peace quiet, without lot relatives prying around, string confounded visitors hanging bell. I might find somewhere I finish book. I thought nice ending it: lived happily ever end days.’ Gandalf laughed. ‘I hope will. But nobody read book, however ends.’ ‘Oh, may, years come. Frodo read already, far gone. You’ll keep eye Frodo, won’t you?’ ‘Yes, I – two eyes, often I spare them.’ ‘He would come me, course, I asked him. In fact offered once, party. But really want to, yet. I want see wild country I die, Mountains; still love Shire, woods fields little rivers. He ought comfortable here. I leaving everything him, course, except oddments. I hope happy, gets used own. It’s time master now.’ ‘Everything?’ said Gandalf. ‘The ring well? You agreed that, remember.’ ‘Well, er, yes, I suppose so,’ stammered Bilbo. ‘Where it?’ ‘In envelope, must know,’ said Bilbo impatiently. ‘There mantelpiece. Well, no! Here pocket!’ He hesitated. ‘Isn’t odd now?’ said softly himself. ‘Yet all, not? Why shouldn’t stay there?’ Gandalf looked hard Bilbo, gleam eyes. ‘I think, Bilbo,’ said quietly, ‘I leave behind. Don’t want to?’ ‘Well yes – no. Now comes it, I don’t like parting all, I may say. And I don’t really see I should. Why want to?’ asked, curious change came voice. It sharp suspicion annoyance. ‘You always badgering ring; never bothered things I got journey.’ ‘No, I badger you,’ said Gandalf. ‘I wanted truth. It important. Magic rings – well, magical; rare curious. I professionally interested ring, may say; I still am. I like know is, go wandering again. Also I think quite long enough. You won’t need more, Bilbo, unless I quite mistaken.’ Bilbo flushed, angry light eyes. His kindly face grew hard. ‘Why not?’ cried. ‘And business yours, anyway, know I things? It own. I found it. It came me.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ said Gandalf. ‘But need get angry.’ ‘If I fault,’ said Bilbo. ‘It mine, I tell you. My own. My Precious. Yes, Precious.’ The wizard’s face remained grave attentive, flicker deep eyes showed startled indeed alarmed. ‘It called before,’ said, ‘but you.’ ‘But I say now. And not? Even Gollum said once. It’s now, mine. And I shall keep it, I say.’ Gandalf stood up. He spoke sternly. ‘You fool do, Bilbo,’ said. ‘You make clearer every word say. It got far much hold you. Let go! And go yourself, free.’ ‘I’ll I choose go I please,’ said Bilbo obstinately. ‘Now, now, dear hobbit!’ said Gandalf. ‘All long life friends, owe something. Come! Do promised: give up!’ ‘Well, want ring yourself, say so!’ cried Bilbo. ‘But won’t get it. I won’t give Precious away, I tell you.’ His hand strayed hilt small sword. Gandalf’s eyes flashed. ‘It turn get angry soon,’ said. ‘If say again, I shall. Then see Gandalf Grey uncloaked.’ He took step towards hobbit, seemed grow tall menacing; shadow filled little room. Bilbo backed away wall, breathing hard, hand clutching pocket. They stood facing one another, air room tingled. Gandalf’s eyes remained bent hobbit. Slowly hands relaxed, began tremble. ‘I don’t know come you, Gandalf,’ said. ‘You never like before. What about? It mine isn’t it? I found it, Gollum would killed me, I hadn’t kept it. I’m thief, whatever said.’ ‘I never called one,’ Gandalf answered. ‘And I one either. I trying rob you, help you. I wish would trust me, used.’ He turned away, shadow passed. He seemed dwindle old grey man, bent troubled. Bilbo drew hand eyes. ‘I sorry,’ said. ‘But I felt queer. And yet would relief way bothered more. It growing mind lately. Sometimes I felt like eye looking me. And I always wanting put disappear, don’t know; wondering safe, pulling make sure. I tried locking up, I found I couldn’t rest without pocket. I don’t know why. And I don’t seem able make mind.’ ‘Then trust mine,’ said Gandalf. ‘It quite made up. Go away leave behind. Stop possessing it. Give Frodo, I look him.’ Bilbo stood moment tense undecided. Presently sighed. ‘All right,’ said effort. ‘I will.’ Then shrugged shoulders, smiled rather ruefully. ‘After that’s party business about, really: give away lots birthday-presents, somehow make easier give away time. It hasn’t made easier end, would pity waste preparations. It would quite spoil joke.’ ‘Indeed would take away point I ever saw affair,’ said Gandalf. ‘Very well,’ said Bilbo, ‘it goes Frodo rest.’ He drew deep breath. ‘And I really must starting, somebody else catch me. I said good-bye, I couldn’t bear again.’ He picked bag moved door. ‘You still got ring pocket,’ said wizard. ‘Well, I have!’ cried Bilbo. ‘And documents too. You better take deliver me. That safest.’ ‘No, don’t give ring me,’ said Gandalf. ‘Put mantelpiece. It safe enough there, till Frodo comes. I shall wait him.’ Bilbo took envelope, set clock, hand jerked back, packet fell floor. Before could pick up, wizard stooped seized set place. A spasm anger passed swiftly hobbit’s face again. Suddenly gave way look relief laugh. ‘Well, that’s that,’ said. ‘Now I’m off!’ They went hall. Bilbo chose favourite stick stand; whistled. Three dwarves came different rooms busy. ‘Is everything ready?’ asked Bilbo. ‘Everything packed labelled?’ ‘Everything,’ answered. ‘Well, let’s start then!’ He stepped front-door. It fine night, black sky dotted stars. He looked up, sniffing air. ‘What fun! What fun again, Road dwarves! This I really longing for, years! Good-bye!’ said, looking old home bowing door. ‘Good-bye, Gandalf!’ ‘Good-bye, present, Bilbo. Take care yourself! You old enough, perhaps wise enough.’ ‘Take care! I don’t care. Don’t worry me! I happy I ever been, saying great deal. But time come. I swept feet last,’ added, low voice, himself, sang softly dark: The Road goes ever Down door began. Now far ahead Road gone, And I must follow, I can, Pursuing eager feet, Until joins larger way Where many paths errands meet. And whither then? I cannot say. He paused, silent moment. Then without another word turned away lights voices field tents, followed three companions went round garden, trotted long sloping path. He jumped low place hedge bottom, took meadows, passing night like rustle wind grass. Gandalf remained staring darkness. ‘Good-bye, dear Bilbo – next meeting!’ said softly went back indoors. Frodo came soon afterwards, found sitting dark, deep thought. ‘Has gone?’ asked. ‘Yes,’ answered Gandalf, ‘he gone last.’ ‘I wish – I mean, I hoped evening joke,’ said Frodo. ‘But I knew heart really meant go. He always used joke serious things. I wish I come back sooner, see off.’ ‘I think really preferred slipping quietly end,’ said Gandalf. ‘Don’t troubled. He’ll right – now. He left packet you. There is!’ Frodo took envelope mantelpiece, glanced it, open it. ‘You’ll find documents there, I think,’ said wizard. ‘You master Bag End now. And also, I fancy, you’ll find golden ring.’ ‘The ring!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘Has left that? I wonder why. Still, may useful.’ ‘It may, may not,’ said Gandalf. ‘I make use it, I you. But keep secret, keep safe! Now I going bed.’ * * * As master Bag End Frodo felt painful duty say good-bye guests. Rumours strange events spread field, Frodo would say doubt everything cleared morning. About midnight carriages came important folk. One one rolled away, filled full unsatisfied hobbits. Gardeners came arrangement, removed wheelbarrows inadvertently remained behind. Night slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later. Morning went on. People came began (by orders) clear away pavilions tables chairs, spoons knives bottles plates, lanterns, flowering shrubs boxes, crumbs cracker-paper, forgotten bags gloves handkerchiefs, uneaten food (a small item). Then number people came (without orders): Bagginses, Boffins, Bolgers, Tooks, guests lived staying near. By mid-day, even bestfed again, large crowd Bag End, uninvited unexpected. Frodo waiting step, smiling, looking rather tired worried. He welcomed callers, much say before. His reply inquiries simply this: ‘Mr. Bilbo Baggins gone away; far I know, good.’ Some visitors invited come inside, Bilbo left ‘messages’ them. Inside hall piled large assortment packages parcels small articles furniture. On every item label tied. There several labels sort: For ADELARD TOOK, VERY OWN, Bilbo; umbrella. Adelard carried many unlabelled ones. For DORA BAGGINS memory LONG correspondence, love Bilbo; large waste-paper basket. Dora Drogo’s sister eldest surviving female relative Bilbo Frodo; ninety-nine, written reams good advice half century. For MILO BURROWS, hoping useful, B.B.; gold pen ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters. For ANGELICA’S use, Uncle Bilbo; round convex mirror. She young Baggins, obviously considered face shapely. For collection HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, contributor; (empty) book-case. Hugo great borrower books, worse usual returning them. For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, PRESENT; case silver spoons. Bilbo believed acquired good many spoons, away former journey. Lobelia knew quite well. When arrived later day, took point once, also took spoons. This small selection assembled presents. Bilbo’s residence got rather cluttered things course long life. It tendency hobbit-holes get cluttered up: custom giving many birthday-presents largely responsible. Not, course, birthday-presents always new; one two old mathoms forgotten uses circulated around district; Bilbo usually given new presents, kept received. The old hole cleared little. Every one various parting gifts labels, written personally Bilbo, several point, joke. But, course, things given would wanted welcome. The poorer hobbits, especially Bagshot Row, well. Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks potatoes, new spade, woollen waistcoat, bottle ointment creaking joints. Old Rory Brandybuck, return much hospitality, got dozen bottles Old Winyards: strong red wine Southfarthing, quite mature, laid Bilbo’s father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, voted capital fellow first bottle. There plenty everything left Frodo. And, course, chief treasures, well books, pictures, enough furniture, left possession. There was, however, sign mention money jewellery: penny-piece glass bead given away. Frodo trying time afternoon. A false rumour whole household distributed free spread like wildfire; long place packed people business there, could kept out. Labels got torn mixed, quarrels broke out. Some people tried swaps deals hall; others tried make minor items addressed them, anything seemed unwanted unwatched. The road gate blocked barrows handcarts. In middle commotion Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo retired left friend Merry Brandybuck keep eye things. When Otho loudly demanded see Frodo, Merry bowed politely. ‘He indisposed,’ said. ‘He resting.’ ‘Hiding, mean,’ said Lobelia. ‘Anyway want see mean see him. Just go tell so!’ Merry left long hall, time discover parting gift spoons. It improve tempers. Eventually shown study. Frodo sitting table lot papers front him. He looked indisposed – see Sackville-Bagginses rate; stood up, fidgeting something pocket. But spoke quite politely. The Sackville-Bagginses rather offensive. They began offering bad bargain-prices (as friends) various valuable unlabelled things. When Frodo replied things specially directed Bilbo given away, said whole affair fishy. ‘Only one thing clear me,’ said Otho, ‘and exceedingly well it. I insist seeing will.’ Otho would Bilbo’s heir, adoption Frodo. He read carefully snorted. It was, unfortunately, clear correct (according legal customs hobbits, demand among things seven signatures witnesses red ink). ‘Foiled again!’ said wife. ‘And waiting sixty years. Spoons? Fiddlesticks!’ He snapped fingers Frodo’s nose stumped off. But Lobelia easily got rid of. A little later Frodo came study see things going on, found still place, investigating nooks corners, tapping floors. He escorted firmly premises, relieved several small (but rather valuable) articles somehow fallen inside umbrella. Her face looked throes thinking really crushing parting remark; found say, turning round step, was: ‘You’ll live regret it, young fellow! Why didn’t go too? You don’t belong here; you’re Baggins – – you’re Brandybuck!’ ‘Did hear that, Merry? That insult, like,’ said Frodo shut door her. ‘It compliment,’ said Merry Brandybuck, ‘and so, course, true.’ Then went round hole, evicted three young hobbits (two Boffins Bolger) knocking holes walls one cellars. Frodo also tussle young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot’s grandson), begun excavation larger pantry, thought echo. The legend Bilbo’s gold excited curiosity hope; legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, positively ill-gotten), is, everyone knows, anyone’s finding – unless search interrupted. When overcome Sancho pushed out, Frodo collapsed chair hall. ‘It’s time close shop, Merry,’ said. ‘Lock door, don’t open anyone today, even bring battering ram.’ Then went revive belated cup tea. He hardly sat down, came soft knock front-door. ‘Lobelia likely,’ thought. ‘She must thought something really nasty, come back say it. It wait.’ He went tea. The knock repeated, much louder, took notice. Suddenly wizard’s head appeared window. ‘If don’t let in, Frodo, I shall blow door right hole hill,’ said. ‘My dear Gandalf! Half minute!’ cried Frodo, running room door. ‘Come in! Come in! I thought Lobelia.’ ‘Then I forgive you. But I saw time ago, driving pony-trap towards Bywater face would curdled new milk.’ ‘She already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried Bilbo’s ring. I longed disappear.’ ‘Don’t that!’ said Gandalf, sitting down. ‘Do careful ring, Frodo! In fact, partly I come say last word.’ ‘Well, it?’ ‘What know already?’ ‘Only Bilbo told me. I heard story: found it, used it: journey, I mean.’ ‘Which story, I wonder,’ said Gandalf. ‘Oh, told dwarves put book,’ said Frodo. ‘He told true story soon I came live here. He said pestered till told you, I better know too. ‘‘No secrets us, Frodo,’’ said; ‘‘but go further. It’s mine anyway.’’’ ‘That’s interesting,’ said Gandalf. ‘Well, think all?’ ‘If mean, inventing ‘‘present’’, well, I thought true story much likely, I couldn’t see point altering all. It unlike Bilbo so, anyway; I thought rather odd.’ ‘So I. But odd things may happen people treasures – use them. Let warning careful it. It may powers making vanish wish to.’ ‘I don’t understand,’ said Frodo. ‘Neither I,’ answered wizard. ‘I merely begun wonder ring, especially since last night. No need worry. But take advice use seldom, all. At least I beg use way cause talk rouse suspicion. I say again: keep safe, keep secret!’ ‘You mysterious! What afraid of?’ ‘I certain, I say more. I may able tell something I come back. I going once: good-bye present.’ He got up. ‘At once!’ cried Frodo. ‘Why, I thought staying least week. I looking forward help.’ ‘I mean – I change mind. I may away good while; I’ll come see again, soon I can. Expect see me! I shall slip quietly. I shan’t often visiting Shire openly again. I find I become rather unpopular. They say I nuisance disturber peace. Some people actually accusing spiriting Bilbo away, worse. If want know, supposed plot get hold wealth.’ ‘Some people!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘You mean Otho Lobelia. How abominable! I would give Bag End everything else, I could get Bilbo back go tramping country him. I love Shire. But I begin wish, somehow, I gone too. I wonder I shall ever see again.’ ‘So I,’ said Gandalf. ‘And I wonder many things. Good-bye now! Take care yourself! Look me, especially unlikely times! Good-bye!’ Frodo saw door. He gave final wave hand, walked surprising pace; Frodo thought old wizard looked unusually bent, almost carrying great weight. The evening closing in, cloaked figure quickly vanished twilight. Frodo see long time. Chapter 2 THE SHADOW OF THE PAST The talk die nine even ninety-nine days. The second disappearance Mr. Bilbo Baggins discussed Hobbiton, indeed Shire, year day, remembered much longer that. It became fireside-story young hobbits; eventually Mad Baggins, used vanish bang flash reappear bags jewels gold, became favourite character legend lived long true events forgotten. But meantime, general opinion neighbourhood Bilbo, always rather cracked, last gone quite mad, run Blue. There undoubtedly fallen pool river come tragic, hardly untimely, end. The blame mostly laid Gandalf. ‘If dratted wizard leave young Frodo alone, perhaps he’ll settle grow hobbit-sense,’ said. And appearance wizard leave Frodo alone, settle down, growth hobbit-sense noticeable. Indeed, began carry Bilbo’s reputation oddity. He refused go mourning; next year gave party honour Bilbo’s hundred-and-twelfth birthday, called Hundredweight Feast. But short mark, twenty guests invited several meals snowed food rained drink, hobbits say. Some people rather shocked; Frodo kept custom giving Bilbo’s Birthday Party year year got used it. He said think Bilbo dead. When asked: ‘Where then?’ shrugged shoulders. He lived alone, Bilbo done; good many friends, especially among younger hobbits (mostly descendants Old Took) children fond Bilbo often Bag End. Folco Boffin Fredegar Bolger two these; closest friends Peregrin Took (usually called Pippin), Merry Brandybuck (his real name Meriadoc, seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping Shire them; often wandered himself, amazement sensible folk sometimes seen far home walking hills woods starlight. Merry Pippin suspected visited Elves times, Bilbo done. As time went on, people began notice Frodo also showed signs good ‘preservation’: outwardly retained appearance robust energetic hobbit tweens. ‘Some folk luck,’ said; Frodo approached usually sober age fifty began think queer. Frodohimself,afterthefirstshock,foundthatbeinghisown master Mr. Baggins Bag End rather pleasant. For years quite happy worry much future. But half unknown regret gone Bilbo steadily growing. He found wondering times, especially autumn, wild lands, strange visions mountains never seen came dreams. He began say himself: ‘Perhaps I shall cross River one day.’ To half mind always replied: ‘Not yet.’ So went on, forties running out, fiftieth birthday drawing near: fifty number felt somehow significant (or ominous); rate age adventure suddenly befallen Bilbo. Frodo began feel restless, old paths seemed well-trodden. He looked maps, wondered lay beyond edges: maps made Shire showed mostly white spaces beyond borders. He took wandering afield often himself; Merry friends watched anxiously. Often seen walking talking strange wayfarers began time appear Shire. There rumours strange things happening world outside; Gandalf time appeared sentanymessageforseveralyears,Frodogatheredallthenews could. Elves, seldom walked Shire, could seen passing westward woods evening, passing returning; leaving Middle-earth longer concerned troubles. There were, however, dwarves road unusual numbers. The ancient East–West Road ran Shire end Grey Havens, dwarves always used way mines Blue Mountains. They hobbits’ chief source news distant parts – wanted any: rule dwarves said little hobbits asked more. But Frodo often met strange dwarves far countries, seeking refuge West. They troubled, spoke whispers Enemy Land Mordor. That name hobbits knew legends dark past, like shadow background memories; ominous disquieting. It seemed evil power Mirkwood driven White Council reappear greater strength old strongholds Mordor. The Dark Tower rebuilt, said. From power spreading far wide, away far east south wars growing fear. Orcs multiplying mountains. Trolls abroad, longer dull-witted, cunning armed dreadful weapons. And murmured hints creatures terrible these, name. * * * Little this, course, reached ears ordinary hobbits. But even deafest stay-at-home began hear queer tales; whose business took borders saw strange things. The conversation The Green Dragon Bywater, one evening spring Frodo’s fiftieth year, showed even comfortable heart Shire rumours heard, though hobbits still laughed them. Sam Gamgee sitting one corner near fire, opposite Ted Sandyman, miller’s son; various rustic hobbits listening talk. ‘Queer things hear days, sure,’ said Sam. ‘Ah,’ said Ted, ‘you do, listen. But I hear firesidetales children’s stories home, I want to.’ ‘No doubt can,’ retorted Sam, ‘and I daresay there’s truth reckon. Who invented stories anyway? Take dragons now.’ ‘No thank ’ee,’ said Ted, ‘I won’t. I heard tell I youngster, there’s call believe now. There’s one Dragon Bywater, that’s Green,’ said, getting general laugh. ‘All right,’ said Sam, laughing rest. ‘But Tree-men, giants, might call them? They say one bigger tree seen away beyond North Moors long back.’ ‘Who’s they?’ ‘My cousin Hal one. He works Mr. Boffin Overhill goes Northfarthing hunting. He saw one.’ ‘Says did, perhaps. Your Hal’s always saying he’s seen things; maybe sees things ain’t there.’ ‘But one big elm tree, walking – walking seven yards stride, inch.’ ‘Then I bet wasn’t inch. What saw elm tree, like not.’ ‘But one walking, I tell you; ain’t elm tree North Moors.’ ‘Then Hal can’t seen one,’ said Ted. There laughing clapping: audience seemed think Ted scored point. ‘All same,’ said Sam, ‘you can’t deny others besides Halfast seen queer folk crossing Shire – crossing it, mind you: turned back borders. The Bounders never busy before. ‘And I’ve heard tell Elves moving west. They say going harbours, away beyond White Towers.’ Sam waved arm vaguely: neither knew far Sea, past old towers beyond western borders Shire. But old tradition away stood Grey Havens, times elven-ships set sail, never return. ‘They sailing, sailing, sailing Sea, going West leaving us,’ said Sam, half chanting words, shaking head sadly solemnly. But Ted laughed. ‘Well, isn’t anything new, believe old tales. And I don’t see matters you. Let sail! But I warrant haven’t seen it; anyone else Shire.’ ‘Well, I don’t know,’ said Sam thoughtfully. He believed seen Elf woods, still hoped see one day. Of legends heard early years fragments tales half-remembered stories Elves hobbits knew, always moved deeply. ‘There some, even parts, know Fair Folk get news them,’ said. ‘There’s Mr. Baggins now, I work for. He told sailingandheknowsabitaboutElves.AndoldMr.Bilboknew more: many’s talk I I little lad.’ ‘Oh, they’re cracked,’ said Ted. ‘Leastways old Bilbo cracked, Frodo’s cracking. If that’s get news from, you’ll never want moonshine. Well, friends, I’m home. Your good health!’ He drained mug went noisily. Sam sat silent said more. He good deal think about. For one thing, lot Bag End garden, would busy day tomorrow, weather cleared. The grass growing fast. But Sam mind gardening. After sighed, got went out. It early April sky clearing heavy rain. The sun down, cool pale evening quietly fading night. He walked home early stars Hobbiton Hill, whistling softly thoughtfully. It time Gandalf reappeared long absence. For three years Party away. Then paid Frodo brief visit, taking good look went again. During next year two turned fairly often, coming unexpectedly dusk, going without warning sunrise. He would discuss business journeys, seemed chiefly interested small news Frodo’s health doings. Then suddenly visits ceased. It nine years since Frodo seen heard him, begun think wizard would never return given interest hobbits. But evening, Sam walking home twilight fading, came familiar tap study window. Frodo welcomed old friend surprise great delight. They looked hard one another. ‘All well eh?’ said Gandalf. ‘You look ever, Frodo!’ ‘So you,’ Frodo replied; secretly thought Gandalf looked older careworn. He pressed news wide world, soon deep talk, stayed far night. Next morning late breakfast, wizard sitting Frodo open window study. A bright fire hearth, sun warm, wind South. Everything looked fresh, new green spring shimmering fields tips trees’ fingers. Gandalf thinking spring, nearly eighty years before, Bilbo run Bag End without handkerchief. His hair perhaps whiter then, beard eyebrows perhaps longer, face lined care wisdom; eyes bright ever, smoked blew smoke-rings vigour delight. He smoking silence, Frodo sitting still, deep thought. Even light morning felt dark shadow tidings Gandalf brought. At last broke silence. ‘Last night began tell strange things ring, Gandalf,’ said. ‘And stopped, said matters best left daylight. Don’t think better finish now? You say ring dangerous, far dangerous I guess. In way?’ ‘In many ways,’ answered wizard. ‘It far powerful I ever dared think first, powerful end would utterly overcome anyone mortal race possessed it. It would possess him. ‘In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings made, magic rings call them, were, course, various kinds: potent less. The lesser rings essays craft full-grown, Elven-smiths trifles – yet still mind dangerous mortals. But Great Rings, Rings Power, perilous. ‘A mortal, Frodo, keeps one Great Rings, die, grow obtain life, merely continues, last every minute weariness. And often uses Ring make invisible, fades: becomes end invisible permanently, walks twilight eye Dark Power rules Rings. Yes, sooner later – later, strong well-meaning begin with, neither strength good purpose last – sooner later Dark Power devour him.’ ‘How terrifying!’ said Frodo. There another long silence. The sound Sam Gamgee cutting lawn came garden. ‘How long known this?’ asked Frodo length. ‘And much Bilbo know?’ ‘Bilbo knew told you, I sure,’ said Gandalf. ‘He would certainly never passed anything thought would danger, even though I promised look you. He thought ring beautiful, useful need; anything wrong queer, himself. He said ‘‘growing mind’’, always worrying it; suspect ring blame. Though found thing needed looking after; seem always size weight; shrank expanded odd way, might suddenly slip finger tight.’ ‘Yes, warned last letter,’ said Frodo, ‘so I always kept chain.’ ‘Very wise,’ said Gandalf. ‘But long life, Bilbo never connected ring all. He took credit himself, proud it. Though getting restless uneasy. Thin stretched said. A sign ring getting control.’ ‘How long known this?’ asked Frodo again. ‘Known?’ said Gandalf. ‘I known much Wise know, Frodo. But mean ‘‘known ring’’, well, I still know, one might say. There last test make. But I longer doubt guess. ‘When I first begin guess?’ mused, searching back memory. ‘Let see – year White Council drove Dark Power Mirkwood, Battle Five Armies, Bilbo found ring. A shadow fell heart then, though I know yet I feared. I wondered often Gollum came Great Ring, plainly – least clear first. Then I heard Bilbo’s strange story ‘‘won’’ it, I could believe it. When I last got truth him, I saw trying put claim ring beyond doubt. Much like Gollum ‘‘birthdaypresent’’. The lies much alike comfort. Clearly ring unwholesome power set work keeper once. That first real warning I well. I told Bilbo often rings better left unused; resented it, soon got angry. There little else I could do. I could take without greater harm; I right anyway. I could watch wait. I might perhaps consulted Saruman White, something always held back.’ ‘Who he?’ asked Frodo. ‘I never heard before.’ ‘Maybe not,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Hobbits are, were, concern his. Yet great among Wise. He chief order head Council. His knowledge deep, pride grown it, takes ill meddling. The lore Elven-rings, great small, province. He long studied it, seeking lost secrets making; Rings debated Council, would reveal us ring-lore told fears. So doubt slept – uneasily. Still I watched I waited. ‘And seemed well Bilbo. And years passed. Yes, passed, seemed touch him. He showed signs age. The shadow fell again. But I said myself: ‘‘After comes long-lived family mother’s side. There time yet. Wait!’’ ‘And I waited. Until night left house. He said things filled fear words Saruman could allay. I knew last something dark deadly work. And I spent years since finding truth it.’ ‘There wasn’t permanent harm done, there?’ asked Frodo anxiously. ‘He would get right time, wouldn’t he? Be able rest peace, I mean?’ ‘He felt better once,’ said Gandalf. ‘But one Power world knows Rings effects; far I know Power world knows hobbits. Among Wise I one goes hobbit-lore: obscure branch knowledge, full surprises. Soft butter be, yet sometimes tough old tree-roots. I think likely would resist Rings far longer Wise would believe. I don’t think need worry Bilbo. ‘Of course, possessed ring many years, used it, might take long influence wear – safe see again, instance. Otherwise, might live years, quite happily: stop parted it. For gave end accord: important point. No, I troubled dear Bilbo more, let thing go. It I feel responsible. ‘Ever since Bilbo left I deeply concerned you, charming, absurd, helpless hobbits. It would grievous blow world, Dark Power overcame Shire; kind, jolly, stupid Bolgers, Hornblowers, Boffins, Bracegirdles, rest, mention ridiculous Bagginses, became enslaved.’ Frodo shuddered. ‘But be?’ asked. ‘And want slaves?’ ‘To tell truth,’ replied Gandalf, ‘I believe hitherto – hitherto, mark – entirely overlooked existence hobbits. You thankful. But safety passed. He need – many useful servants – won’t forget again. And hobbits miserable slaves would please far hobbits happy free. There thing malice revenge.’ ‘Revenge?’ said Frodo. ‘Revenge what? I still don’t understand Bilbo myself, ring.’ ‘It everything it,’ said Gandalf. ‘You know real peril yet; shall. I sure I last here; time come speak. Give ring moment.’ Frodo took breeches-pocket, clasped chain hung belt. He unfastened handed slowly wizard. It felt suddenly heavy, either Frodo way reluctant Gandalf touch it. Gandalf held up. It looked made pure solid gold. ‘Can see markings it?’ asked. ‘No,’ said Frodo. ‘There none. It quite plain, never shows scratch sign wear.’ ‘Well then, look!’ To Frodo’s astonishment distress wizard threw suddenly middle glowing corner fire. Frodo gave cry groped tongs; Gandalf held back. ‘Wait!’ said commanding voice, giving Frodo quick look bristling brows. No apparent change came ring. After Gandalf got up, closed shutters outside window, drew curtains. The room became dark silent, though clack Sam’s shears, nearer windows, could still heard faintly garden. For moment wizard stood looking fire; stooped removed ring hearth tongs, picked up. Frodo gasped. ‘It quite cool,’ said Gandalf. ‘Take it!’ Frodo received shrinking palm: seemed become thicker heavier ever. ‘Hold up!’ said Gandalf. ‘And look closely!’ As Frodo so, saw fine lines, finer finest pen-strokes, running along ring, outside inside: lines fire seemed form letters flowing script. They shone piercingly bright, yet remote, great depth. ‘I cannot read fiery letters,’ said Frodo quavering voice. ‘No,’ said Gandalf, ‘but I can. The letters Elvish, ancient mode, language Mordor, I utter here. But Common Tongue said, close enough: One Ring rule all, One Ring find them, One Ring bring darkness bind them. It two lines verse long known Elven-lore: Three Rings Elven-kings sky, Seven Dwarf-lords halls stone, Nine Mortal Men doomed die, One Dark Lord dark throne In Land Mordor Shadows lie. One Ring rule all, One Ring find them, One Ring bring darkness bind In Land Mordor Shadows lie.’ He paused, said slowly deep voice: ‘This Master-ring, One Ring rule all. This One Ring lost many ages ago, great weakening power. He greatly desires – must get it.’ Frodo sat silent motionless. Fear seemed stretch vast hand, like dark cloud rising East looming engulf him. ‘This ring!’ stammered. ‘How, earth come me?’ ‘Ah!’ said Gandalf. ‘That long story. The beginnings lie back Black Years, lore-masters remember. If I tell tale, still sitting Spring passed Winter. ‘But last night I told Sauron Great, Dark Lord. The rumours heard true: indeed arisen left hold Mirkwood returned ancient fastness Dark Tower Mordor. That name even hobbits heard of, like shadow borders old stories. Always defeat respite, Shadow takes another shape grows again.’ ‘I wish need happened time,’ said Frodo. ‘So I,’ said Gandalf, ‘and live see times. But decide. All decide time given us. And already, Frodo, time beginning look black. The Enemy fast becoming strong. His plans far ripe, I think, ripening. We shall hard put it. We hard put it, even dreadful chance. ‘The Enemy still lacks one thing give strength knowledge beat resistance, break last defences, cover lands second darkness. He lacks One Ring. ‘The Three, fairest all, Elf-lords hid him, hand never touched sullied them. Seven Dwarf-kings possessed, three recovered, others dragons consumed. Nine gave Mortal Men, proud great, ensnared them. Long ago fell dominion One, became Ringwraiths, shadows great Shadow, terrible servants. Long ago. It many year since Nine walked abroad. Yet knows? As Shadow grows more, may walk again. But come! We speak things even morning Shire. ‘So now: Nine gathered himself; Seven also, else destroyed. The Three hidden still. But longer troubles him. He needs One; made Ring himself, his, let great part former power pass it, could rule others. If recovers it, command again, wherever be, even Three, wrought laid bare, stronger ever. ‘And dreadful chance, Frodo. He believed One perished; Elves destroyed it, done. But knows perished, found. So seeking it, seeking it, thought bent it. It great hope great fear.’ ‘Why, wasn’t destroyed?’ cried Frodo. ‘And Enemy ever come lose it, strong, precious him?’ He clutched Ring hand, saw already dark fingers stretching seize it. ‘It taken him,’ said Gandalf. ‘The strength Elves resist greater long ago; Men estranged them. The Men Westernesse came aid. That chapter ancient history might good recall; sorrow too, gathering dark, great valour, great deeds wholly vain. One day, perhaps, I tell tale, shall hear told full one knows best. ‘But moment, since need know thing came you, tale enough, I say. It Gil-galad, Elven-king Elendil Westernesse overthrew Sauron, though perished deed; Isildur Elendil’s son cut Ring Sauron’s hand took own. Then Sauron vanquished spirit fled hidden long years, shadow took shape Mirkwood. ‘But Ring lost. It fell Great River, Anduin, vanished. For Isildur marching north along east banks River, near Gladden Fields waylaid Orcs Mountains, almost folk slain. He leaped waters, Ring slipped finger swam, Orcs saw killed arrows.’ Gandalf paused. ‘And dark pools amid Gladden Fields,’ said, ‘the Ring passed knowledge legend; even much history known few, Council Wise could discover more. But last I carry story, I think. ‘Long after, still long ago, lived banks Great River edge Wilderland clever-handed quiet-footed little people. I guess hobbitkind; akin fathers fathers Stoors, loved River, often swam it, made little boats reeds. There among family high repute, large wealthier most, ruled grandmother folk, stern wise old lore, had. The inquisitive curious-minded family called Sme´agol. He interested roots beginnings; dived deep pools; burrowed trees growing plants; tunnelled green mounds; ceased look hill-tops, leaves trees, flowers opening air: head eyes downward. ‘He friend called De´agol, similar sort, sharpereyed quick strong. On time took boat went Gladden Fields, great beds iris flowering reeds. There Sme´agol got went nosing banks De´agol sat boat fished. Suddenly great fish took hook, knew was, dragged water, bottom. Then let go line, thought saw something shining river-bed; holding breath grabbed it. ‘Then came spluttering, weeds hair handful mud; swam bank. And behold! washed mud away, hand lay beautiful golden ring; shone glittered sun, heart glad. But Sme´agol watching behind tree, De´agol gloated ring, Sme´agol came softly behind. ‘‘‘Give us that, De´agol, love,’’ said Sme´agol, friend’s shoulder. ‘‘‘Why?’’ said De´agol. ‘‘‘Because it’s birthday, love, I wants it,’’ said Sme´agol. ‘‘‘I don’t care,’’ said De´agol. ‘‘I given present already, I could afford. I found this, I’m going keep it.’’ ‘‘‘Oh, indeed, love,’’ said Sme´agol; caught De´agol throat strangled him, gold looked bright beautiful. Then put ring finger. ‘No one ever found become De´agol; murdered far home, body cunningly hidden. But Sme´agol returned alone; found none family could see him, wearing ring. He pleased discovery concealed it; used find secrets, put knowledge crooked malicious uses. He became sharp-eyed keen-eared hurtful. The ring given power according stature. It wondered became unpopular shunned (when visible) relations. They kicked him, bit feet. He took thieving, going muttering himself, gurgling throat. So called Gollum, cursed him, told go far away; grandmother, desiring peace, expelled family turned hole. ‘He wandered loneliness, weeping little hardness world, journeyed River, till came stream flowed mountains, went way. He caught fish deep pools invisible fingers ate raw. One day hot, bending pool, felt burning back head, dazzling light water pained wet eyes. He wondered it, almost forgotten Sun. Then last time looked shook fist her. ‘But lowered eyes, saw far ahead tops Misty Mountains, stream came. And thought suddenly: ‘‘It would cool shady mountains. The Sun could watch there. The roots mountains must roots indeed; must great secrets buried discovered since beginning.’’ ‘So journeyed night highlands, found little cave dark stream ran; wormed way like maggot heart hills, vanished knowledge. The Ring went shadows him, even maker, power begun grow again, could learn nothing it.’ ‘Gollum!’ cried Frodo. ‘Gollum? Do mean Gollum-creature Bilbo met? How loathsome!’ ‘I think sad story,’ said wizard, ‘and might happened others, even hobbits I known.’ ‘I can’t believe Gollum connected hobbits, however distantly,’ said Frodo heat. ‘What abominable notion!’ ‘It true same,’ replied Gandalf. ‘About origins, rate, I know hobbits themselves. And even Bilbo’s story suggests kinship. There great deal background minds memories similar. They understood one another remarkably well, much better hobbit would understand, say, Dwarf, Orc, even Elf. Think riddles knew, one thing.’ ‘Yes,’ said Frodo. ‘Though folks besides hobbits ask riddles, much sort. And hobbits don’t cheat. Gollum meant cheat time. He trying put poor Bilbo guard. And I daresay amused wickedness start game might end providing easy victim, lost would hurt him.’ ‘Only true, I fear,’ said Gandalf. ‘But something else it, I think, don’t see yet. Even Gollum wholly ruined. He proved tougher even one Wise would guessed – hobbit might. There little corner mind still own, light came it, chink dark: light past. It actually pleasant, I think, hear kindly voice again, bringing memories wind, trees, sun grass, forgotten things. ‘But that, course, would make evil part angrier end – unless could conquered. Unless could cured.’ Gandalf sighed. ‘Alas! little hope him. Yet hope. No, though possessed Ring long, almost far back remember. For long since worn much: black darkness seldom needed. Certainly never ‘‘faded’’. He thin tough still. But thing eating mind, course, torment become almost unbearable. ‘All ‘‘great secrets’’ mountains turned empty night: nothing find out, nothing worth doing, nasty furtive eating resentful remembering. He altogether wretched. He hated dark, hated light more: hated everything, Ring all.’ ‘What mean?’ said Frodo. ‘Surely Ring Precious thing cared for? But hated it, didn’t get rid it, go away leave it?’ ‘You ought begin understand, Frodo, heard,’ said Gandalf. ‘He hated loved it, hated loved himself. He could get rid it. He left matter. ‘A Ring Power looks itself, Frodo. It may slip treacherously, keeper never abandons it. At plays idea handing someone else’s care – early stage, first begins grip. But far I know Bilbo alone history ever gone beyond playing, really done it. He needed help, too. And even would never forsaken it, cast aside. It Gollum, Frodo, Ring decided things. The Ring left him.’ ‘What, time meet Bilbo?’ said Frodo. ‘Wouldn’t Orc suited better?’ ‘It laughing matter,’ said Gandalf. ‘Not you. It strangest event whole history Ring far: Bilbo’s arrival time, putting hand it, blindly, dark. ‘There one power work, Frodo. The Ring trying get back master. It slipped Isildur’s hand betrayed him; chance came caught poor De´agol, murdered; Gollum, devoured him. It could make use him: small mean; long stayed would never leave deep pool again. So now, master awake sending dark thought Mirkwood, abandoned Gollum. Only picked unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo Shire! ‘Behind something else work, beyond design Ring-maker. I put plainer saying Bilbo meant find Ring, maker. In case also meant it. And may encouraging thought.’ ‘It not,’ said Frodo. ‘Though I sure I understand you. But learned Ring, Gollum? Do really know all, guessing still?’ Gandalf looked Frodo, eyes glinted. ‘I knew much I learned much,’ answered. ‘But I going give account doings you. The history Elendil Isildur One Ring known Wise. Your ring shown One Ring firewriting alone, apart evidence.’ ‘And discover that?’ asked Frodo, interrupting. ‘Just room, course,’ answered wizard sharply. ‘But I expected find it. I come back dark journeys long search make final test. It last proof, clear. Making Gollum’s part, fitting gap history, required thought. I may started guesses Gollum, I guessing now. I know. I seen him.’ ‘You seen Gollum?’ exclaimed Frodo amazement. ‘Yes. The obvious thing do, course, one could. I tried long ago; I managed last.’ ‘Then happened Bilbo escaped him? Do know that?’ ‘Not clearly. What I told Gollum willing tell – though not, course, way I reported it. Gollum liar, sift words. For instance, called Ring ‘‘birthday-present’’, stuck that. He said came grandmother, lots beautiful things kind. A ridiculous story. I doubt Sme´agol’s grandmother matriarch, great person way, talk possessing many Elven-rings absurd, giving away, lie. But lie grain truth. ‘The murder De´agol haunted Gollum, made defence, repeating ‘‘Precious’’ again, gnawed bones dark, almost believed it. It birthday. De´agol ought given ring him. It obviously turned present. It birthday-present, on, on. ‘I endured long I could, truth desperately important, end I harsh. I put fear fire him, wrung true story him, bit bit, together much snivelling snarling. He thought misunderstood ill-used. But last told history, far end Riddle-game Bilbo’s escape, would say more, except dark hints. Some fear greater mine. He muttered going get back. People would see would stand kicked, driven hole robbed. Gollum good friends now, good friends strong. They would help him. Baggins would pay it. That chief thought. He hated Bilbo cursed name. What more, knew came from.’ ‘But find out?’ asked Frodo. ‘Well, name, Bilbo foolishly told Gollum himself; would difficult discover country, Gollum came out. Oh yes, came out. His longing Ring proved stronger fear Orcs, even light. After year two left mountains. You see, though still bound desire it, Ring longer devouring him; began revive little. He felt old, terribly old, yet less timid, mortally hungry. ‘Light, light Sun Moon, still feared hated, always will, I think; cunning. He found could hide daylight moonshine, make way swiftly softly dead night pale cold eyes, catch small frightened unwary things. He grew stronger bolder new food new air. He found way Mirkwood, one would expect.’ ‘Is found him?’ asked Frodo. ‘I saw there,’ answered Gandalf, ‘but wandered far, following Bilbo’s trail. It difficult learn anything certain, talk constantly interrupted curses threats. ‘‘What got pocketses?’’ said. ‘‘It wouldn’t say, precious. Little cheat. Not fair question. It cheated first, did. It broke rules. We ought squeezed it, yes precious. And will, precious!’’ ‘That sample talk. I don’t suppose want more. I weary days it. But hints dropped among snarls I gathered padding feet taken last Esgaroth, even streets Dale, listening secretly peering. Well, news great events went far wide Wilderland, many heard Bilbo’s name knew came from. We made secret return journey home West. Gollum’s sharp ears would soon learn wanted.’ ‘Then didn’t track Bilbo further?’ asked Frodo. ‘Why didn’t come Shire?’ ‘Ah,’ said Gandalf, ‘now come it. I think Gollum tried to. He set came back westward, far Great River. But turned aside. He daunted distance, I sure. No, something else drew away. So friends think, hunted me. ‘The Wood-elves tracked first, easy task them, trail still fresh then. Through Mirkwood back led them, though never caught him. The wood full rumour him, dreadful tales even among beasts birds. The Woodmen said new terror abroad, ghost drank blood. It climbed trees find nests; crept holes find young; slipped windows find cradles. ‘But western edge Mirkwood trail turned away. It wandered southwards passed Wood-elves’ ken, lost. And I made great mistake. Yes, Frodo, first; though I fear may prove worst. I let matter be. I let go; I much else think time, I still trusted lore Saruman. ‘Well, years ago. I paid since many dark dangerous days. The trail long cold I took again, Bilbo left here. And search would vain, help I friend: Aragorn, greatest traveller huntsman age world. Together sought Gollum whole length Wilderland, without hope, without success. But last, I given chase turned paths, Gollum found. My friend returned great perils bringing miserable creature him. ‘What would say. He wept called us cruel, many gollum throat; pressed whined cringed, rubbed long hands, licking fingers pained him, remembered old torture. But I afraid possible doubt: made slow, sneaking way, step step, mile mile, south, last Land Mordor.’ A heavy silence fell room. Frodo could hear heart beating. Even outside everything seemed still. No sound Sam’s shears could heard. ‘Yes, Mordor,’ said Gandalf. ‘Alas! Mordor draws wicked things, Dark Power bending gather there. The Ring Enemy would leave mark, too, leave open summons. And folk whispering new Shadow South, hatred West. There fine new friends, would help revenge! ‘Wretched fool! In land would learn much, much comfort. And sooner later lurked pried borders would caught, taken – examination. That way it, I fear. When found already long, way back. On errand mischief. But matter much now. His worst mischief done. ‘Yes, alas! Enemy learned One found again. He knows Isildur fell. He knows Gollum found ring. He knows Great Ring, gave long life. He knows one Three, never lost, endure evil. He knows one Seven, Nine, accounted for. He knows One. And last heard, I think, hobbits Shire. ‘The Shire – may seeking now, already found lies. Indeed, Frodo, I fear may even think long-unnoticed name Baggins become important.’ ‘But terrible!’ cried Frodo. ‘Far worse worst I imagined hints warnings. O Gandalf, best friends, I do? For I really afraid. What I do? What pity Bilbo stab vile creature, chance!’ ‘Pity? It Pity stayed hand. Pity, Mercy: strike without need. And well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure took little hurt evil, escaped end, began ownership Ring so. With Pity.’ ‘I sorry,’ said Frodo. ‘But I frightened; I feel pity Gollum.’ ‘You seen him,’ Gandalf broke in. ‘No, I don’t want to,’ said Frodo. ‘I can’t understand you. Do mean say you, Elves, let live horrible deeds? Now rate bad Orc, enemy. He deserves death.’ ‘Deserves it! I daresay does. Many live deserve death. And die deserve life. Can give them? Then eager deal death judgement. For even wise cannot see ends. I much hope Gollum cured dies, chance it. And bound fate Ring. My heart tells part play yet, good ill, end; comes, pity Bilbo may rule fate many – least. In case kill him: old wretched. The Wood-elves prison, treat kindness find wise hearts.’ ‘All same,’ said Frodo, ‘even Bilbo could kill Gollum, I wish kept Ring. I wish never found it, I got it! Why let keep it? Why didn’t make throw away, or, destroy it?’ ‘Let you? Make you?’ said wizard. ‘Haven’t listening I said? You thinking saying. But throwing away, obviously wrong. These Rings way found. In evil hands might done great evil. Worst all, might fallen hands Enemy. Indeed certainly would; One, exerting power find draw himself. ‘Of course, dear Frodo, dangerous you; troubled deeply. But much stake I take risk – though even I far away never day Shire guarded watchful eyes. As long never used it, I think Ring would lasting effect you, evil, rate long time. And must remember nine years ago, I last saw you, I still knew little certain.’ ‘But destroy it, say done long ago?’ cried Frodo again. ‘If warned me, even sent message, I would done away it.’ ‘Would you? How would that? Have ever tried?’ ‘No. But I suppose one could hammer melt it.’ ‘Try!’ said Gandalf. ‘Try now!’ Frodo drew Ring pocket looked it. It appeared plain smooth, without mark device could see. The gold looked fair pure, Frodo thought rich beautiful colour, perfect roundness. It admirable thing altogether precious. When took intended fling hottest part fire. But found could so, without great struggle. He weighed Ring hand, hesitating, forcing remember Gandalf told him; effort made movement, cast away – found put back pocket. Gandalf laughed grimly. ‘You see? Already too, Frodo, cannot easily let go, damage it. And I could ‘‘make’’ – except force, would break mind. But breaking Ring, force useless. Even took struck heavy sledge-hammer, would make dint it. It cannot unmade hands, mine. ‘Your small fire, course, would melt even ordinary gold. This Ring already passed unscathed, even unheated. But smith’s forge Shire could change all. Not even anvils furnaces Dwarves could that. It said dragon-fire could melt consume Rings Power, dragon left earth old fire hot enough; ever dragon, even Ancalagon Black, could harmed One Ring, Ruling Ring, made Sauron himself. ‘There one way: find Cracks Doom depths Orodruin, Fire-mountain, cast Ring there, really wish destroy it, put beyond grasp Enemy ever.’ ‘I really wish destroy it!’ cried Frodo. ‘Or, well, destroyed. I made perilous quests. I wish I never seen Ring! Why come me? Why I chosen?’ ‘Such questions cannot answered,’ said Gandalf. ‘You may sure merit others possess: power wisdom, rate. But chosen, must therefore use strength heart wits have.’ ‘But I little things! You wise powerful. Will take Ring?’ ‘No!’ cried Gandalf, springing feet. ‘With power I power great terrible. And Ring would gain power still greater deadly.’ His eyes flashed face lit fire within. ‘Do tempt me! For I wish become like Dark Lord himself. Yet way Ring heart pity, pity weakness desire strength good. Do tempt me! I dare take it, even keep safe, unused. The wish wield would great strength. I shall need it. Great perils lie me.’ He went window drew aside curtains shutters. Sunlight streamed back room. Sam passed along path outside whistling. ‘And now,’ said wizard, turning back Frodo, ‘the decision lies you. But I always help you.’ He laid hand Frodo’s shoulder. ‘I help bear burden, long bear. But must something, soon. The Enemy moving.’ There long silence. Gandalf sat puffed pipe, lost thought. His eyes seemed closed, lids watching Frodo intently. Frodo gazed fixedly red embers hearth, filled vision, seemed looking profound wells fire. He thinking fabled Cracks Doom terror Fiery Mountain. ‘Well!’ said Gandalf last. ‘What thinking about? Have decided do?’ ‘No!’ answered Frodo, coming back darkness, finding surprise dark, window could see sunlit garden. ‘Or perhaps, yes. As far I understand said, I suppose I must keep Ring guard it, least present, whatever may me.’ ‘Whatever may do, slow, slow evil, keep purpose,’ said Gandalf. ‘I hope so,’ said Frodo. ‘But I hope may find better keeper soon. But meanwhile seems I danger, danger live near me. I cannot keep Ring stay here. I ought leave Bag End, leave Shire, leave everything go away.’ He sighed. ‘I like save Shire, I could – though times I thought inhabitants stupid dull words, felt earthquake invasion dragons might good them. But I don’t feel like now. I feel long Shire lies behind, safe comfortable, I shall find wandering bearable: I shall know somewhere firm foothold, even feet cannot stand again. ‘Of course, I sometimes thought going away, I imagined kind holiday, series adventures like Bilbo’s better, ending peace. But would mean exile, flight danger danger, drawing me. And I suppose I must go alone, I save Shire. But I feel small, uprooted, well – desperate. The Enemy strong terrible.’ He tell Gandalf, speaking great desire follow Bilbo flamed heart – follow Bilbo, even perhaps find again. It strong overcame fear: could almost run road without hat, Bilbo done similar morning long ago. ‘My dear Frodo!’ exclaimed Gandalf. ‘Hobbits really amazing creatures, I said before. You learn know ways month, yet hundred years still surprise pinch. I hardly expected get answer, even you. But Bilbo made mistake choosing heir, though little thought important would prove. I afraid right. The Ring able stay hidden Shire much longer; sake, well others, go, leave name Baggins behind you. That name safe have, outside Shire Wild. I give travelling name now. When go, go Mr. Underhill. ‘But I don’t think need go alone. Not know anyone trust, would willing go side – would willing take unknown perils. But look companion, careful choosing! And careful say, even closest friends! The enemy many spies many ways hearing.’ Suddenly stopped listening. Frodo became aware quiet, inside outside. Gandalf crept one side window. Then dart sprang sill, thrust long arm downwards. There squawk, came Sam Gamgee’s curly head hauled one ear. ‘Well, well, bless beard!’ said Gandalf. ‘Sam Gamgee it? Now may doing?’ ‘Lor bless you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!’ said Sam. ‘Nothing! Leastways I trimming grass-border window, follow me.’ He picked shears exhibited evidence. ‘I don’t,’ said Gandalf grimly. ‘It time since I last heard sound shears. How long eavesdropping?’ ‘Eavesdropping, sir? I don’t follow you, begging pardon. There ain’t eaves Bag End, that’s fact.’ ‘Don’t fool! What heard, listen?’ Gandalf’s eyes flashed brows stuck like bristles. ‘Mr. Frodo, sir!’ cried Sam quaking. ‘Don’t let hurt me, sir! Don’t let turn anything unnatural! My old dad would take so. I meant harm, honour, sir!’ ‘He won’t hurt you,’ said Frodo, hardly able keep laughing, although startled rather puzzled. ‘He knows, well I do, mean harm. But answer questions straight away!’ ‘Well, sir,’ said Sam dithering little. ‘I heard deal I didn’t rightly understand, enemy, rings, Mr. Bilbo, sir, dragons, fiery mountain, – Elves, sir. I listened I couldn’t help myself, know I mean. Lor bless me, sir, I love tales sort. And I believe too, whatever Ted may say. Elves, sir! I would dearly love see them. Couldn’t take see Elves, sir, go?’ Suddenly Gandalf laughed. ‘Come inside!’ shouted, putting arms lifted astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippings all, right window stood floor. ‘Take see Elves, eh?’ said, eyeing Sam closely, smile flickering face. ‘So heard Mr. Frodo going away?’ ‘I did, sir. And that’s I choked: heard seemingly. I tried to, sir, burst me: I upset.’ ‘It can’t helped, Sam,’ said Frodo sadly. He suddenly realized flying Shire would mean painful partings merely saying farewell familiar comforts Bag End. ‘I shall go. But’ – looked hard Sam – ‘if really care me, keep dead secret. See? If don’t, even breathe word you’ve heard here, I hope Gandalf turn spotted toad fill garden full grasssnakes.’ Sam fell knees, trembling. ‘Get up, Sam!’ said Gandalf. ‘I thought something better that. Something shut mouth, punish properly listening. You shall go away Mr. Frodo!’ ‘Me, sir!’ cried Sam, springing like dog invited walk. ‘Me go see Elves all! Hooray!’ shouted, burst tears. Chapter 3 THREE IS COMPANY ‘You ought go quietly, ought go soon,’ said Gandalf. Two three weeks passed, still Frodo made sign getting ready go. ‘I know. But difficult both,’ objected. ‘If I vanish like Bilbo, tale Shire time.’ ‘Of course mustn’t vanish!’ said Gandalf. ‘That wouldn’t all! I said soon, instantly. If think way slipping Shire without generally known, worth little delay. But must delay long.’ ‘What autumn, Our Birthday?’ asked Frodo. ‘I think I could probably make arrangements then.’ To tell truth, reluctant start, come point: Bag End seemed desirable residence years, wanted savour much could last summer Shire. When autumn came, knew part least heart would think kindly journeying, always season. He indeed privately made mind leave fiftieth birthday: Bilbo’s one hundred twentyeighth. It seemed somehow proper day set follow him. Following Bilbo uppermost mind, one thing made thought leaving bearable. He thought little possible Ring, might lead end. But tell thoughts Gandalf. What wizard guessed always difficult tell. He looked Frodo smiled. ‘Very well,’ said. ‘I think – must later. I getting anxious. In meanwhile, take care, don’t let hint going! And see Sam Gamgee talk. If does, I really shall turn toad.’ ‘As I going,’ said Frodo, ‘it would difficult give away, I clear idea myself, yet.’ ‘Don’t absurd!’ said Gandalf. ‘I warning leaving address post-office! But leaving Shire – known, far away. And must go, least set out, either North, South, West East – direction certainly known.’ ‘I taken thoughts leaving Bag End, saying farewell, I never even considered direction,’ said Frodo. ‘For I go? And shall I steer? What quest? Bilbo went find treasure, back again; I go lose one, return, far I see.’ ‘But cannot see far,’ said Gandalf. ‘Neither I. It may task find Cracks Doom; quest may others: I know. At rate ready long road yet.’ ‘No indeed!’ said Frodo. ‘But meantime course I take?’ ‘Towards danger; rashly, straight,’ answered wizard. ‘If want advice, make Rivendell. That journey prove perilous, though Road less easy was, grow worse year fails.’ ‘Rivendell!’ said Frodo. ‘Very good: I go east, I make Rivendell. I take Sam visit Elves; delighted.’ He spoke lightly; heart moved suddenly desire see house Elrond Halfelven, breathe air deep valley many Fair Folk still dwelt peace. One summer’s evening astonishing piece news reached Ivy Bush Green Dragon. Giants portents borders Shire forgotten important matters: Mr. Frodo selling Bag End, indeed already sold – Sackville-Bagginses! ‘For nice bit, too,’ said some. ‘At bargain price,’ said others, ‘and that’s likely Mistress Lobelia’s buyer.’ (Otho died years before, ripe disappointed age 102.) Just Mr. Frodo selling beautiful hole even debatable price. A held theory – supported nods hints Mr. Baggins – Frodo’s money running out: going leave Hobbiton live quiet way proceeds sale Buckland among Brandybuck relations. ‘As far Sackville-Bagginses may be,’ added. But firmly fixed notion immeasurable wealth Bagginses Bag End become found hard believe, harder reason unreason fancy could suggest: suggested dark yet unrevealed plot Gandalf. Though kept quiet go day, well known ‘hiding Bag End’. But however removal might fit designs wizardry, doubt fact: Frodo Baggins going back Buckland. ‘Yes, I shall moving autumn,’ said. ‘Merry Brandybuck looking nice little hole me, perhaps small house.’ As matter fact Merry’s help already chosen bought little house Crickhollow country beyond Bucklebury. To Sam pretended going settle permanently. The decision set eastwards suggested idea him; Buckland eastern borders Shire, lived childhood going back would least seem credible. Gandalf stayed Shire two months. Then one evening, end June, soon Frodo’s plan finally arranged, suddenly announced going next morning. ‘Only short while, I hope,’ said. ‘But I going beyond southern borders get news, I can. I idle longer I should.’ He spoke lightly, seemed Frodo looked rather worried. ‘Has anything happened?’ asked. ‘Well no; I heard something made anxious needs looking into. If I think necessary get once, I shall come back immediately, least send word. In meanwhile stick plan; careful ever, especially Ring. Let impress more: don’t use it!’ He went dawn. ‘I may back day,’ said. ‘At latest I shall come back farewell party. I think may need company Road.’ At first Frodo good deal disturbed, wondered often Gandalf could heard; uneasiness wore off, fine weather forgot troubles while. The Shire seldom seen fair summer, rich autumn: trees laden apples, honey dripping combs, corn tall full. Autumn well way Frodo began worry Gandalf again. September passing still news him. The Birthday, removal, drew nearer, still come, send word. Bag End began busy. Some Frodo’s friends came stay help packing: Fredegar Bolger Folco Boffin, course special friends Pippin Took Merry Brandybuck. Between turned whole place upside-down. On September 20th two covered carts went laden Buckland, conveying furniture goods Frodo sold new home, way Brandywine Bridge.The next day Frodo became really anxious, kept constant look-out Gandalf. Thursday, birthday morning, dawned fair clear long ago Bilbo’s great party. Still Gandalf appear. In evening Frodo gave farewell feast: quite small, dinner four helpers; troubled felt mood it. The thought would soon part young friends weighed heart. He wondered would break them. The four younger hobbits were, however, high spirits, party soon became cheerful spite Gandalf’s absence. The dining-room bare except table chairs, food good, good wine: Frodo’s wine included sale Sackville-Bagginses. ‘Whatever happens rest stuff, S.-B.s get claws it, rate I found good home this!’ said Frodo, drained glass. It last drop Old Winyards. When sung many songs, talked many things done together, toasted Bilbo’s birthday, drank health Frodo’s together according Frodo’s custom. Then went sniff air, glimpse stars, went bed. Frodo’s party over, Gandalf come. The next morning busy packing another cart remainder luggage. Merry took charge this, drove Fatty (that Fredegar Bolger). ‘Someone must get warm house arrive,’ said Merry. ‘Well, see later – day tomorrow, don’t go sleep way!’ Folco went home lunch, Pippin remained behind. Frodo restless anxious, listening vain sound Gandalf. He decided wait nightfall. After that, Gandalf wanted urgently, would go Crickhollow, might even get first. For Frodo going foot. His plan – pleasure last look Shire much reason – walk Hobbiton Bucklebury Ferry, taking fairly easy. ‘I shall get bit training, too,’ said, looking dusty mirror half-empty hall. He done strenuous walking long time, reflection looked rather flabby, thought. After lunch, Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia sandy-haired son, Lotho, turned up, much Frodo’s annoyance. ‘Ours last!’ said Lobelia, stepped inside. It polite; strictly true, sale Bag End take effect midnight. But Lobelia perhaps forgiven: obliged wait seventy-seven years longer Bag End hoped, hundred years old. Anyway, come see nothing paid carried off; wanted keys. It took long satisfy her, brought complete inventory went right it. In end departed Lotho spare key promise key would left Gamgees’ Bagshot Row. She snorted, showed plainly thought Gamgees capable plundering hole night. Frodo offer tea. He took tea Pippin Sam Gamgee kitchen. It officially announced Sam coming Buckland ‘to Mr. Frodo look bit garden’; arrangement approved Gaffer, though console prospect Lobelia neighbour. ‘Our last meal Bag End!’ said Frodo, pushing back chair. They left washing Lobelia. Pippin Sam strapped three packs piled porch. Pippin went last stroll garden. Sam disappeared. The sun went down. Bag End seemed sad gloomy dishevelled. Frodo wandered round familiar rooms, saw light sunset fade walls, shadows creep corners. It grew slowly dark indoors. He went walked gate bottom path, short way Hill Road. He half expected see Gandalf come striding dusk. The sky clear stars growing bright. ‘It’s going fine night,’ said aloud. ‘That’s good beginning. I feel like walking. I can’t bear hanging about. I going start, Gandalf must follow me.’ He turned go back, stopped, heard voices, round corner end Bagshot Row. One voice certainly old Gaffer’s; strange, somehow unpleasant. He could make said, heard Gaffer’s answers, rather shrill. The old man seemed put out. ‘No, Mr. Baggins gone away. Went morning, Sam went him: anyway stuff went. Yes, sold gone, I tell’ee. Why? Why’s none business, yours. Where to? That ain’t secret. He’s moved Bucklebury place, away yonder. Yes – tidy way. I’ve never far myself; they’re queer folks Buckland. No, I can’t give message. Good night you!’ Footsteps went away Hill. Frodo wondered vaguely fact come Hill seemed great relief. ‘I sick questions curiosity doings, I suppose,’ thought. ‘What inquisitive lot are!’ He half mind go ask Gaffer inquirer was; thought better (or worse) it, turned walked quickly back Bag End. Pippin sitting pack porch. Sam there. Frodo stepped inside dark door. ‘Sam!’ called. ‘Sam! Time!’ ‘Coming, sir!’ came answer far within, followed soon Sam himself, wiping mouth. He saying farewell beer-barrel cellar. ‘All aboard, Sam?’ said Frodo. ‘Yes, sir. I’ll last bit now, sir.’ Frodo shut locked round door, gave key Sam. ‘Run home, Sam!’ said. ‘Then cut along Row meet us quick gate lane beyond meadows. We going village tonight. Too many ears pricking eyes prying.’ Sam ran full speed. ‘Well, we’re last!’ said Frodo. They shouldered packs took sticks, walked round corner west side Bag End. ‘Good-bye!’ said Frodo, looking dark blank windows. He waved hand, turned (following Bilbo, known it) hurried Peregrin garden-path. They jumped low place hedge bottom took fields, passing darkness like rustle grasses. At bottom Hill western side came gate opening narrow lane. There halted adjusted straps packs. Presently Sam appeared, trotting quickly breathing hard; heavy pack hoisted high shoulders, put head tall shapeless felt bag, called hat. In gloom looked much like dwarf. ‘I sure given heaviest stuff,’ said Frodo. ‘I pity snails, carry homes backs.’ ‘I could take lot yet, sir. My packet quite light,’ said Sam stoutly untruthfully. ‘No don’t, Sam!’ said Pippin. ‘It good him. He’s got nothing except ordered us pack. He’s slack lately, he’ll feel weight less he’s walked own.’ ‘Be kind poor old hobbit!’ laughed Frodo. ‘I shall thin willow-wand, I’m sure, I get Buckland. But I talking nonsense. I suspect taken share, Sam, I shall look next packing.’ He picked stick again. ‘Well, like walking dark,’ said, ‘so let’s put miles behind us bed.’ For short way followed lane westwards. Then leaving turned left took quietly fields again. They went single file along hedgerows borders coppices, night fell dark them. In dark cloaks invisible magic rings. Since hobbits, trying silent, made noise even hobbits would hear. Even wild things fields woods hardly noticed passing. After time crossed Water, west Hobbiton, narrow plank-bridge. The stream winding black ribbon, bordered leaning alder-trees. A mile two south hastily crossed great road Brandywine Bridge; Tookland bending south-eastwards made Green Hill Country. As began climb first slopes looked back saw lamps Hobbiton far twinkling gentle valley Water. Soon disappeared folds darkened land, followed Bywater beside grey pool. When light last farm far behind, peeping among trees, Frodo turned waved hand farewell. ‘I wonder I shall ever look valley again,’ said quietly. When walked three hours rested. The night clear, cool, starry, smoke-like wisps mist creeping hill-sides streams deep meadows. Thin-clad birches, swaying light wind heads, made black net pale sky. They ate frugal supper (for hobbits), went again. Soon struck narrow road, went rolling down, fading grey darkness ahead: road Woodhall, Stock, Bucklebury Ferry. It climbed away main road Water-valley, wound skirts Green Hills towards Woody End, wild corner Eastfarthing. After plunged deeply cloven track tall trees rustled dry leaves night. It dark. At first talked, hummed tune softly together, far away inquisitive ears. Then marched silence, Pippin began lag behind. At last, began climb steep slope, stopped yawned. ‘I sleepy,’ said, ‘that soon I shall fall road. Are going sleep legs? It nearly midnight.’ ‘I thought liked walking dark,’ said Frodo. ‘But great hurry. Merry expects us time day tomorrow; leaves us nearly two days more. We’ll halt first likely spot.’ ‘The wind’s West,’ said Sam. ‘If get side hill, shall find spot sheltered snug enough, sir. There dry fir-wood ahead, I remember rightly.’ Sam knew land well within twenty miles Hobbiton, limit geography. Just top hill came patch fir-wood. Leaving road went deep resinscented darkness trees, gathered dead sticks cones make fire. Soon merry crackle flame foot large fir-tree sat round while, began nod. Then, angle great tree’s roots, curled cloaks blankets, soon fast asleep. They set watch; even Frodo feared danger yet, still heart Shire. A creatures came looked fire died away. A fox passing wood business stopped several minutes sniffed. ‘Hobbits!’ thought. ‘Well, next? I heard strange doings land, I seldom heard hobbit sleeping doors tree. Three them! There’s something mighty queer behind this.’ He quite right, never found it. The morning came, pale clammy. Frodo woke first, found tree-root made hole back, neck stiff. ‘Walking pleasure! Why didn’t I drive?’ thought, usually beginning expedition. ‘And beautiful feather beds sold Sackville-Bagginses! These tree-roots would good.’ He stretched. ‘Wake up, hobbits!’ cried. ‘It’s beautiful morning.’ ‘What’s beautiful it?’ said Pippin, peering edge blanket one eye. ‘Sam! Get breakfast ready half-past nine! Have got bath-water hot?’ Sam jumped up, looking rather bleary. ‘No, sir, I haven’t, sir!’ said. Frodo stripped blankets Pippin rolled over, walked edge wood. Away eastward sun rising red mists lay thick world. Touched gold red autumn trees seemed sailing rootless shadowy sea. A little left road ran steeply hollow disappeared. When returned Sam Pippin got good fire going. ‘Water!’ shouted Pippin. ‘Where’s water?’ ‘I don’t keep water pockets,’ said Frodo. ‘We thought gone find some,’ said Pippin, busy setting food, cups. ‘You better go now.’ ‘You come too,’ said Frodo, ‘and bring waterbottles.’ There stream foot hill. They filled bottles small camping kettle little fall water fell feet outcrop grey stone. It icy cold; spluttered puffed bathed faces hands. When breakfast over, packs trussed again, ten o’clock, day beginning turn fine hot. They went slope, across stream dived road, next slope, another shoulder hills; time cloaks, blankets, water, food, gear already seemed heavy burden. The day’s march promised warm tiring work. After miles, however, road ceased roll down: climbed top steep bank weary zig-zagging sort way, prepared go last time. In front saw lower lands dotted small clumps trees melted away distance brown woodland haze. They looking across Woody End towards Brandywine River. The road wound away like piece string. ‘The road goes ever,’ said Pippin; ‘but I can’t without rest. It high time lunch.’ He sat bank side road looked away east haze, beyond lay River, end Shire spent life. Sam stood him. His round eyes wide open – looking across lands never seen new horizon. ‘Do Elves live woods?’ asked. ‘Not I ever heard,’ said Pippin. Frodo silent. He gazing eastward along road, never seen before. Suddenly spoke, aloud himself, saying slowly: The Road goes ever Down door began. Now far ahead Road gone, And I must follow, I can, Pursuing weary feet, Until joins larger way, Where many paths errands meet. And whither then? I cannot say. ‘That sounds like bit old Bilbo’s rhyming,’ said Pippin. ‘Or one imitations? It sound altogether encouraging.’ ‘I don’t know,’ said Frodo. ‘It came then, I making up; I may heard long ago. Certainly reminds much Bilbo last years, went away. He used often say one Road; like great river: springs every doorstep, every path tributary. ‘‘It’s dangerous business, Frodo, going door,’’ used say. ‘‘You step Road, don’t keep feet, knowing might swept to. Do realize path goes Mirkwood, let it, might take Lonely Mountain even worse places?’’ He used say path outside front door Bag End, especially long walk.’ ‘Well, Road won’t sweep anywhere hour least,’ said Pippin, unslinging pack. The others followed example, putting packs bank legs road. After rest good lunch, rest. The sun beginning get low light afternoon land went hill. So far met soul road. This way much used, hardly fit carts, little traffic Woody End. They jogging along hour Sam stopped moment listening. They level ground, road much winding lay straight ahead grass-land sprinkled tall trees, outliers approaching woods. ‘I hear pony horse coming along road behind,’ said Sam. They looked back, turn road prevented seeing far. ‘I wonder Gandalf coming us,’ said Frodo; even said it, feeling so, sudden desire hide view rider came him. ‘It may matter much,’ said apologetically, ‘but I would rather seen road – anyone. I sick doings noticed discussed. And Gandalf,’ added afterthought, ‘we give little surprise, pay late. Let’s get sight!’ The two ran quickly left little hollow far road. There lay flat. Frodo hesitated second: curiosity feeling struggling desire hide. The sound hoofs drew nearer. Just time threw patch long grass behind tree overshadowed road. Then lifted head peered cautiously one great roots. Round corner came black horse, hobbit-pony full-sized horse; sat large man, seemed crouch saddle, wrapped great black cloak hood, boots high stirrups showed below; face shadowed invisible. When reached tree level Frodo horse stopped. The riding figure sat quite still head bowed, listening. From inside hood came noise someone sniffing catch elusive scent; head turned side side road. A sudden unreasoning fear discovery laid hold Frodo, thought Ring. He hardly dared breathe, yet desire get pocket became strong began slowly move hand. He felt slip on, would safe. The advice Gandalf seemed absurd. Bilbo used Ring. ‘And I still Shire,’ thought, hand touched chain hung. At moment rider sat up, shook reins. The horse stepped forward, walking slowly first, breaking quick trot. Frodo crawled edge road watched rider, dwindled distance. He could quite sure, seemed suddenly, passed sight, horse turned aside went trees right. ‘Well, I call queer, indeed disturbing,’ said Frodo himself, walked towards companions. Pippin Sam remained flat grass, seen nothing; Frodo described rider strange behaviour. ‘I can’t say why, I felt certain looking smelling me; also I felt certain I want discover me. I’ve never seen felt anything like Shire before.’ ‘But one Big People got us?’ said Pippin. ‘And part world?’ ‘There Men about,’ said Frodo. ‘Down Southfarthing trouble Big People, I believe. But I never heard anything like rider. I wonder comes from.’ ‘Begging pardon,’ put Sam suddenly, ‘I know comes from. It’s Hobbiton black rider comes, unless there’s one. And I know he’s going to.’ ‘What mean?’ said Frodo sharply, looking astonishment. ‘Why didn’t speak before?’ ‘I remembered, sir. It like this: I got back hole yesterday evening key, dad, says me: Hallo, Sam! says. I thought away Mr. Frodo morning. There’s strange customer asking Mr. Baggins Bag End, he’s gone. I’ve sent Bucklebury. Not I liked sound him. He seemed mighty put out, I told Mr. Baggins left old home good. Hissed me, did. It gave quite shudder. What sort fellow he? says I Gaffer. I don’t know, says he; wasn’t hobbit. He tall black-like, stooped me. I reckon one Big Folk foreign parts. He spoke funny. ‘I couldn’t stay hear more, sir, since waiting; I didn’t give much heed myself. The Gaffer getting old, bit blind, must near dark fellow come Hill found taking air end Row. I hope hasn’t done harm, sir, me.’ ‘The Gaffer can’t blamed anyway,’ said Frodo. ‘As matter fact I heard talking stranger, seemed inquiring me, I nearly went asked was. I wish I had, told before. I might careful road.’ ‘Still, may connexion rider Gaffer’s stranger,’ said Pippin. ‘We left Hobbiton secretly enough, I don’t see could followed us.’ ‘What smelling, sir?’ said Sam. ‘And Gaffer said black chap.’ ‘I wish I waited Gandalf,’ Frodo muttered. ‘But perhaps would made matters worse.’ ‘Then know guess something rider?’ said Pippin, caught muttered words. ‘I don’t know, I would rather guess,’ said Frodo. ‘All right, cousin Frodo! You keep secret present, want mysterious. In meanwhile do? I like bite sup, somehow I think better move here. Your talk sniffing riders invisible noses unsettled me.’ ‘Yes, I think move now,’ said Frodo; ‘but road – case rider comes back, another follows him. We ought good step today. Buckland still miles away.’ The shadows trees long thin grass, started again. They kept stone’s throw left road, kept sight much could. But hindered them; grass thick tussocky, ground uneven, trees began draw together thickets. The sun gone red behind hills backs, evening coming came back road end long level run straight miles. At point bent left went lowlands Yale making Stock; lane branched right, winding wood ancient oak-trees way Woodhall. ‘That way us,’ said Frodo. Not far road-meeting came huge hulk tree: still alive leaves small branches put round broken stumps long-fallen limbs; hollow, could entered great crack side away road. The hobbits crept inside, sat upon floor old leaves decayed wood. They rested light meal, talking quietly listening time time. Twilight crept back lane. The West wind sighing branches. Leaves whispering. Soon road began fall gently steadily dusk. A star came trees darkening East them. They went abreast step, keep spirits. After time, stars grew thicker brighter, feeling disquiet left them, longer listened sound hoofs. They began hum softly, hobbits way walk along, especially drawing near home night. With hobbits supper-song bed-song; hobbits hummed walking-song (though not, course, without mention supper bed). Bilbo Baggins made words, tune old hills, taught Frodo walked lanes Water-valley talked Adventure. Upon hearth fire red, Beneath roof bed; But yet weary feet, Still round corner may meet A sudden tree standing stone That none seen alone. Tree flower leaf grass, Let pass! Let pass! Hill water sky, Pass by! Pass by! Still round corner may wait A new road secret gate, And though pass today, Tomorrow may come way And take hidden paths run Towards Moon Sun. Apple, thorn, nut sloe, Let go! Let go! Sand stone pool dell, Fare well! Fare well! Home behind, world ahead, And many paths tread Through shadows edge night, Until stars alight. Then world behind home ahead, We’ll wander back home bed. Mist twilight, cloud shade, Away shall fade! Away shall fade! Fire lamp, meat bread, And bed! And bed! The song ended. ‘And bed! And bed!’ sang Pippin high voice. ‘Hush!’ said Frodo. ‘I think I hear hoofs again.’ They stopped suddenly stood silent treeshadows, listening. There sound hoofs lane, way behind, coming slow clear wind. Quickly quietly slipped path, ran deeper shade oak-trees. ‘Don’t let us go far!’ said Frodo. ‘I don’t want seen, I want see another Black Rider.’ ‘Very well!’ said Pippin. ‘But don’t forget sniffing!’ The hoofs drew nearer. They time find hiding-place better general darkness trees; Sam Pippin crouched behind large tree-bole, Frodo crept back yards towards lane. It showed grey pale, line fading light wood. Above stars thick dim sky, moon. The sound hoofs stopped. As Frodo watched saw something dark pass across lighter space two trees, halt. It looked like black shade horse led smaller black shadow. The black shadow stood close point left path, swayed side side. Frodo thought heard sound snuffling. The shadow bent ground, began crawl towards him. Once desire slip Ring came Frodo; time stronger before. So strong that, almost realized doing, hand groping pocket. But moment came sound like mingled song laughter. Clear voices rose fell starlit air. The black shadow straightened retreated. It climbed shadowy horse seemed vanish across lane darkness side. Frodo breathed again. ‘Elves!’ exclaimed Sam hoarse whisper. ‘Elves, sir!’ He would burst trees dashed towards voices, pulled back. ‘Yes, Elves,’ said Frodo. ‘One meet sometimes Woody End. They don’t live Shire, wander spring autumn, lands away beyond Tower Hills. I thankful do! You see, Black Rider stopped actually crawling towards us song began. As soon heard voices slipped away.’ ‘What Elves?’ said Sam, excited trouble rider. ‘Can’t go see them?’ ‘Listen! They coming way,’ said Frodo. ‘We wait.’ The singing drew nearer. One clear voice rose others. It singing fair elven-tongue, Frodo knew little, others knew nothing. Yet sound blending melody seemed shape thought words partly understood. This song Frodo heard it: Snow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear! O Queen beyond Western Seas! O Light us wander Amid world woven trees! Gilthoniel! O Elbereth! Clear thy eyes bright thy breath! Snow-white! Snow-white! We sing thee In far land beyond Sea. O stars Sunless Year With shining hand sown, In windy fields bright clear We see silver blossom blown! O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! We still remember, dwell In far land beneath trees, Thy starlight Western Seas. The song ended. ‘These High Elves! They spoke name Elbereth!’ said Frodo amazement. ‘Few fairest folk ever seen Shire. Not many remain Middle-earth, east Great Sea. This indeed strange chance!’ The hobbits sat shadow wayside. Before long Elves came lane towards valley. They passed slowly, hobbits could see starlight glimmering hair eyes. They bore lights, yet walked shimmer, like light moon rim hills rises, seemed fall feet. They silent, last Elf passed turned looked towards hobbits laughed. ‘Hail, Frodo!’ cried. ‘You abroad late. Or perhaps lost?’ Then called aloud others, company stopped gathered round. ‘This indeed wonderful!’ said. ‘Three hobbits wood night! We seen thing since Bilbo went away. What meaning it?’ ‘The meaning it, fair people,’ said Frodo, ‘is simply seem going way are. I like walking stars. But I would welcome company.’ ‘But need company, hobbits dull,’ laughed. ‘And know go way you, know whither going?’ ‘And know name?’ asked Frodo return. ‘We know many things,’ said. ‘We seen often Bilbo, though may seen us.’ ‘Who you, lord?’ asked Frodo. ‘I Gildor,’ answered leader, Elf first hailed him. ‘Gildor Inglorion House Finrod. We Exiles, kindred long ago departed tarrying while, ere return Great Sea. But kinsfolk dwell still peace Rivendell. Come now, Frodo, tell us doing? For see shadow fear upon you.’ ‘O Wise People!’ interrupted Pippin eagerly. ‘Tell us Black Riders!’ ‘Black Riders?’ said low voices. ‘Why ask Black Riders?’ ‘Because two Black Riders overtaken us today, one done twice,’ said Pippin; ‘only little ago slipped away drew near.’ The Elves answer once, spoke together softly tongue. At length Gildor turned hobbits. ‘We speak here,’ said. ‘We think best come us. It custom, time take road, shall lodge us tonight, will.’ ‘O Fair Folk! This good fortune beyond hope,’ said Pippin. Sam speechless. ‘I thank indeed, Gildor Inglorion,’ said Frodo bowing. ‘Elen sı´la lu´menn’ omentielvo, star shines hour meeting,’ added High-elven speech. ‘Be careful, friends!’ cried Gildor laughing. ‘Speak secrets! Here scholar Ancient Tongue. Bilbo good master. Hail, Elf-friend!’ said, bowing Frodo. ‘Come friends join company! You best walk middle may stray. You may weary halt.’ ‘Why? Where going?’ asked Frodo. ‘For tonight go woods hills Woodhall. It miles, shall rest end it, shorten journey tomorrow.’ They marched silence, passed like shadows faint lights: Elves (even hobbits) could walk wished without sound footfall. Pippin soon began feel sleepy, staggered twice; time tall Elf side put arm saved fall. Sam walked along Frodo’s side, dream, expression face half fear half astonished joy. The woods either side became denser; trees younger thicker; lane went lower, running fold hills, many deep brakes hazel rising slopes either hand. At last Elves turned aside path. A green ride lay almost unseen thickets right; followed wound away back wooded slopes top shoulder hills stood lower land river-valley. Suddenly came shadow trees, lay wide space grass, grey night. On three sides woods pressed upon it; eastward ground fell steeply tops dark trees, growing bottom slope, feet. Beyond, low lands lay dim flat stars. Nearer hand lights twinkled village Woodhall. The Elves sat grass spoke together soft voices; seemed take notice hobbits. Frodo companions wrapped cloaks blankets, drowsiness stole them. The night grew on, lights valley went out. Pippin fell asleep, pillowed green hillock. Away high East swung Remmirath, Netted Stars, slowly mists red Borgil rose, glowing like jewel fire. Then shift airs mist drawn away like veil, leaned up, climbed rim world, Swordsman Sky, Menelvagor shining belt. The Elves burst song. Suddenly trees fire sprang red light. ‘Come!’ Elves called hobbits. ‘Come! Now time speech merriment!’ Pippin sat rubbed eyes. He shivered. ‘There fire hall, food hungry guests,’ said Elf standing him. At south end greensward opening. There green floor ran wood, formed wide space like hall, roofed boughs trees. Their great trunks ran like pillars side. In middle wood-fire blazing, upon tree-pillars torches lights gold silver burning steadily. The Elves sat round fire upon grass upon sawn rings old trunks. Some went fro bearing cups pouring drink; others brought food heaped plates dishes. ‘This poor fare,’ said hobbits; ‘for lodging greenwood far halls. If ever guests home, treat better.’ ‘It seems good enough birthday-party,’ said Frodo. Pippin afterwards recalled little either food drink, mind filled light upon elf-faces, sound voices various beautiful felt waking dream. But remembered bread, surpassing savour fair white loaf one starving; fruits sweet wildberries richer tended fruits gardens; drained cup filled fragrant draught, cool clear fountain, golden summer afternoon. Sam could never describe words, picture clearly himself, felt thought night, though remained memory one chief events life. The nearest ever got say: ‘Well, sir, I could grow apples like that, I would call gardener. But singing went heart, know I mean.’ Frodo sat, eating, drinking, talking delight; mind chiefly words spoken. He knew little elf-speech listened eagerly. Now spoke served thanked language. They smiled said laughing: ‘Here jewel among hobbits!’ After Pippin fell fast asleep, lifted borne away bower trees; laid upon soft bed slept rest night away. Sam refused leave master. When Pippin gone, came sat curled Frodo’s feet, last nodded closed eyes. Frodo remained long awake, talking Gildor. They spoke many things, old new, Frodo questioned Gildor much happenings wide world outside Shire. The tidings mostly sad ominous: gathering darkness, wars Men, flight Elves. At last Frodo asked question nearest heart: ‘Tell me, Gildor, ever seen Bilbo since left us?’ Gildor smiled. ‘Yes,’ answered. ‘Twice. He said farewell us spot. But I saw again, far here.’ He would say Bilbo, Frodo fell silent. ‘You ask tell much concerns yourself, Frodo,’ said Gildor. ‘But I already know little, I read face thought behind questions. You leaving Shire, yet doubt find seek, accomplish intend, ever return. Is so?’ ‘It is,’ said Frodo; ‘but I thought going secret known Gandalf faithful Sam.’ He looked Sam, snoring gently. ‘The secret reach Enemy us,’ said Gildor. ‘The Enemy?’ said Frodo. ‘Then know I leaving Shire?’ ‘I know reason Enemy pursuing you,’ answered Gildor; ‘but I perceive – strange indeed though seems me. And I warn peril behind you, upon either side.’ ‘You mean Riders? I feared servants Enemy. What Black Riders?’ ‘Has Gandalf told nothing?’ ‘Nothing creatures.’ ‘Then I think say – lest terror keep journey. For seems set time, indeed time. You must make haste, neither stay turn back; Shire longer protection you.’ ‘I cannot imagine information could terrifying hints warnings,’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘I knew danger lay ahead, course; I expect meet Shire. Can’t hobbit walk Water River peace?’ ‘But Shire,’ said Gildor. ‘Others dwelt hobbits were; others dwell hobbits more. The wide world you: fence in, cannot ever fence out.’ ‘I know – yet always seemed safe familiar. What I now? My plan leave Shire secretly, make way Rivendell; footsteps dogged, ever I get Buckland.’ ‘I think still follow plan,’ said Gildor. ‘I think Road prove hard courage. But desire clearer counsel, ask Gandalf. I know reason flight, therefore I know means pursuers assail you. These things Gandalf must know. I suppose see leave Shire?’ ‘I hope so. But another thing makes anxious. I expecting Gandalf many days. He come Hobbiton latest two nights ago; never appeared. Now I wondering happened. Should I wait him?’ Gildor silent moment. ‘I like news,’ said last. ‘That Gandalf late, bode well. But said: Do meddle affairs Wizards, subtle quick anger. The choice yours: go wait.’ ‘And also said,’ answered Frodo: ‘Go Elves counsel, say yes.’ ‘Is indeed?’ laughed Gildor. ‘Elves seldom give unguarded advice, advice dangerous gift, even wise wise, courses may run ill. But would you? You told concerning yourself; shall I choose better you? But demand advice, I friendship’s sake give it. I think go once, without delay; Gandalf come set out, I also advise this: go alone. Take friends trusty willing. Now grateful, I give counsel gladly. The Elves labours sorrows, little concerned ways hobbits, creatures upon earth. Our paths cross seldom, chance purpose. In meeting may chance; purpose clear me, I fear say much.’ ‘I deeply grateful,’ said Frodo; ‘but I wish would tell plainly Black Riders are. If I take advice I may see Gandalf long while, I ought know danger pursues me.’ ‘Is enough know servants Enemy?’ answered Gildor. ‘Flee them! Speak words them! They deadly. Ask me! But heart forbodes that, ere ended, you, Frodo son Drogo, know fell things Gildor Inglorion. May Elbereth protect you!’ ‘But shall I find courage?’ asked Frodo. ‘That I chiefly need.’ ‘Courage found unlikely places,’ said Gildor. ‘Be good hope! Sleep now! In morning shall gone; send messages lands. The Wandering Companies shall know journey, power good shall watch. I name Elf-friend; may stars shine upon end road! Seldom delight strangers, fair hear words Ancient Speech lips wanderers world.’ Frodo felt sleep coming upon him, even Gildor finished speaking. ‘I sleep now,’ said; Elf led bower beside Pippin, threw upon bed fell dreamless slumber. Chapter 4 A SHORT CUT TO MUSHROOMS In morning Frodo woke refreshed. He lying bower made living tree branches laced drooping ground; bed fern grass, deep soft strangely fragrant. The sun shining fluttering leaves, still green upon tree. He jumped went out. Sam sitting grass near edge wood. Pippin standing studying sky weather. There sign Elves. ‘They left us fruit drink, bread,’ said Pippin. ‘Come breakfast. The bread tastes almost good last night. I want leave any, Sam insisted.’ Frodo sat beside Sam began eat. ‘What plan today?’ asked Pippin. ‘To walk Bucklebury quickly possible,’ answered Frodo, gave attention food. ‘Do think shall see anything Riders?’ asked Pippin cheerfully. Under morning sun prospect seeing whole troop seem alarming him. ‘Yes, probably,’ said Frodo, liking reminder. ‘But I hope get across river without seeing us.’ ‘Did find anything Gildor?’ ‘Not much – hints riddles,’ said Frodo evasively. ‘Did ask sniffing?’ ‘We didn’t discuss it,’ said Frodo mouth full. ‘You have. I sure important.’ ‘In case I sure Gildor would refused explain it,’ said Frodo sharply. ‘And leave peace bit! I don’t want answer string questions I eating. I want think!’ ‘Good heavens!’ said Pippin. ‘At breakfast?’ He walked away towards edge green. From Frodo’s mind bright morning – treacherously bright, thought – banished fear pursuit; pondered words Gildor. The merry voice Pippin came him. He running green turf singing. ‘No! I could not!’ said himself. ‘It one thing take young friends walking Shire me, hungry weary, food bed sweet. To take exile, hunger weariness may cure, quite another – even willing come. The inheritance mine alone. I don’t think I ought even take Sam.’ He looked Sam Gamgee, discovered Sam watching him. ‘Well, Sam!’ said. ‘What it? I leaving Shire soon ever I – fact I made mind even wait day Crickhollow, helped.’ ‘Very good, sir!’ ‘You still mean come me?’ ‘I do.’ ‘It going dangerous, Sam. It already dangerous. Most likely neither us come back.’ ‘If don’t come back, sir, I shan’t, that’s certain,’ said Sam. ‘Don’t leave him! said me. Leave him! I said. I never mean to. I going him, climbs Moon; Black Riders try stop him, they’ll Sam Gamgee reckon with, I said. They laughed.’ ‘Who they, talking about?’ ‘The Elves, sir. We talk last night; seemed know going away, I didn’t see use denying it. Wonderful folk, Elves, sir! Wonderful!’ ‘They are,’ said Frodo. ‘Do like still, closer view?’ ‘They seem bit likes dislikes, speak,’ answered Sam slowly. ‘It don’t seem matter I think them. They quite different I expected – old young, gay sad, were.’ Frodo looked Sam rather startled, half expecting see outward sign odd change seemed come him. It sound like voice old Sam Gamgee thought knew. But looked like old Sam Gamgee sitting there, except face unusually thoughtful. ‘Do feel need leave Shire – wish see come true already?’ asked. ‘Yes, sir. I don’t know say it, last night I feel different. I seem see ahead, kind way. I know going take long road, darkness; I know I can’t turn back. It isn’t see Elves now, dragons, mountains, I want – I don’t rightly know I want: I something end, lies ahead, Shire. I must see through, sir, understand me.’ ‘I don’t altogether. But I understand Gandalf chose good companion. I content. We go together.’ Frodo finished breakfast silence. Then standing looked land ahead, called Pippin. ‘All ready start?’ said Pippin ran up. ‘We must getting once. We slept late; good many miles go.’ ‘You slept late, mean,’ said Pippin. ‘I long before; waiting finish eating thinking.’ ‘I finished now. And I going make Bucklebury Ferry quickly possible. I going way, back road left last night: I going cut straight across country here.’ ‘Then going fly,’ said Pippin. ‘You won’t cut straight foot anywhere country.’ ‘We cut straighter road anyway,’ answered Frodo. ‘The Ferry east Woodhall; hard road curves away left – see bend away north there. It goes round north end Marish strike causeway Bridge Stock. But miles way. We could save quarter distance made line Ferry stand.’ ‘Short cuts make long delays,’ argued Pippin. ‘The country rough round here, bogs kinds difficulties Marish – I know land parts. And worrying Black Riders, I can’t see worse meeting road wood field.’ ‘It less easy find people woods fields,’ answered Frodo. ‘And supposed road, chance looked road it.’ ‘All right!’ said Pippin. ‘I follow every bog ditch. But hard! I counted passing Golden Perch Stock sundown. The best beer Eastfarthing, used be: long time since I tasted it.’ ‘That settles it!’ said Frodo. ‘Short cuts make delays, inns make longer ones. At costs must keep away Golden Perch. We want get Bucklebury dark. What say, Sam?’ ‘I go along you, Mr. Frodo,’ said Sam (in spite private misgivings deep regret best beer Eastfarthing). ‘Then going toil bog briar, let’s go now!’ said Pippin. It already nearly hot day before; clouds beginning come West. It looked likely turn rain. The hobbits scrambled steep green bank plunged thick trees below. Their course chosen leave Woodhall left, cut slanting woods clustered along eastern side hills, reached flats beyond. Then could make straight Ferry country open, except ditches fences. Frodo reckoned eighteen miles go straight line. He soon found thicket closer tangled appeared. There paths undergrowth, get fast. When struggled bottom bank, found stream running hills behind deeply dug bed steep slippery sides overhung brambles. Most inconveniently cut across line chosen. They could jump it, indeed get across without getting wet, scratched, muddy. They halted, wondering do. ‘First check!’ said Pippin, smiling grimly. Sam Gamgee looked back. Through opening trees caught glimpse top green bank climbed down. ‘Look!’ said, clutching Frodo arm. They looked, edge high saw sky horse standing. Beside stooped black figure. They gave idea going back. Frodo led way, plunged quickly thick bushes beside stream. ‘Whew!’ said Pippin. ‘We right! The short cut gone crooked already; got cover time. You’ve got sharp ears, Sam: hear anything coming?’ They stood still, almost holding breath listened; sound pursuit. ‘I don’t fancy would try bringing horse bank,’ said Sam. ‘But I guess knows came it. We better going on.’ Going altogether easy. They packs carry, bushes brambles reluctant let through. They cut wind ridge behind, air still stuffy. When forced way last open ground, hot tired scratched, also longer certain direction going. The banks stream sank, reached levels became broader shallower, wandering towards Marish River. ‘Why, Stock-brook!’ said Pippin. ‘If going try get back course, must cross bear right.’ They waded stream, hurried wide open space, rush-grown treeless, side. Beyond came belt trees: tall oaks, part, elm tree ash. The ground fairly level, little undergrowth; trees close see far ahead. The leaves blew upwards sudden gusts wind, spots rain began fall overcast sky. Then wind died away rain came streaming down. They trudged along fast could, patches grass, thick drifts old leaves; rain pattered trickled. They talk, kept glancing back, side side. After half hour Pippin said: ‘I hope turned much towards south, walking longwise wood! It broad belt – I said mile widest – ought now.’ ‘It good starting go zig-zags,’ said Frodo. ‘That won’t mend matters. Let us keep going! I sure I want come open yet.’ They went perhaps another couple miles. Then sun gleamed ragged clouds rain lessened. It past mid-day, felt high time lunch. They halted elm tree: leaves though fast turning yellow still thick, ground feet fairly dry sheltered. When came make meal, found Elves filled bottles clear drink, pale golden colour: scent honey made many flowers, wonderfully refreshing. Very soon laughing, snapping fingers rain, Black Riders. The last miles, felt, would soon behind them. Frodo propped back tree-trunk, closed eyes. Sam Pippin sat near, began hum, sing softly: Ho! Ho! Ho! bottle I go To heal heart drown woe. Rain may fall wind may blow, And many miles still go, But tall tree I lie, And let clouds go sailing by. Ho! Ho! Ho! began louder. They stopped short suddenly. Frodo sprang feet. A long-drawn wail came wind, like cry evil lonely creature. It rose fell, ended high piercing note. Even sat stood, suddenly frozen, answered another cry, fainter off, less chilling blood. There silence, broken sound wind leaves. ‘And think was?’ Pippin asked last, trying speak lightly, quavering little. ‘If bird, one I never heard Shire before.’ ‘It bird beast,’ said Frodo. ‘It call, signal – words cry, though I could catch them. But hobbit voice.’ No said it. They thinking Riders, one spoke them. They reluctant either stay go on; sooner later got get across open country Ferry, best go sooner daylight. In moments shouldered packs off. Before long wood came sudden end. Wide grasslands stretched them. They saw had, fact, turned much south. Away flats could glimpse low hill Bucklebury across River, left. Creeping cautiously edge trees, set across open quickly could. At first felt afraid, away shelter wood. Far back behind stood high place breakfasted. Frodo half expected see small distant figure horseman ridge dark sky; sign one. The sun escaping breaking clouds, sank towards hills left, shining brightly again. Their fear left them, though still felt uneasy. But land became steadily tame well-ordered. Soon came well-tended fields meadows: hedges gates dikes drainage. Everything seemed quiet peaceful, ordinary corner Shire. Their spirits rose every step. The line River grew nearer; Black Riders began seem like phantoms woods left far behind. They passed along edge huge turnip-field, came stout gate. Beyond rutted lane ran low well-laid hedges towards distant clump trees. Pippin stopped. ‘I know fields gate!’ said. ‘This Bamfurlong, old Farmer Maggot’s land. That’s farm away trees.’ ‘One trouble another!’ said Frodo, looking nearly much alarmed Pippin declared lane slot leading dragon’s den. The others looked surprise. ‘What’s wrong old Maggot?’ asked Pippin. ‘He’s good friend Brandybucks. Of course he’s terror trespassers, keeps ferocious dogs – all, folk near border guard.’ ‘I know,’ said Frodo. ‘But same,’ added shamefaced laugh, ‘I terrified dogs. I avoided farm years years. He caught several times trespassing mushrooms, I youngster Brandy Hall. On last occasion beat me, took showed dogs. ‘‘See, lads,’’ said, ‘‘next time young varmint sets foot land, eat him. Now see off!’’ They chased way Ferry. I never got fright – though I daresay beasts knew business would really touched me.’ Pippin laughed. ‘Well, it’s time made up. Especially coming back live Buckland. Old Maggot really stout fellow – leave mushrooms alone. Let’s get lane shan’t trespassing. If meet him, I’ll talking. He friend Merry’s, I used come good deal one time.’ They went along lane, saw thatched roofs large house farm-buildings peeping among trees ahead. The Maggots, Puddifoots Stock, inhabitants Marish, house-dwellers; farm stoutly built brick high wall round it. There wide wooden gate opening wall lane. Suddenly drew nearer terrific baying barking broke out, loud voice heard shouting: ‘Grip! Fang! Wolf! Come on, lads!’ Frodo Sam stopped dead, Pippin walked paces. The gate opened three huge dogs came pelting lane, dashed towards travellers, barking fiercely. They took notice Pippin; Sam shrank wall, two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed suspiciously, snarled moved. The largest ferocious three halted front Frodo, bristling growling. Through gate appeared broad thick-set hobbit round red face. ‘Hallo! Hallo! And may be, may wanting?’ asked. ‘Good afternoon, Mr. Maggot!’ said Pippin. The farmer looked closely. ‘Well, isn’t Master Pippin – Mr. Peregrin Took, I say!’ cried, changing scowl grin. ‘It’s long time since I saw round here. It’s lucky I know you. I going set dogs strangers. There funny things going today. Of course, get queer folk wandering parts times. Too near River,’ said, shaking head. ‘But fellow outlandish I ever set eyes on. He won’t cross land without leave second time, I stop it.’ ‘What fellow mean?’ asked Pippin. ‘Then haven’t seen him?’ said farmer. ‘He went lane towards causeway long back. He funny customer asking funny questions. But perhaps you’ll come along inside, we’ll pass news comfortable. I’ve drop good ale tap, friends willing, Mr. Took.’ It seemed plain farmer would tell more, allowed time fashion, accepted invitation. ‘What dogs?’ asked Frodo anxiously. The farmer laughed. ‘They won’t harm – unless I tell ’em to. Here, Grip! Fang! Heel!’ cried. ‘Heel, Wolf!’ To relief Frodo Sam, dogs walked away let go free. Pippin introduced two farmer. ‘Mr. Frodo Baggins,’ said. ‘You may remember him, used live Brandy Hall.’ At name Baggins farmer started, gave Frodo sharp glance. For moment Frodo thought memory stolen mushrooms aroused, dogs would told see off. But Farmer Maggot took arm. ‘Well, isn’t queerer ever!’ exclaimed. ‘Mr. Baggins it? Come inside! We must talk.’ They went farmer’s kitchen, sat wide fire-place. Mrs. Maggot brought beer huge jug, filled four large mugs. It good brew, Pippin found compensated missing Golden Perch. Sam sipped beer suspiciously. He natural mistrust inhabitants parts Shire; also disposed quick friends anyone beaten master, however long ago. After remarks weather agricultural prospects (which worse usual), Farmer Maggot put mug looked turn. ‘Now, Mr. Peregrin,’ said, ‘where might coming from, might going to? Were coming visit me? For, so, gone past gate without seeing you.’ ‘Well, no,’ answered Pippin. ‘To tell truth, since guessed it, got lane end: come fields. But quite accident. We lost way woods, back near Woodhall, trying take short cut Ferry.’ ‘If hurry, road would served better,’ said farmer. ‘But I wasn’t worrying that. You leave walk land, mind, Mr. Peregrin. And you, Mr. Baggins – though I daresay still like mushrooms.’ He laughed. ‘Ah yes, I recognized name. I recollect time young Frodo Baggins one worst young rascals Buckland. But wasn’t mushrooms I thinking of. I heard name Baggins turned up. What think funny customer asked me?’ They waited anxiously go on. ‘Well,’ farmer continued, approaching point slow relish, ‘he came riding big black horse gate, happened open, right door. All black himself, too, cloaked hooded up, want known. ‘‘Now Shire want?’’ I thought myself. We don’t see many Big Folk border; anyway I never heard like black fellow. ‘‘‘Good-day you!’’ I says, going him. ‘‘This lane don’t lead anywhere, wherever may going, quickest way back road.’’ I didn’t like looks him; Grip came out, took one sniff let yelp stung: put tail bolted howling. The black fellow sat quite still. ‘‘‘I come yonder,’’ said, slow stiff-like, pointing back west, fields, please. ‘‘Have seen Baggins?’’ asked queer voice, bent towards me. I could see face, hood fell low; I felt sort shiver back. But I see come riding land bold. ‘‘‘Be off!’’ I said. ‘‘There Bagginses here. You’re wrong part Shire. You better go back west Hobbiton – go road time.’’ ‘‘‘Baggins left,’’ answered whisper. ‘‘He coming. He far away. I wish find him. If passes tell me? I come back gold.’’ ‘‘‘No won’t,’’ I said. ‘‘You’ll go back belong, double quick. I give one minute I call dogs.’’ ‘He gave sort hiss. It might laughing, might not. Then spurred great horse right me, I jumped way time. I called dogs, swung off, rode gate lane towards causeway like bolt thunder. What think that?’ Frodo sat moment looking fire, thought earth would reach Ferry. ‘I don’t know think,’ said last. ‘Then I’ll tell think,’ said Maggot. ‘You never gone mixing Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo. Folk queer there.’ Sam stirred chair, looked farmer unfriendly eye. ‘But always reckless lad. When I heard left Brandybucks gone old Mr. Bilbo, I said going find trouble. Mark words, comes strange doings Mr. Bilbo’s. His money got strange fashion foreign parts, say. Maybe want know become gold jewels buried hill Hobbiton, I hear?’ Frodo said nothing: shrewd guesses farmer rather disconcerting. ‘Well, Mr. Frodo,’ Maggot went on, ‘I’m glad you’ve sense come back Buckland. My advice is: stay there! And don’t get mixed outlandish folk. You’ll friends parts. If black fellows come again, I’ll deal them. I’ll say you’re dead, left Shire, anything like. And might true enough; like old Mr. Bilbo want news of.’ ‘Maybe you’re right,’ said Frodo, avoiding farmer’s eye staring fire. Maggot looked thoughtfully. ‘Well, I see ideas own,’ said. ‘It plain nose accident brought rider afternoon; maybe news great news you, all. I asking tell anything mind keep yourself; I see kind trouble. Perhaps thinking won’t easy get Ferry without caught?’ ‘I thinking so,’ said Frodo. ‘But got try get there; won’t done sitting thinking. So I afraid must going. Thank much indeed kindness! I’ve terror dogs thirty years, Farmer Maggot, though may laugh hear it. It’s pity: I’ve missed good friend. And I’m sorry leave soon. But I’ll come back, perhaps, one day – I get chance.’ ‘You’ll welcome come,’ said Maggot. ‘But I’ve notion. It’s near sundown already, going supper; mostly go bed soon Sun. If Mr. Peregrin could stay bite us, would pleased!’ ‘And we!’ said Frodo. ‘But must going once, I’m afraid. Even dark reach Ferry.’ ‘Ah! wait minute! I going say: bit supper, I’ll get small waggon, I’ll drive Ferry. That save good step, might also save trouble another sort.’ Frodo accepted invitation gratefully, relief Pippin Sam. The sun already behind western hills, light failing. Two Maggot’s sons three daughters came in, generous supper laid large table. The kitchen lit candles fire mended. Mrs. Maggot bustled out. One two hobbits belonging farm-household came in. In short fourteen sat eat. There beer plenty, mighty dish mushrooms bacon, besides much solid farmhouse fare. The dogs lay fire gnawed rinds cracked bones. When finished, farmer sons went lantern got waggon ready. It dark yard, guests came out. They threw packs board climbed in. The farmer sat driving-seat, whipped two stout ponies. His wife stood light open door. ‘You careful yourself, Maggot!’ called. ‘Don’t go arguing foreigners, come straight back!’ ‘I will!’ said he, drove gate. There breath wind stirring; night still quiet, chill air. They went without lights took slowly. After mile two lane came end, crossing deep dike, climbing short slope highbanked causeway. Maggot got took good look either way, north south, nothing could seen darkness, sound still air. Thin strands river-mist hanging dikes, crawling fields. ‘It’s going thick,’ said Maggot; ‘but I’ll light lanterns till I turn home. We’ll hear anything road long meet tonight.’ * * * It five miles Maggot’s lane Ferry. The hobbits wrapped up, ears strained sound creak wheels slow clop ponies’ hoofs. The waggon seemed slower snail Frodo. Beside Pippin nodding towards sleep; Sam staring forwards rising fog. They reached entrance Ferry lane last. It marked two tall white posts suddenly loomed right. Farmer Maggot drew ponies waggon creaked halt. They beginning scramble out, suddenly heard dreading: hoofs road ahead. The sound coming towards them. Maggot jumped stood holding ponies’ heads, peering forward gloom. Clip-clop, clip-clop came approaching rider. The fall hoofs sounded loud still, foggy air. ‘You’d better hidden, Mr. Frodo,’ said Sam anxiously. ‘You get waggon cover blankets, we’ll send rider rightabouts!’ He climbed went farmer’s side. Black Riders would ride get near waggon. Clop-clop, clop-clop. The rider nearly them. ‘Hallo there!’ called Farmer Maggot. The advancing hoofs stopped short. They thought could dimly guess dark cloaked shape mist, yard two ahead. ‘Now then!’ said farmer, throwing reins Sam striding forward. ‘Don’t come step nearer! What want, going?’ ‘I want Mr. Baggins. Have seen him?’ said muffled voice – voice voice Merry Brandybuck. A dark lantern uncovered, light fell astonished face farmer. ‘Mr. Merry!’ cried. ‘Yes, course! Who think was?’ said Merry coming forward. As came mist fears subsided, seemed suddenly diminish ordinary hobbitsize. He riding pony, scarf swathed round neck chin keep fog. Frodo sprang waggon greet him. ‘So last!’ said Merry. ‘I beginning wonder would turn today, I going back supper. When grew foggy I came across rode towards Stock see fallen ditches. But I’m blest I know way come. Where find them, Mr. Maggot? In duck-pond?’ ‘No, I caught ’em trespassing,’ said farmer, ‘and nearly set dogs ’em; they’ll tell story, I’ve doubt. Now, you’ll excuse me, Mr. Merry Mr. Frodo all, I’d best turning home. Mrs. Maggot worriting night getting thick.’ He backed waggon lane turned it. ‘Well, good night all,’ said. ‘It’s queer day, mistake. But all’s well ends well; though perhaps say reach doors. I’ll deny I’ll glad I do.’ He lit lanterns, got up. Suddenly produced large basket seat. ‘I nearly forgetting,’ said. ‘Mrs. Maggot put Mr. Baggins, compliments.’ He handed moved off, followed chorus thanks good-nights. They watched pale rings light round lanterns dwindled foggy night. Suddenly Frodo laughed: covered basket held, scent mushrooms rising. Chapter 5 A CONSPIRACY UNMASKED ‘Now better get home ourselves,’ said Merry. ‘There’s something funny this, I see; must wait till get in.’ They turned Ferry lane, straight well-kept edged large white-washed stones. In hundred yards brought river-bank, broad wooden landing-stage. A large flat ferryboat moored beside it. The white bollards near water’s edge glimmered light two lamps high posts. Behind mists flat fields hedges; water dark, curling wisps like steam among reeds bank. There seemed less fog side. Merry led pony gangway ferry, others followed. Merry pushed slowly long pole. The Brandywine flowed slow broad them. On side bank steep, winding path climbed landing. Lamps twinkling there. Behind loomed Buck Hill; it, stray shrouds mist, shone many round windows, yellow red. They windows Brandy Hall, ancient home Brandybucks. Long ago Gorhendad Oldbuck, head Oldbuck family, one oldest Marish indeed Shire, crossed river, original boundary land eastwards. He built (and excavated) Brandy Hall, changed name Brandybuck, settled become master virtually small independent country. His family grew grew, days continued grow, Brandy Hall occupied whole low hill, three large front-doors, many side-doors, hundred windows. The Brandybucks numerous dependants began burrow, later build, round about. That origin Buckland, thickly inhabited strip river Old Forest, sort colony Shire. Its chief village Bucklebury, clustering banks slopes behind Brandy Hall. The people Marish friendly Bucklanders, authority Master Hall (as head Brandybuck family called) still acknowledged farmers Stock Rushey. But folk old Shire regarded Bucklanders peculiar, half foreigners were. Though, matter fact, different hobbits Four Farthings. Except one point: fond boats, could swim. Their land originally unprotected East; side built hedge: High Hay. It planted many generations ago, thick tall, constantly tended. It ran way Brandywine Bridge, big loop curving away river, Haysend (where Withywindle flowed Forest Brandywine): well twenty miles end end. But, course, complete protection. The Forest drew close hedge many places. The Bucklanders kept doors locked dark, also usual Shire. The ferry-boat moved slowly across water. The Buckland shore drew nearer. Sam member party river before. He strange feeling slow gurgling stream slipped by: old life lay behind mists, dark adventure lay front. He scratched head, moment passing wish Mr. Frodo could gone living quietly Bag End. The four hobbits stepped ferry. Merry tying up, Pippin already leading pony path, Sam (who looking back, take farewell Shire) said hoarse whisper: ‘Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do see anything?’ On far stage, distant lamps, could make figure: looked like dark black bundle left behind. But looked seemed move sway way that, searching ground. It crawled, went crouching, back gloom beyond lamps. ‘What Shire that?’ exclaimed Merry. ‘Something following us,’ said Frodo. ‘But don’t ask now! Let’s get away once!’ They hurried path top bank, looked back far shore shrouded mist, nothing could seen. ‘Thank goodness don’t keep boats westbank!’ said Frodo. ‘Can horses cross river?’ ‘They go ten miles north Brandywine Bridge – might swim,’ answered Merry. ‘Though I never heard horse swimming Brandywine. But horses it?’ ‘I’ll tell later. Let’s get indoors talk.’ ‘All right! You Pippin know way; I’ll ride tell Fatty Bolger coming. We’ll see supper things.’ ‘We supper early Farmer Maggot,’ said Frodo; ‘but could another.’ ‘You shall it! Give basket!’ said Merry, rode ahead darkness. It distance Brandywine Frodo’s new house Crickhollow. They passed Buck Hill Brandy Hall left, outskirts Bucklebury struck main road Buckland ran south Bridge. Half mile northward along came lane opening right. This followed couple miles climbed country. At last came narrow gate thick hedge. Nothing could seen house dark: stood back lane middle wide circle lawn surrounded belt low trees inside outer hedge. Frodo chosen it, stood out-of-the-way corner country, dwellings close by. You could get without noticed. It built long Brandybucks, use guests, members family wished escape crowded life Brandy Hall time. It oldfashioned countrified house, much like hobbit-hole possible: long low, upper storey; roof turf, round windows, large round door. As walked green path gate light visible; windows dark shuttered. Frodo knocked door, Fatty Bolger opened it. A friendly light streamed out. They slipped quickly shut light inside. They wide hall doors either side; front passage ran back middle house. ‘Well, think it?’ asked Merry coming passage. ‘We done best short time make look like home. After Fatty I got last cart-load yesterday.’ Frodo looked round. It look like home. Many favourite things – Bilbo’s things (they reminded sharply new setting) – arranged nearly possible Bag End. It pleasant, comfortable, welcoming place; found wishing really coming settle quiet retirement. It seemed unfair put friends trouble; wondered going break news must leave soon, indeed once. Yet would done night, went bed. ‘It’s delightful!’ said effort. ‘I hardly feel I moved all.’ * * * The travellers hung cloaks, piled packs floor. Merry led passage threw open door far end. Firelight came out, puff steam. ‘A bath!’ cried Pippin. ‘O blessed Meriadoc!’ ‘Which order shall go in?’ said Frodo. ‘Eldest first, quickest first? You’ll last either way, Master Peregrin.’ ‘Trust arrange things better that!’ said Merry. ‘We can’t begin life Crickhollow quarrel baths. In room three tubs, copper full boiling water. There also towels, mats soap. Get inside, quick!’ Merry Fatty went kitchen side passage, busied final preparations late supper. Snatches competing songs came bathroom mixed sound splashing wallowing. The voice Pippin suddenly lifted others one Bilbo’s favourite bath-songs. Sing hey! bath close day washes weary mud away! A loon sing: O! Water Hot noble thing! O! Sweet sound falling rain, brook leaps hill plain; better rain rippling streams Water Hot smokes steams. O! Water cold may pour need thirsty throat glad indeed; better Beer, drink lack, Water Hot poured back. O! Water fair leaps high fountain white beneath sky; never fountain sound sweet splashing Hot Water feet! There terrific splash, shout Whoa! Frodo. It appeared lot Pippin’s bath imitated fountain leaped high. Merry went door: ‘What supper beer throat?’ called. Frodo came drying hair. ‘There’s much water air I’m coming kitchen finish,’ said. ‘Lawks!’ said Merry, looking in. The stone floor swimming. ‘You ought mop get anything eat, Peregrin,’ said. ‘Hurry up, shan’t wait you.’ They supper kitchen table near fire. ‘I suppose three won’t want mushrooms again?’ said Fredegar without much hope. ‘Yes shall!’ cried Pippin. ‘They’re mine!’ said Frodo. ‘Given Mrs. Maggot, queen among farmers’ wives. Take greedy hands away, I’ll serve them.’ Hobbits passion mushrooms, surpassing even greediest likings Big People. A fact partly explains young Frodo’s long expeditions renowned fields Marish, wrath injured Maggot. On occasion plenty all, even according hobbit standards. There also many things follow, finished even Fatty Bolger heaved sigh content. They pushed back table, drew chairs round fire. ‘We’ll clear later,’ said Merry. ‘Now tell it! I guess adventures, quite fair without me. I want full account; I want know matter old Maggot, spoke like that. He sounded almost scared, possible.’ ‘We scared,’ said Pippin pause, Frodo stared fire speak. ‘You would been, too, chased two days Black Riders.’ ‘And they?’ ‘Black figures riding black horses,’ answered Pippin. ‘If Frodo won’t talk, I tell whole tale beginning.’ He gave full account journey time left Hobbiton. Sam gave various supporting nods exclamations. Frodo remained silent. ‘I think making up,’ said Merry, ‘if I seen black shape landing-stage – heard queer sound Maggot’s voice. What make all, Frodo?’ ‘Cousin Frodo close,’ said Pippin. ‘But time come open out. So far given nothing go Farmer Maggot’s guess something old Bilbo’s treasure.’ ‘That guess,’ said Frodo hastily. ‘Maggot know anything.’ ‘Old Maggot shrewd fellow,’ said Merry. ‘A lot goes behind round face come talk. I’ve heard used go Old Forest one time, reputation knowing good many strange things. But least tell us, Frodo, whether think guess good bad.’ ‘I think,’ answered Frodo slowly, ‘that good guess, far goes. There connexion Bilbo’s old adventures, Riders looking, perhaps one ought say searching, me. I also fear, want know, joke all; I safe anywhere else.’ He looked round windows walls, afraid would suddenly give way. The others looked silence, exchanged meaning glances among themselves. ‘It’s coming minute,’ whispered Pippin Merry. Merry nodded. ‘Well!’ said Frodo last, sitting straightening back, made decision. ‘I can’t keep dark longer. I got something tell all. But I don’t know quite begin.’ ‘I think I could help you,’ said Merry quietly, ‘by telling myself.’ ‘What mean?’ said Frodo, looking anxiously. ‘Just this, dear old Frodo: miserable, don’t know say good-bye. You meant leave Shire, course. But danger come sooner expected,andnowyouaremakingupyourmindtogoatonce. And don’t want to. We sorry you.’ Frodo opened mouth shut again. His look surprise comical laughed. ‘Dear old Frodo!’ said Pippin. ‘Did really think thrown dust eyes? You nearly careful clever enough that! You obviously planning go saying farewell haunts year since April. We constantly heard muttering: ‘‘Shall I ever look valley again, I wonder’’, things like that. And pretending come end money, actually selling beloved Bag End SackvilleBagginses! And close talks Gandalf.’ ‘Good heavens!’ said Frodo. ‘I thought I careful clever. I don’t know Gandalf would say. Is Shire discussing departure then?’ ‘Oh no!’ said Merry. ‘Don’t worry that! The secret won’t keep long, course; present is, I think, known us conspirators. After all, must remember know well, often you. We usually guess thinking. I knew Bilbo, too. To tell truth, I watching rather closely ever since left. I thought would go sooner later; indeed I expected go sooner, lately anxious. We terrified might give us slip, go suddenly, like did. Ever since spring kept eyes open, done good deal planning account. You going escape easily!’ ‘But I must go,’ said Frodo. ‘It cannot helped, dear friends. It wretched us all, use trying keep me. Since guessed much, please help hinder me!’ ‘You understand!’ said Pippin. ‘You must go – therefore must, too. Merry I coming you. Sam excellent fellow, would jump dragon’s throat save you, trip feet; need one companion dangerous adventure.’ ‘My dear beloved hobbits!’ said Frodo deeply moved. ‘But I could allow it. I decided long ago, too. You speak danger, understand. This treasure-hunt, there-and-back journey. I flying deadly peril deadly peril.’ ‘Of course understand,’ said Merry firmly. ‘That decided come. We know Ring laughing-matter; going best help Enemy.’ ‘The Ring!’ said Frodo, completely amazed. ‘Yes, Ring,’ said Merry. ‘My dear old hobbit, don’t allow inquisitiveness friends. I known existence Ring years – Bilbo went away, fact; since obviously regarded secret, I kept knowledge head, formed conspiracy. I know Bilbo, course, well I know you; I young, also careful – careful enough. If want know I first found out, I tell you.’ ‘Go on!’ said Frodo faintly. ‘ItwastheSackville-Bagginsesthatwerehisdownfall,asyou might expect. One day, year Party, I happened walking along road, I saw Bilbo ahead. Suddenly distance S.-B.s appeared, coming towards us. Bilbo slowed down, hey presto! vanished. I startled I hardly wits hide ordinary fashion; I got hedge walked along field inside. I peeping road, S.-B.s passed, looking straight Bilbo suddenly reappeared. I caught glint gold put something back trouser-pocket. ‘After I kept eyes open. In fact, I confess I spied. But must admit intriguing, I teens. I must one Shire, besides Frodo, ever seen old fellow’s secret book.’ ‘You read book!’ cried Frodo. ‘Good heavens above! Is nothing safe?’ ‘Not safe, I say,’ said Merry. ‘But I one rapid glance, difficult get. He never left book about. I wonder became it. I like another look. Have got it, Frodo?’ ‘No. It Bag End. He must taken away.’ ‘Well, I saying,’ Merry proceeded, ‘I kept knowledge myself, till spring things got serious. Then formed conspiracy; serious, too, meant business, scrupulous. You easy nut crack, Gandalf worse. But want introduced chief investigator, I produce him.’ ‘Where he?’ said Frodo, looking round, expected masked sinister figure come cupboard. ‘Step forward, Sam!’ said Merry; Sam stood face scarlet ears. ‘Here’s collector information! And collected lot, I tell you, finally caught. After which, I may say, seemed regard parole, dried up.’ ‘Sam!’ cried Frodo, feeling amazement could go further, quite unable decide whether felt angry, amused, relieved, merely foolish. ‘Yes, sir!’ said Sam. ‘Begging pardon, sir! But I meant wrong you, Mr. Frodo, Mr. Gandalf matter. He sense, mind you; said go alone, said no! take someone trust.’ ‘But seem I trust anyone,’ said Frodo. Sam looked unhappily. ‘It depends want,’ put Merry. ‘You trust us stick thick thin – bitter end. And trust us keep secret – closer keep yourself. But cannot trust us let face trouble alone, go without word. We friends, Frodo. Anyway: is. We know Gandalf told you. We know good deal Ring. We horribly afraid – coming you; following like hounds.’ ‘And all, sir,’ added Sam, ‘you ought take Elves’ advice. Gildor said take willing, can’t deny it.’ ‘I don’t deny it,’ said Frodo, looking Sam, grinning. ‘I don’t deny it, I’ll never believe sleeping again, whether snore not. I shall kick hard make sure. ‘You set deceitful scoundrels!’ said, turning others. ‘But bless you!’ laughed, getting waving arms, ‘I give in. I take Gildor’s advice. If danger dark, I dance joy. Even so, I cannot help feeling happy; happier I felt long time. I dreaded evening.’ ‘Good! That’s settled. Three cheers Captain Frodo company!’ shouted; danced round him. Merry Pippin began song, apparently got ready occasion. It made model dwarf-song started Bilbo adventure long ago, went tune: Farewell call hearth hall! Though wind may blow rain may fall, We must away ere break day Far wood mountain tall. To Rivendell, Elves yet dwell In glades beneath misty fell, Through moor waste ride haste, And whither cannot tell. With foes ahead, behind us dread, Beneath sky shall bed, Until last toil passed, Our journey done, errand sped. We must away! We must away! We ride break day! ‘Very good!’ said Frodo. ‘But case lot things go bed – roof, tonight rate.’ ‘Oh! That poetry!’ said Pippin. ‘Do really mean start break day?’ ‘I don’t know,’ answered Frodo. ‘I fear Black Riders, I sure unsafe stay one place long, especially place known I going. Also Gildor advised wait. But I much like see Gandalf. I could see even Gildor disturbed heard Gandalf never appeared. It really depends two things. How soon could Riders get Bucklebury? And soon could get off? It take good deal preparation.’ ‘The answer second question,’ said Merry, ‘is could get hour. I prepared practically everything. There five ponies stable across fields; stores tackle packed, except extra clothes, perishable food.’ ‘It seems efficient conspiracy,’ said Frodo. ‘But Black Riders? Would safe wait one day Gandalf?’ ‘That depends think Riders would do, found here,’ answered Merry. ‘They could reached now, course, stopped North-gate, Hedge runs riverbank, side Bridge. The gate-guards would let night, though might break through. Even daylight would try keep out, I think, rate got message Master Hall – would like look Riders, would certainly frightened them. But, course, Buckland cannot resist determined attack long. And possible morning even Black Rider rode asked Mr. Baggins would let through. It pretty generally known coming back live Crickhollow.’ Frodo sat thought. ‘I made mind,’ said finally. ‘I starting tomorrow, soon light. But I going road: would safer wait that. If I go North-gate departure Buckland known once, instead secret several days least, might be. And more, Bridge East Road near borders certainly watched, whether Rider gets Buckland not. We don’t know many are; least two, possibly more. The thing go quite unexpected direction.’ ‘But mean going Old Forest!’ said Fredegar horrified. ‘You can’t thinking that. It quite dangerous Black Riders.’ ‘Not quite,’ said Merry. ‘It sounds desperate, I believe Frodo right. It way getting without followed once. With luck might get considerable start.’ ‘But won’t luck Old Forest,’ objected Fredegar. ‘No one ever luck there. You’ll get lost. People don’t go there.’ ‘Oh yes do!’ said Merry. ‘The Brandybucks go – occasionally fit takes them. We private entrance. Frodo went once, long ago. I several times: usually daylight, course, trees sleepy fairly quiet.’ ‘Well, think best!’ said Fredegar. ‘I afraid Old Forest anything I know about: stories nightmare; vote hardly counts, I going journey. Still, I glad someone stopping behind, tell Gandalf done, turns up, I sure long.’ Fond Frodo, Fatty Bolger desire leave Shire, see lay outside it. His family came Eastfarthing, Budgeford Bridgefields fact, never Brandywine Bridge. His task, according original plans conspirators, stay behind deal inquisitive folk, keep long possible pretence Mr. Baggins still living Crickhollow. He even brought along old clothes Frodo’s help playing part. They little thought dangerous part might prove. ‘Excellent!’ said Frodo, understood plan. ‘We could left message behind Gandalf otherwise. I don’t know whether Riders read not, course, I dared risk written message, case got searched house. But Fatty willing hold fort, I sure Gandalf knowing way gone, decides me. I going Old Forest first thing tomorrow.’ ‘Well, that’s that,’ said Pippin. ‘On whole I would rather job Fatty’s – waiting till Black Riders come.’ ‘You wait till well inside Forest,’ said Fredegar. ‘You’ll wish back time tomorrow.’ ‘It’s good arguing more,’ said Merry. ‘We still got tidy put finishing touches packing, get bed. I shall call break day.’ When last got bed, Frodo could sleep time. His legs ached. He glad riding morning. Eventually fell vague dream, seemed looking high window dark sea tangled trees. Down among roots sound creatures crawling snuffling. He felt sure would smell sooner later. Then heard noise distance. At first thought great wind coming leaves forest. Then knew leaves, sound Sea far-off; sound never heard waking life, though often troubled dreams. Suddenly found open. There trees all. He dark heath, strange salt smell air. Looking saw tall white tower, standing alone high ridge. A great desire came climb tower see Sea. He started struggle ridge towards tower: suddenly light came sky, noise thunder. Chapter 6 THE OLD FOREST Frodo woke suddenly. It still dark room. Merry standing candle one hand, banging door other. ‘All right! What it?’ said Frodo, still shaken bewildered. ‘What it!’ cried Merry. ‘It time get up. It half past fourandveryfoggy.Comeon!Samisalreadygettingbreakfast ready. Even Pippin up. I going saddle ponies, fetch one baggage-carrier. Wake sluggard Fatty! At least must get see us off.’ Soon six o’clock five hobbits ready start. Fatty Bolger still yawning. They stole quietly house. Merry went front leading laden pony, took way along path went spinney behind house, cut across several fields. The leaves trees glistening, every twig dripping; grass grey cold dew. Everything still, far-away noises seemed near clear: fowls chattering yard, someone closing door distant house. In shed found ponies: sturdy little beasts kind loved hobbits, speedy, good long day’s work. They mounted, soon riding mist, seemed open reluctantly close forbiddingly behind them. After riding hour, slowly without talking, saw Hedge looming suddenly ahead. It tall netted silver cobwebs. ‘How going get this?’ asked Fredegar. ‘Follow me!’ said Merry, ‘and see.’ He turned left along Hedge, soon came point bent inwards, running along lip hollow. A cutting made, distance Hedge, went sloping gently ground. It walls brick sides, rose steadily, suddenly arched formed tunnel dived deep Hedge came hollow side. Here Fatty Bolger halted. ‘Good-bye, Frodo!’ said. ‘I wish going Forest. I hope need rescuing day out. But good luck – today every day!’ ‘If worse things ahead Old Forest, I shall lucky,’ said Frodo. ‘Tell Gandalf hurry along East Road: shall soon back going fast can.’ ‘Good-bye!’ cried, rode slope disappeared Fredegar’s sight tunnel. It dark damp. At far end closed gate thick-set iron bars. Merry got unlocked gate, passed pushed again. It shut clang, lock clicked. The sound ominous. ‘There!’ said Merry. ‘You left Shire, outside, edge Old Forest.’ ‘Are stories true?’ asked Pippin. ‘I don’t know stories mean,’ Merry answered. ‘If mean old bogey-stories Fatty’s nurses used tell him, goblins wolves things sort, I say no. At rate I don’t believe them. But Forest queer. Everything much alive, aware going on, speak, things Shire. And trees like strangers. They watch you. They usually content merely watch you, long daylight lasts, don’t much. Occasionally unfriendly ones may drop branch, stick root out, grasp long trailer. But night things alarming, I told. I twice dark, near hedge. I thought trees whispering other, passing news plots along unintelligible language; branches swayed groped without wind. They say trees actually move, surround strangers hem in. In fact long ago attacked Hedge: came planted right it, leaned it. But hobbits came cut hundreds trees, made great bonfire Forest, burned ground long strip east Hedge. After trees gave attack, became unfriendly. There still wide bare space far inside bonfire made.’ ‘Is trees dangerous?’ asked Pippin. ‘There various queer things living deep Forest, far side,’ said Merry, ‘or least I heard so; I never seen them. But something makes paths. Whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks; seem shift change time time queer fashion. Not far tunnel is, long time, beginning quite broad path leading Bonfire Glade, less direction, east little north. That path I going try find.’ The hobbits left tunnel-gate rode across wide hollow. On far side faint path leading floor Forest, hundred yards beyond Hedge; vanished soon brought trees. Looking back could see dark line Hedge stems trees already thick them. Looking ahead could see tree-trunks innumerable sizes shapes: straight bent, twisted, leaning, squat slender, smooth gnarled branched; stems green grey moss slimy, shaggy growths. Merry alone seemed fairly cheerful. ‘You better lead find path,’ Frodo said him. ‘Don’t let us lose one another, forget way Hedge lies!’ They picked way among trees, ponies plodded along, carefully avoiding many writhing interlacing roots. There undergrowth. The ground rising steadily, went forward seemed trees became taller, darker, thicker. There sound, except occasional drip moisture falling still leaves. For moment whispering movement among branches; got uncomfortable feeling watched disapproval, deepening dislike even enmity. The feeling steadily grew, found looking quickly, glancing back shoulders, expected sudden blow. There yet sign path, trees seemed constantly bar way. Pippin suddenly felt could bear longer, without warning let shout. ‘Oi! Oi!’ cried. ‘I going anything. Just let pass through, you!’ The others halted startled; cry fell muffled heavy curtain. There echo answer though wood seemed become crowded watchful before. ‘I shout, I you,’ said Merry. ‘It harm good.’ Frodo began wonder possible find way through, right make others come abominable wood. Merry looking side side, seemed already uncertain way go. Pippin noticed it. ‘It taken long lose us,’ said. But moment Merry gave whistle relief pointed ahead. ‘Well, well!’ said. ‘These trees shift. There Bonfire Glade front us (or I hope so), path seems moved away!’ The light grew clearer went forward. Suddenly came trees found wide circular space. There sky them, blue clear surprise, Forest-roof able see rising morning lifting mist. The sun not, however, high enough yet shine clearing, though light tree-tops. The leaves thicker greener edges glade, enclosing almost solid wall. No tree grew there, rough grass many tall plants: stalky faded hemlocks wood-parsley, fire-weed seeding fluffy ashes, rampant nettles thistles. A dreary place: seemed charming cheerful garden close Forest. The hobbits felt encouraged, looked hopefully broadening daylight sky. At far side glade break wall trees, clear path beyond it. They could see running wood, wide places open above, though every trees drew overshadowed dark boughs. Up path rode. They still climbing gently, went much quicker, better heart; seemed Forest relented, going let pass unhindered all. But air began get hot stuffy. The trees drew close either side, could longer see far ahead. Now stronger ever felt ill wood pressing them. So silent fall ponies’ hoofs, rustling dead leaves occasionally stumbling hidden roots, seemed thud ears. Frodo tried sing song encourage them, voice sank murmur. O! Wanderers shadowed land despair not! For though dark stand, woods must end last, see open sun go past: setting sun, rising sun, day’s end, day begun. For east west woods must fail . . . Fail – even said word voice faded silence. The air seemed heavy making words wearisome. Just behind large branch fell old overhanging tree crash path. The trees seemed close them. ‘They like ending failing,’ said Merry. ‘I sing present. Wait till get edge, we’ll turn give rousing chorus!’ He spoke cheerfully, felt great anxiety, show it. The others answer. They depressed. A heavy weight settling steadily Frodo’s heart, regretted every step forward ever thought challenging menace trees. He was, indeed, stop propose going back (if still possible), things took new turn. The path stopped climbing, became nearly level. The dark trees drew aside, ahead could see path going almost straight forward. Before them, distance off, stood green hill-top, treeless, rising like bald head encircling wood. The path seemed making directly it. They hurried forward again, delighted thought climbing roof Forest. The path dipped, began climb upwards, leading last foot steep hillside. There left trees faded turf. The wood stood round hill like thick hair ended sharply circle round shaven crown. The hobbits led ponies up, winding round round reached top. There stood gazed them. The air gleaming sunlit, hazy; could see great distance. Near hand mist almost gone; though lay hollows wood, south them, deep fold cutting right across Forest, fog still rose like steam wisps white smoke. ‘That,’ said Merry, pointing hand, ‘that line Withywindle. It comes Downs flows south-west midst Forest join Brandywine Haysend. We don’t want go way! The Withywindle valley said queerest part whole wood – centre queerness comes, were.’ The others looked direction Merry pointed out, could see little mists damp deep-cut valley; beyond southern half Forest faded view. The sun hill-top getting hot. It must eleven o’clock; autumn haze still prevented seeing much directions. In west could make either line Hedge valley Brandywine beyond it. Northward, looked hopefully, could see nothing might line great East Road, making. They island sea trees, horizon veiled. On south-eastern side ground fell steeply, slopes hill continued far trees, like island-shores really sides mountain rising deep waters. They sat green edge looked woods them, ate mid-day meal. As sun rose passed noon glimpsed far east grey-green lines Downs lay beyond Old Forest side. That cheered greatly; good see sight anything beyond wood’s borders, though mean go way, could help it: Barrow-downs sinister reputation hobbit-legend Forest itself. Atlengththeymadeuptheir mindstogoonagain.Thepath brought hill reappeared northward side; followed far became aware bending steadily right. Soon began descend rapidly guessed must actually heading towards Withywindle valley: direction wished take. After discussion decided leave misleading path strike northward; although able see hill-top, Road must lie way, could many miles off. Also northward, left path, land seemed drier open, climbing slopes trees thinner, pines firs replaced oaks ashes strange nameless trees denser wood. At first choice seemed good: got along fair speed, though whenever got glimpse sun open glade seemed unaccountably veered eastwards. But time trees began close again, appeared distance thinner less tangled. Then deep folds ground discovered unexpectedly, like ruts great giant-wheels wide moats sunken roads long disused choked brambles. These lay usually right across line march, could crossed scrambling again, troublesome difficult ponies. Each time climbed found hollow filled thick bushes matted undergrowth, somehow would yield left, gave way turned right; go distance along bottom could find way bank. Each time clambered out, trees seemed deeper darker; always left upwards difficult find way, forced right downwards. After hour two lost clear sense direction, though knew well enough long ceased go northward all. They headed off, simply following course chosen – eastwards southwards, heart Forest it. The afternoon wearing away scrambled stumbled fold wider deeper yet met. It steep overhung proved impossible climb again, either forwards backwards, without leaving ponies baggage behind. All could follow fold – downwards. The ground grew soft, places boggy; springs appeared banks, soon found following brook trickled babbled weedy bed. Then ground began fall rapidly, brook growing strong noisy, flowed leaped swiftly downhill. They deep dim-lit gully over-arched trees high them. After stumbling along way along stream, came quite suddenly gloom. As gate saw sunlight them. Coming opening found made way cleft high steep bank, almost cliff. At feet wide space grass reeds; distance could glimpsed another bank almost steep. A golden afternoon late sunshine lay warm drowsy upon hidden land between. In midst wound lazily dark river brown water, bordered ancient willows, arched willows, blocked fallen willows, flecked thousands faded willow-leaves. The air thick them, fluttering yellow branches; warm gentle breeze blowing softly valley, reeds rustling, willow-boughs creaking. ‘Well, I least notion are!’ said Merry. ‘We come almost opposite direction intended. This River Withywindle! I go explore.’ He passed sunshine disappeared long grasses. After reappeared, reported fairly solid ground cliff-foot river; places firm turf went water’s edge. ‘What’s more,’ said, ‘there seems something like footpath winding along side river. If turn left follow it, shall bound come east side Forest eventually.’ ‘I dare say!’ said Pippin. ‘That is, track goes far, simply lead us bog leave us there. Who made track, suppose, why? I sure benefit. I getting suspicious Forest everything it, I begin believe stories it. And idea far eastward go?’ ‘No,’ said Merry, ‘I haven’t. I don’t know least far Withywindle are, could possibly come often enough make path along it. But way I see think of.’ There nothing else it, filed out, Merry led path discovered. Everywhere reeds grasses lush tall, places far heads; found, path easy follow, turned twisted, picking sounder ground among bogs pools. Here passed rills, running gullies Withywindle higher forest-lands, points tree-trunks bundles brushwood laid carefully across. The hobbits began feel hot. There armies flies kinds buzzing round ears, afternoon sun burning backs. At last came suddenly thin shade; great grey branches reached across path. Each step forward became reluctant last. Sleepiness seemed creeping ground legs, falling softly air upon heads eyes. Frodo felt chin go head nod. Just front Pippin fell forward knees. Frodo halted. ‘It’s good,’ heard Merry saying. ‘Can’t go another step without rest. Must nap. It’s cool willows. Less flies!’ Frodo like sound this. ‘Come on!’ cried. ‘We can’t nap yet. We must get clear Forest first.’ But others far gone care. Beside Sam stood yawning blinking stupidly. Suddenly Frodo felt sleep overwhelming him. His head swam. There seemed hardly sound air. The flies stopped buzzing. Only gentle noise edge hearing, soft fluttering song half whispered, seemed stir boughs above. He lifted heavy eyes saw leaning huge willow-tree, old hoary. Enormous looked, sprawling branches going like reaching arms many long-fingered hands, knotted twisted trunk gaping wide fissures creaked faintly boughs moved. The leaves fluttering bright sky dazzled him, toppled over, lying fell upon grass. Merry Pippin dragged forward lay backs willow-trunk. Behind great cracks gaped wide receive tree swayed creaked. They looked grey yellow leaves, moving softly light, singing. They shut eyes, seemed could almost hear words, cool words, saying something water sleep. They gave spell fell fast asleep foot great grey willow. Frodo lay fighting sleep overpowering him; effort struggled feet again. He felt compelling desire cool water. ‘Wait me, Sam,’ stammered. ‘Must bathe feet minute.’ Half dream wandered forward riverward side tree, great winding roots grew stream, like gnarled dragonets straining drink. He straddled one these, paddled hot feet cool brown water; suddenly fell asleep back tree. Sam sat scratched head, yawned like cavern. He worried. The afternoon getting late, thought sudden sleepiness uncanny. ‘There’s behind sun warm air,’ muttered himself. ‘I don’t like great big tree. I don’t trust it. Hark singing sleep now! This won’t all!’ He pulled feet, staggered see become ponies. He found two wandered good way along path; caught brought back towards others, heard two noises; one loud, soft clear. One splash something heavy falling water; noise like snick lock door quietly closes fast. He rushed back bank. Frodo water close edge, great tree-root seemed holding down, struggling. Sam gripped jacket, dragged root; difficulty hauled bank. Almost woke, coughed spluttered. ‘Do know, Sam,’ said length, ‘the beastly tree threw in! I felt it. The big root twisted round tipped in!’ ‘You dreaming I expect, Mr. Frodo,’ said Sam. ‘You shouldn’t sit place, feel sleepy.’ ‘What others?’ Frodo asked. ‘I wonder sort dreams having.’ They went round side tree, Sam understood click heard. Pippin vanished. The crack laid closed together, chink could seen. Merry trapped: another crack closed waist; legs lay outside, rest inside dark opening, edges gripped like pair pincers. Frodo Sam beat first upon tree-trunk Pippin lain. They struggled frantically pull open jaws crack held poor Merry. It quite useless. ‘What foul thing happen!’ cried Frodo wildly. ‘Why ever come dreadful Forest? I wish back Crickhollow!’ He kicked tree strength, heedless feet. A hardly perceptible shiver ran stem branches; leaves rustled whispered, sound faint far-off laughter. ‘I suppose haven’t got axe among luggage, Mr. Frodo?’ asked Sam. ‘I brought little hatchet chopping firewood,’ said Frodo. ‘That wouldn’t much use.’ ‘Wait minute!’ cried Sam, struck idea suggested firewood. ‘We might something fire!’ ‘We might,’ said Frodo doubtfully. ‘We might succeed roasting Pippin alive inside.’ ‘We might try hurt frighten tree begin with,’ said Sam fiercely. ‘If don’t let go, I’ll down, I gnaw it.’ He ran ponies long came back two tinder-boxes hatchet. Quickly gathered dry grass leaves, bits bark; made pile broken twigs chopped sticks. These heaped trunk far side tree prisoners. As soon Sam struck spark tinder, kindled dry grass flurry flame smoke went up. The twigs crackled. Little fingers fire licked dry scored rind ancient tree scorched it. A tremor ran whole willow. The leaves seemed hiss heads sound pain anger. A loud scream came Merry, far inside tree heard Pippin give muffled yell. ‘Put out! Put out!’ cried Merry. ‘He’ll squeeze two, don’t. He says so!’ ‘Who? What?’ shouted Frodo, rushing round side tree. ‘Put out! Put out!’ begged Merry. The branches willow began sway violently. There sound wind rising spreading outwards branches trees round about, though dropped stone quiet slumber river-valley set ripples anger ran whole Forest. Sam kicked little fire stamped sparks. But Frodo, without clear idea so, hoped for, ran along path crying help! help! help! It seemed could hardly hear sound shrill voice: blown away willow-wind drowned clamour leaves, soon words left mouth. He felt desperate: lost witless. Suddenly stopped. There answer, thought; seemed come behind him, away path back Forest. He turned round listened, soon could doubt: someone singing song; deep glad voice singing carelessly happily, singing nonsense: Hey dol! merry dol! ring dong dillo! Ring dong! hop along! fal lal willow! Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo! Half hopeful half afraid new danger, Frodo Sam stood still. Suddenly long string nonsense-words (or seemed) voice rose loud clear burst song: Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My darling! Light goes weather-wind feathered starling. Down along Hill, shining sunlight, Waiting doorstep cold starlight, There pretty lady is, River-woman’s daughter, Slender willow-wand, clearer water. Old Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing Comes hopping home again. Can hear singing? Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! merry-o, Goldberry, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o! Poor old Willow-man, tuck roots away! Tom’s hurry now. Evening follow day. Tom’s going home water-lilies bringing. Hey! Come derry dol! Can hear singing? Frodo Sam stood enchanted. The wind puffed out. The leaves hung silently stiff branches. There another burst song, suddenly, hopping dancing along path, appeared reeds old battered hat tall crown long blue feather stuck band. With another hop bound came view man, seemed. At rate large heavy hobbit, quite tall enough one Big People, though made noise enough one, stumping along great yellow boots thick legs, charging grass rushes like cow going drink. He blue coat long brown beard; eyes blue bright, face red ripe apple, creased hundred wrinkles laughter. In hands carried large leaf tray small pile white water-lilies. ‘Help!’ cried Frodo Sam running towards hands stretched out. ‘Whoa! Whoa! steady there!’ cried old man, holding one hand, stopped short, struck stiff. ‘Now, little fellows, a-going to, puffing like bellows? What’s matter then? Do know I am? I’m Tom Bombadil. Tell what’s trouble! Tom’s hurry now. Don’t crush lilies!’ ‘My friends caught willow-tree,’ cried Frodo breathlessly. ‘Master Merry’s squeezed crack!’ cried Sam. ‘What?’ shouted Tom Bombadil, leaping air. ‘Old Man Willow? Naught worse that, eh? That soon mended. I know tune him. Old grey Willow-man! I’ll freeze marrow cold, don’t behave himself. I’ll sing roots off. I’ll sing wind blow leaf branch away. Old Man Willow!’ Setting lilies carefully grass, ran tree. There saw Merry’s feet still sticking – rest already drawn inside. Tom put mouth crack began singing low voice. They could catch words, evidently Merry aroused. His legs began kick. Tom sprang away, breaking hanging branch smote side willow it. ‘You let again, Old Man Willow!’ said. ‘What a-thinking of? You waking. Eat earth! Dig deep! Drink water! Go sleep! Bombadil talking!’ He seized Merry’s feet drew suddenly widening crack. There tearing creak crack split open, Pippin sprang, kicked. Then loud snap cracks closed fast again. A shudder ran tree root tip, complete silence fell. ‘Thank you!’ said hobbits, one other. Tom Bombadil burst laughing. ‘Well, little fellows!’ said he, stooping peered faces. ‘You shall come home me! The table laden yellow cream, honeycomb, white bread butter. Goldberry waiting. Time enough questions around supper table. You follow quick able!’ With picked lilies, beckoning wave hand went hopping dancing along path eastward, still singing loudly nonsensically. Too surprised relieved talk, hobbits followed fast could. But fast enough. Tom soon disappeared front them, noise singing got fainter away. Suddenly voice came floating back loud halloo! Hop along, little friends, Withywindle! Tom’s going ahead candles kindle. Down west sinks Sun: soon groping. When night-shadows fall, door open, Out window-panes light twinkle yellow. Fear alder black! Heed hoary willow! Fear neither root bough! Tom goes you. Hey now! merry dol! We’ll waiting you! After hobbits heard more. Almost sun seemed sink trees behind them. They thought slanting light evening glittering Brandywine River, windows Bucklebury beginning gleam hundreds lights. Great shadows fell across them; trunks branches trees hung dark threatening path. White mists began rise curl surface river stray roots trees upon borders. Out ground feet shadowy steam arose mingled swiftly falling dusk. It became difficult follow path, tired. Their legs seemed leaden. Strange furtive noises ran among bushes reeds either side them; looked pale sky, caught sight queer gnarled knobbly faces gloomed dark twilight, leered high bank edges wood. They began feel country unreal, stumbling ominous dream led awakening. Just felt feet slowing standstill, noticed ground gently rising. The water began murmur. In darkness caught white glimmer foam, river flowed short fall. Then suddenly trees came end mists left behind. They stepped Forest, found wide sweep grass welling them. The river, small swift, leaping merrily meet them, glinting light stars, already shining sky. The grass feet smooth short, mown shaven. The eaves Forest behind clipped, trim hedge. The path plain them, well-tended bordered stone. It wound top grassy knoll, grey pale starry night; there, still high slope, saw twinkling lights house. Down path went, again, long smooth hillside turf, towards light. Suddenly wide yellow beam flowed brightly door opened. There Tom Bombadil’s house them, up, down, hill. Behind steep shoulder land lay grey bare, beyond dark shapes Barrow-downs stalked away eastern night. They hurried forward, hobbits ponies. Already half weariness fears fallen them. Hey! Come merry dol! rolled song greet them. Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, hearties! Hobbits! Ponies all! We fond parties. Now let fun begin! Let us sing together! Then another clear voice, young ancient Spring, like song glad water flowing night bright morning hills, came falling like silver meet them: Now let song begin! Let us sing together Of sun, stars, moon mist, rain cloudy weather, Light budding leaf, dew feather, Wind open hill, bells heather, Reeds shady pool, lilies water: Old Tom Bombadil River-daughter! And song hobbits stood upon threshold, golden light them. Chapter 7 IN THE HOUSE OF TOM BOMBADIL The four hobbits stepped wide stone threshold, stood still, blinking. They long low room, filled light lamps swinging beams roof; table dark polished wood stood many candles, tall yellow, burning brightly. In chair, far side room facing outer door, sat woman. Her long yellow hair rippled shoulders; gown green, green young reeds, shot silver like beads dew; belt gold, shaped like chain flag-lilies set pale-blue eyes forgetme-nots. About feet wide vessels green brown earthenware, white water-lilies floating, seemed enthroned midst pool. ‘Enter, good guests!’ said, spoke knew clear voice heard singing. They came timid steps room, began bow low, feeling strangely surprised awkward, like folk that, knocking cottage door beg drink water, answered fair young elf-queen clad living flowers. But could say anything, sprang lightly lily-bowls, ran laughing towards them; ran gown rustled softly like wind flowering borders river. ‘Comedearfolk!’shesaid,takingFrodobythehand.‘Laugh merry! I Goldberry, daughter River.’ Then lightly passed closing door turned back it, white arms spread across it. ‘Let us shut outthenight!’shesaid.‘Foryouarestillafraid,perhaps,ofmist tree-shadows deep water, untame things. Fear nothing!FortonightyouareundertheroofofTomBombadil.’ The hobbits looked wonder; looked smiled. ‘Fair lady Goldberry!’ said Frodo last, feeling heart moved joy understand. He stood times stood enchanted fair elven-voices; spell laid upon different: less keen lofty delight, deeper nearer mortal heart; marvellous yet strange. ‘Fair lady Goldberry!’ said again. ‘Now joy hidden songs heard made plain me. O slender willow-wand! O clearer clear water! O reed living pool! Fair River-daughter! O spring-time summer-time, spring after! O wind waterfall, leaves’ laughter!’ Suddenly stopped stammered, overcome surprise hear saying things. But Goldberry laughed. ‘Welcome!’ said. ‘I heard folk Shire sweet-tongued. But I see Elf-friend; light eyes ring voice tells it. This merry meeting! Sit now, wait Master house! He long. He tending tired beasts.’ The hobbits sat gladly low rush-seated chairs, Goldberry busied table; eyes followed her, slender grace movement filled quiet delight. From somewhere behind house came sound singing. Every caught, among many derry dol merry dol ring ding dillo repeated words: Old Tom Bombadil merry fellow; Bright blue jacket is, boots yellow. ‘Fair lady!’ said Frodo while. ‘Tell me, asking seem foolish, Tom Bombadil?’ ‘He is,’ said Goldberry, staying swift movements smiling. Frodo looked questioningly. ‘He is, seen him,’ said answer look. ‘He Master wood, water, hill.’ ‘Then strange land belongs him?’ ‘No indeed!’ answered, smile faded. ‘That would indeed burden,’ added low voice, herself. ‘The trees grasses things growing living land belong themselves. Tom Bombadil Master. No one ever caught old Tom walking forest, wading water, leaping hill-tops light shadow. He fear. Tom Bombadil master.’ A door opened came Tom Bombadil. He hat thick brown hair crowned autumn leaves. He laughed, going Goldberry, took hand. ‘Here’s pretty lady!’ said, bowing hobbits. ‘Here’s Goldberry clothed silver-green flowers girdle! Is table laden? I see yellow cream honeycomb, white bread, butter; milk, cheese, green herbs ripe berries gathered. Is enough us? Is supper ready?’ ‘It is,’ said Goldberry; ‘but guests perhaps not?’ Tom clapped hands cried: ‘Tom, Tom! guests tired, near forgotten! Come now, merry friends, Tom refresh you! You shall clean grimy hands, wash weary faces; cast muddy cloaks comb tangles!’ He opened door, followed short passage round sharp turn. They came low room sloping roof (a penthouse, seemed, built north end house). Its walls clean stone, mostly covered green hanging mats yellow curtains. The floor flagged, strewn fresh green rushes. There four deep mattresses, piled white blankets, laid floor along one side. Against opposite wall long bench laden wide earthenware basins, beside stood brown ewers filled water, cold, steaming hot. There soft green slippers set ready beside bed. Before long, washed refreshed, hobbits seated table, two side, either end sat Goldberry Master. It long merry meal. Though hobbits ate, famished hobbits eat, lack. The drink drinking-bowls seemed clear cold water, yet went hearts like wine set free voices. The guests became suddenly aware singing merrily, easier natural talking. At last Tom Goldberry rose cleared table swiftly. The guests commanded sit quiet, set chairs, footstool tired feet. There fire wide hearth them, burning sweet smell, built apple-wood. When everything set order, lights room put out, except one lamp pair candles end chimney-shelf. Then Goldberry came stood them, holding candle; wished good night deep sleep. ‘Have peace now,’ said, ‘until morning! Heed nightly noises! For nothing passes door window save moonlight starlight wind hill-top. Good night!’ She passed room glimmer rustle. The sound footsteps like stream falling gently away downhill cool stones quiet night. Tom sat beside silence, tried muster courage ask one many questions meant ask supper. Sleep gathered eyelids. At last Frodo spoke: ‘Did hear calling, Master, chance brought moment?’ Tom stirred like man shaken pleasant dream. ‘Eh, what?’ said he. ‘Did I hear calling? Nay, I hear: I busy singing. Just chance brought then, chance call it. It plan mine, though I waiting you. We heard news you, learned wandering. We guessed you’d come ere long water: paths lead way, Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he’s mighty singer; it’s hard little folk escape cunning mazes. But Tom errand there, dared hinder.’ Tom nodded sleep taking again; went soft singing voice: I errand there: gathering water-lilies, green leaves lilies white please pretty lady, last ere year’s end keep winter, flower pretty feet till snows melted. Each year summer’s end I go find her, wide pool, deep clear, far Withywindle; open first spring linger latest. By pool long ago I found River-daughter, fair young Goldberry sitting rushes. Sweet singing then, heart beating! He opened eyes looked sudden glint blue: And proved well – I shall longer go deep along forest-water, year old. Nor shall I passing Old Man Willow’s house side spring-time, till merry spring, River-daughter dances withy-path bathe water. He fell silent again; Frodo could help asking one question: one desired answered. ‘Tell us, Master,’ said, ‘about Willow-man. What he? I never heard before.’ ‘No, don’t!’ said Merry Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright. ‘Not now! Not morning!’ ‘That right!’ said old man. ‘Now time resting. Some things ill hear world’s shadow. Sleep till morning-light, rest pillow! Heed nightly noise! Fear grey willow!’ And took lamp blew out, grasping candle either hand led room. Their mattresses pillows soft down, blankets white wool. They hardly laid deep beds drawn light covers asleep. In dead night, Frodo lay dream without light. Then saw young moon rising; thin light loomed black wall rock, pierced dark arch like great gate. It seemed Frodo lifted up, passing saw rock-wall circle hills, within plain, midst plain stood pinnacle stone, like vast tower made hands. On top stood figure man. The moon rose seemed hang moment head glistened white hair wind stirred it. Up dark plain came crying fell voices, howling many wolves. Suddenly shadow, like shape great wings, passed across moon. The figure lifted arms light flashed staff wielded. A mighty eagle swept bore away. The voices wailed wolves yammered. There noise like strong wind blowing, borne sound hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping East. ‘Black Riders!’ thought Frodo wakened, sound hoofs still echoing mind. He wondered would ever courage leave safety stone walls. He lay motionless, still listening; silent, last turned fell asleep wandered unremembered dream. At side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; change came dreams turned groaned. Suddenly woke, thought waked, yet still heard darkness sound disturbed dream: tip-tap, squeak: noise like branches fretting wind, twig-fingers scraping wall window: creak, creak, creak. He wondered willow-trees close house; suddenly dreadful feeling ordinary house all, inside willow listening horrible dry creaking voice laughing again. He sat up, felt soft pillows yield hands, lay relieved. He seemed hear echo words ears: ‘Fear nothing! Have peace morning! Heed nightly noises!’ Then went sleep again. It sound water Merry heard falling quiet sleep: water streaming gently, spreading, spreading irresistibly round house dark shoreless pool. It gurgled walls, rising slowly surely. ‘I shall drowned!’ thought. ‘It find way in, I shall drown.’ He felt lying soft slimy bog, springing set foot corner cold hard flagstone. Then remembered lay again. He seemed hear remember hearing: ‘Nothing passes doors windows save moonlight starlight wind hill-top.’ A little breath sweet air moved curtain. He breathed deep fell asleep again. As far could remember, Sam slept night deep content, logs contented. They woke up, four once, morning light. Tom moving room whistling like starling. When heard stir clapped hands, cried: ‘Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My hearties!’ He drew back yellow curtains, hobbits saw covered windows, either end room, one looking east looking west. They leapt refreshed. Frodo ran eastern window, found looking kitchen-garden grey dew. He half expected see turf right walls, turf pocked hoof-prints. Actually view screened tall line beans poles; far beyond grey top hill loomed sunrise. It pale morning: East, behind long clouds like lines soiled wool stained red edges, lay glimmering deeps yellow. The sky spoke rain come; light broadening quickly, red flowers beans began glow wet green leaves. Pippin looked western window, pool mist. The Forest hidden fog. It like looking sloping cloud-roof above. There fold channel mist broken many plumes billows: valley Withywindle. The stream ran hill left vanished white shadows. Near hand flower-garden clipped hedge silver-netted, beyond grey shaven grass pale dew-drops. There willow-tree seen. ‘Good morning, merry friends!’ cried Tom, opening eastern window wide. A cool air flowed in; rainy smell. ‘Sun won’t show face much today, I’m thinking. I walking wide, leaping hill-tops, since grey dawn began, nosing wind weather, wet grass underfoot, wet sky me. I wakened Goldberry singing window; naught wakes hobbit-folk early morning. In night little folk wake darkness, sleep light come! Ring ding dillo! Wake now, merry friends! Forget nightly noises! Ring ding dillo del! derry del, hearties! If come soon you’ll find breakfast table. If come late you’ll get grass rain-water!’ Needless say – Tom’s threat sounded serious – hobbits came soon, left table late beginning look rather empty. Neither Tom Goldberry there. Tom could heard house, clattering kitchen, stairs, singing outside. The room looked westward mist-clouded valley, window open. Water dripped thatched eaves above. Before finished breakfast clouds joined unbroken roof, straight grey rain came softly steadily down. Behind deep curtain Forest completely veiled. As looked window came falling gently flowing rain sky, clear voice Goldberry singing them. They could hear words, seemed plain song rain-song, sweet showers dry hills, told tale river spring highlands Sea far below. The hobbits listened delight; Frodo glad heart, blessed kindly weather, delayed departing. The thought going heavy upon moment awoke; guessed would go day. The upper wind settled West deeper wetter clouds rolled spill laden rain bare heads Downs. Nothing could seen round house falling water. Frodo stood near open door watched white chalky path turn little river milk go bubbling away valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round corner house, waving arms warding rain – indeed sprang threshold seemed quite dry, except boots. These took put chimney-corner. Then sat largest chair called hobbits gather round him. ‘This Goldberry’s washing day,’ said, ‘and autumn-cleaning. Too wet hobbit-folk – let rest able! It’s good day long tales, questions answers, Tom start talking.’ He told many remarkable stories, sometimes half speaking himself, sometimes looking suddenly bright blue eye deep brows. Often voice would turn song, would get chair dance about. He told tales bees flowers, ways trees, strange creatures Forest, evil things good things, things friendly things unfriendly, cruel things kind things, secrets hidden brambles. As listened, began understand lives Forest, apart themselves, indeed feel strangers things home. Moving constantly talk Old Man Willow, Frodo learned enough content him, indeed enough, comfortable lore. Tom’s words laid bare hearts trees thoughts, often dark strange, filled hatred things go free upon earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers usurpers. It called Old Forest without reason, indeed ancient, survivor vast forgotten woods; lived yet, ageing quicker hills, fathers fathers trees, remembering times lords. The countless years filled pride rooted wisdom, malice. But none dangerous Great Willow: heart rotten, strength green; cunning, master winds, song thought ran woods sides river. His grey thirsty spirit drew power earth spread like fine root-threads ground, invisible twig-fingers air, till dominion nearly trees Forest Hedge Downs. Suddenly Tom’s talk left woods went leaping young stream, bubbling waterfalls, pebbles worn rocks, among small flowers close grass wet crannies, wandering last Downs. They heard Great Barrows, green mounds, stonerings upon hills hollows among hills. Sheep bleating flocks. Green walls white walls rose. There fortresses heights. Kings little kingdoms fought together, young Sun shone like fire red metal new greedy swords. There victory defeat; towers fell, fortresses burned, flames went sky. Gold piled biers dead kings queens; mounds covered them, stone doors shut; grass grew all. Sheep walked biting grass, soon hills empty again. A shadow came dark places far away, bones stirred mounds. Barrow-wights walked hollow places clink rings cold fingers, gold chains wind. Stone rings grinned ground like broken teeth moonlight. The hobbits shuddered. Even Shire rumour Barrow-wights Barrow-downs beyond Forest heard. But tale hobbit liked listen to, even comfortable fireside far away. These four suddenly remembered joy house driven minds: house Tom Bombadil nestled shoulder dreaded hills. They lost thread tale shifted uneasily, looking aside one another. When caught words found wandered strange regions beyond memory beyond waking thought, times world wider, seas flowed straight western Shore; still back Tom went singing ancient starlight, Elf-sires awake. Then suddenly stopped, saw nodded falling asleep. The hobbits sat still him, enchanted; seemed if, spell words, wind gone, clouds dried up, day withdrawn, darkness come East West, sky filled light white stars. Whether morning evening one day many days passed Frodo could tell. He feel either hungry tired, filled wonder. The stars shone window silence heavens seemed round him. He spoke last wonder sudden fear silence: ‘Who you, Master?’ asked. ‘Eh, what?’ said Tom sitting up, eyes glinting gloom. ‘Don’t know name yet? That’s answer. Tell me, you, alone, nameless? But young I old. Eldest, that’s I am. Mark words, friends: Tom river trees; Tom remembers first raindrop first acorn. He made paths Big People, saw little People arriving. He Kings graves Barrow-wights. When Elves passed westward, Tom already, seas bent. He knew dark stars fearless – Dark Lord came Outside.’ A shadow seemed pass window, hobbits glanced hastily panes. When turned again, Goldberry stood door behind, framed light. She held candle, shielding flame draught hand; light flowed it, like sunlight white shell. ‘The rain ended,’ said; ‘and new waters running downhill, stars. Let us laugh glad!’ ‘And let us food drink!’ cried Tom. ‘Long tales thirsty. And long listening’s hungry work, morning, noon, evening!’ With jumped chair, bound took candle chimney-shelf lit flame Goldberry held; danced table. Suddenly hopped door disappeared. Quickly returned, bearing large laden tray. Then Tom Goldberry set table; hobbits sat half wonder half laughter: fair grace Goldberry merry odd caperings Tom. Yet fashion seemed weave single dance, neither hindering other, room, round table; great speed food vessels lights set order. The boards blazed candles, white yellow. Tom bowed guests. ‘Supper ready,’ said Goldberry; hobbits saw clothed silver white girdle, shoes like fishes’ mail. But Tom clean blue, blue rain-washed forget-me-nots, green stockings. It supper even better before. The hobbits spell Tom’s words may missed one meal many, food seemed least week since eaten. They sing even speak much while, paid close attention business. But time hearts spirits rose high again, voices rang mirth laughter. After eaten, Goldberry sang many songs them, songs began merrily hills fell softly silence; silences saw minds pools waters wider known, looking saw sky stars like jewels depths. Then wished good night left fireside. But Tom seemed wide awake plied questions. He appeared already know much families, indeed know much history doings Shire days hardly remembered among hobbits themselves. It longer surprised them; made secret owed recent knowledge largely Farmer Maggot, seemed regard person importance imagined. ‘There’s earth old feet, clay fingers; wisdom bones, eyes open,’ said Tom. It also clear Tom dealings Elves, seemed fashion, news reached Gildor concerning flight Frodo. Indeed much Tom know, cunning questioning, Frodo found telling Bilbo hopes fears told even Gandalf. Tom wagged head down, glint eyes heard Riders. ‘Show precious Ring!’ said suddenly midst story: Frodo, astonishment, drew chain pocket, unfastening Ring handed Tom. It seemed grow larger lay moment big brown-skinned hand. Then suddenly put eye laughed. For second hobbits vision, comical alarming, bright blue eye gleaming circle gold. Then Tom put Ring round end little finger held candlelight. For moment hobbits noticed nothing strange this. Then gasped. There sign Tom disappearing! Tom laughed again, spun Ring air – vanished flash. Frodo gave cry – Tom leaned forward handed back smile. Frodo looked closely, rather suspiciously (like one lent trinket juggler). It Ring, looked weighed same: Ring always seemed Frodo weigh strangely heavy hand. But something prompted make sure. He perhaps trifle annoyed Tom seeming make light even Gandalf thought perilously important. He waited opportunity, talk going again, Tom telling absurd story badgers queer ways – slipped Ring on. Merry turned towards say something gave start, checked exclamation. Frodo delighted (in way): ring right, Merry staring blankly chair, obviously could see him. He got crept quietly away fireside towards outer door. ‘Hey there!’ cried Tom, glancing towards seeing look shining eyes. ‘Hey! Come Frodo, there! Where a-going? Old Tom Bombadil’s blind yet. Take golden ring! Your hand’s fair without it. Come back! Leave game sit beside me! We must talk more, think morning. Tom must teach right road, keep feet wandering.’ Frodo laughed (trying feel pleased), taking Ring came sat again. Tom told reckoned Sun would shine tomorrow, would glad morning, setting would hopeful. But would well start early; weather country thing even Tom could sure long, would change sometimes quicker could change jacket. ‘I weather-master,’ said he; ‘nor aught goes two legs.’ By advice decided make nearly due North house, western lower slopes Downs: might hope way strike East Road day’s journey, avoid Barrows. He told afraid – mind business. ‘Keep green grass. Don’t go a-meddling old stone cold Wights prying houses, unless strong folk hearts never falter!’ He said once; advised pass barrows west-side, chanced stray near one. Then taught rhyme sing, ill-luck fall danger difficulty next day. Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! By water, wood hill, reed willow, By fire, sun moon, harken hear us! Come, Tom Bombadil, need near us! When sung altogether him, clapped shoulder laugh, taking candles led back bedroom. Chapter 8 FOG ON THE BARROW-DOWNS That night heard noises. But either dreams them, could tell which, Frodo heard sweet singing running mind: song seemed come like pale light behind grey rain-curtain, growing stronger turn veil glass silver, last rolled back, far green country opened swift sunrise. The vision melted waking; Tom whistling like tree-full birds; sun already slanting hill open window. Outside everything green pale gold. After breakfast, ate alone, made ready say farewell, nearly heavy heart possible morning: cool, bright, clean washed autumn sky thin blue. The air came fresh Northwest. Their quiet ponies almost frisky, sniffing moving restlessly. Tom came house waved hat danced upon doorstep, bidding hobbits get go good speed. They rode along path wound away behind house, went slanting towards north end hill-brow sheltered. They dismounted lead ponies last steep slope, suddenly Frodo stopped. ‘Goldberry!’ cried. ‘My fair lady, clad silver green! We never said farewell her, seen since evening!’ He distressed turned back; moment clear call came rippling down. There hill-brow stood beckoning them: hair flying loose, caught sun shone shimmered. A light like glint water dewy grass flashed feet danced. They hastened last slope, stood breathless beside her. They bowed, wave arm bade look round; looked hill-top lands morning. It clear far-seen veiled misty stood upon knoll Forest, could seen rising pale green dark trees West. In direction land rose wooded ridges, green, yellow, russet sun, beyond lay hidden valley Brandywine. To South, line Withywindle, distant glint like pale glass Brandywine River made great loop lowlands flowed away knowledge hobbits. Northward beyond dwindling downs land ran away flats swellings grey green pale earth-colours, faded featureless shadowy distance. Eastward Barrow-downs rose, ridge behind ridge morning, vanished eyesight guess: guess blue remote white glimmer blending hem sky, spoke them, memory old tales, high distant mountains. They took deep draught air, felt skip stout strides would bear wherever wished. It seemed fainthearted go jogging aside crumpled skirts downs towards Road, leaping, lusty Tom, stepping stones hills straight towards Mountains. Goldberry spoke recalled eyes thoughts. ‘Speed now, fair guests!’ said. ‘And hold purpose! North wind left eye blessing footsteps! Make haste Sun shines!’ And Frodo said: ‘Farewell, Elf-friend, merry meeting!’ But Frodo found words answer. He bowed low, mounted pony, followed friends jogged slowly gentle slope behind hill. Tom Bombadil’s house valley, Forest lost view. The air grew warmer green walls hillside hillside, scent turf rose strong sweet breathed. Turning back, reached bottom green hollow, saw Goldberry, small slender like sunlit flower sky: standing still watching them, hands stretched towards them. As looked gave clear call, lifting hand turned vanished behind hill. Their way wound along floor hollow, round green feet steep hill another deeper broader valley, shoulders hills, long limbs, smooth sides again, new hill-tops new valleys. There tree visible water: country grass short springy turf, silent except whisper air edges land, high lonely cries strange birds. As journeyed sun mounted, grew hot. Each time climbed ridge breeze seemed grown less. When caught glimpse country westward distant Forest seemed smoking, fallen rain steaming leaf root mould. A shadow lay round edge sight, dark haze upper sky like blue cap, hot heavy. About mid-day came hill whose top wide flattened, like shallow saucer green mounded rim. Inside air stirring, sky seemed near heads. They rode across looked northwards. Then hearts rose; seemed plain come already expected. Certainly distances become hazy deceptive, could doubt Downs coming end. A long valley lay winding away northwards, came opening two steep shoulders. Beyond, seemed hills. Due north faintly glimpsed long dark line. ‘That line trees,’ said Merry, ‘and must mark Road. All along many leagues east Bridge trees growing. Some say planted old days.’ ‘Splendid!’ said Frodo. ‘If make good going afternoon done morning, shall left Downs Sun sets jogging search camping place.’ But even spoke turned glance eastwards, saw side hills higher looked upon them; hills crowned green mounds, standing stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth green gums. That view somehow disquieting; turned sight went hollow circle. In midst stood single stone, standing tall sun above, hour casting shadow. It shapeless yet significant: like landmark, guarding finger, like warning. But hungry, sun still fearless noon; set backs east side stone. It cool, sun power warm it; time seemed pleasant. There took food drink, made good noonmeal open sky anyone could wish; food came ‘down Hill’. Tom provided plenty comfort day. Their ponies unburdened strayed upon grass. Riding hills, eating fill, warm sun scent turf, lying little long, stretching legs looking sky noses: things are, perhaps, enough explain happened. However may be: woke suddenly uncomfortably sleep never meant take. The standing stone cold, cast long pale shadow stretched eastward them. The sun, pale watery yellow, gleaming mist west wall hollow lay; north, south, east, beyond wall fog thick, cold white. The air silent, heavy chill. Their ponies standing crowded together heads down. The hobbits sprang feet alarm, ran western rim. They found upon island fog. Even looked dismay towards setting sun, sank eyes white sea, cold grey shadow sprang East behind. The fog rolled walls rose them, mounted bent heads became roof: shut hall mist whose central pillar standing stone. They felt trap closing them; quite lose heart. They still remembered hopeful view line Road ahead, still knew direction lay. In case, great dislike hollow place stone thought remaining minds. They packed quickly chilled fingers would work. Soon leading ponies single file rim long northward slope hill, foggy sea. As went mist became colder damper, hair hung lank dripping foreheads. When reached bottom chill halted got cloaks hoods, soon became bedewed grey drops. Then, mounting ponies, went slowly again, feeling way rise fall ground. They steering, well could guess, gate-like opening far northward end long valley seen morning. Once gap, keep anything like straight line bound end strike Road. Their thoughts go beyond that, except vague hope perhaps away beyond Downs might fog. Their going slow. To prevent getting separated wandering different directions went file, Frodo leading. Sam behind him, came Pippin, Merry. The valley seemed stretch endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw hopeful sign. On either side ahead darkness began loom mist; guessed last approaching gap hills, north-gate Barrow-downs. If could pass that, would free. ‘Come on! Follow me!’ called back shoulder, hurried forward. But hope soon changed bewilderment alarm. The dark patches grew darker, shrank; suddenly saw, towering ominous leaning slightly towards one another like pillars headless door, two huge standing stones. He could remember seen sign valley, looked hill morning. He passed almost aware: even darkness seemed fall round him. His pony reared snorted, fell off. When looked back found alone: others followed him. ‘Sam!’ called. ‘Pippin! Merry! Come along! Why don’t keep up?’ There answer. Fear took him, ran back past stones shouting wildly: ‘Sam! Sam! Merry! Pippin!’ The pony bolted mist vanished. From way off, seemed, thought heard cry: ‘Hoy! Frodo! Hoy!’ It away eastward, left stood great stones, staring straining gloom. He plunged direction call, found going steeply uphill. As struggled called again, kept calling frantically; heard answer time, seemed faint far ahead high him. ‘Frodo! Hoy!’ came thin voices mist: cry sounded like help, help! often repeated, ending last help! trailed long wail suddenly cut short. He stumbled forward speed could towards cries; light gone, clinging night closed him, impossible sure direction. He seemed time climbing up. Only change level ground feet told last came top ridge hill. He weary, sweating yet chilled. It wholly dark. ‘Where you?’ cried miserably. There reply. He stood listening. He suddenly aware getting cold, wind beginning blow, icy wind. A change coming weather. The mist flowing past shreds tatters. His breath smoking, darkness less near thick. He looked saw surprise faint stars appearing overhead amid strands hurrying cloud fog. The wind began hiss grass. He imagined suddenly caught muffled cry, made towards it; even went forward mist rolled thrust aside, starry sky unveiled. A glance showed facing southwards round hill-top, must climbed north. Out east biting wind blowing. To right loomed westward stars dark black shape. A great barrow stood there. ‘Where you?’ cried again, angry afraid. ‘Here!’ said voice, deep cold, seemed come ground. ‘I waiting you!’ ‘No!’ said Frodo; run away. His knees gave, fell ground. Nothing happened, sound. Trembling looked up, time see tall dark figure like shadow stars. It leaned him. He thought two eyes, cold though lit pale light seemed come remote distance. Then grip stronger colder iron seized him. The icy touch froze bones, remembered more. * * * When came again, moment could recall nothing except sense dread. Then suddenly knew imprisoned, caught hopelessly; barrow. A Barrow-wight taken him, probably already dreadful spells Barrow-wights whispered tales spoke. He dared move, lay found himself: flat back upon cold stone hands breast. But though fear great seemed part darkness round him, found lay thinking Bilbo Baggins stories, jogging along together lanes Shire talking roads adventures. There seed courage hidden (often deeply, true) heart fattest timid hobbit, waiting final desperate danger make grow. Frodo neither fat timid; indeed, though know it, Bilbo (and Gandalf) thought best hobbit Shire. He thought come end adventure, terrible end, thought hardened him. He found stiffening, final spring; longer felt limp like helpless prey. As lay there, thinking getting hold himself, noticed darkness slowly giving way: pale greenish light growing round him. It first show kind place in, light seemed coming himself, floor beside him, yet reached roof wall. He turned, cold glow saw lying beside Sam, Pippin, Merry. They backs, faces looked deathly pale; clad white. About lay many treasures, gold maybe, though light looked cold unlovely. On heads circlets, gold chains waists, fingers many rings. Swords lay sides, shields feet. But across three necks lay one long naked sword. * * * Suddenly song began: cold murmur, rising falling. The voice seemed far away immeasurably dreary, sometimes high air thin, sometimes like low moan ground. Out formless stream sad horrible sounds, strings words would shape themselves: grim, hard, cold words, heartless miserable. The night railing morning bereaved, cold cursing warmth hungered. Frodo chilled marrow. After song became clearer, dread heart perceived changed incantation: Cold hand heart bone, cold sleep stone: never wake stony bed, never, till Sun fails Moon dead. In black wind stars shall die, still gold let lie, till dark lord lifts hand dead sea withered land. He heard behind head creaking scraping sound. Raising one arm looked, saw pale light kind passage behind turned corner. Round corner long arm groping, walking fingers towards Sam, lying nearest, towards hilt sword lay upon him. At first Frodo felt indeed turned stone incantation. Then wild thought escape came him. He wondered put Ring, whether Barrow-wight would miss him, might find way out. He thought running free grass, grieving Merry, Sam, Pippin, free alive himself. Gandalf would admit nothing else could do. But courage awakened strong: could leave friends easily. He wavered, groping pocket, fought again; arm crept nearer. Suddenly resolve hardened him, seized short sword lay beside him, kneeling stooped low bodies companions. With strength hewed crawling arm near wrist, hand broke off; moment sword splintered hilt. There shriek light vanished. In dark snarling noise. Frodo fell forward Merry, Merry’s face felt cold. All back mind, disappeared first coming fog, came memory house Hill, Tom singing. He remembered rhyme Tom taught them. In small desperate voice began: Ho! Tom Bombadil! name voice seemed grow strong: full lively sound, dark chamber echoed drum trumpet. Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! By water, wood hill, reed willow, By fire, sun moon, harken hear us! Come, Tom Bombadil, need near us! There sudden deep silence, Frodo could hear heart beating. After long slow moment heard plain, far away, coming ground thick walls, answering voice singing: Old Tom Bombadil merry fellow, Bright blue jacket is, boots yellow. None ever caught yet, Tom, master: His songs stronger songs, feet faster. There loud rumbling sound, stones rolling falling, suddenly light streamed in, real light, plain light day. A low door-like opening appeared end chamber beyond Frodo’s feet; Tom’s head (hat, feather, all) framed light sun rising red behind him. The light fell upon floor, upon faces three hobbits lying beside Frodo. They stir, sickly hue left them. They looked deeply asleep. Tom stooped, removed hat, came dark chamber, singing: Get out, old Wight! Vanish sunlight! Shrivel like cold mist, like winds go wailing, Out barren lands far beyond mountains! Come never again! Leave barrow empty! Lost forgotten be, darker darkness, Where gates stand ever shut, till world mended. At words cry part inner end chamber fell crash. Then long trailing shriek, fading away unguessable distance; silence. ‘Come, friend Frodo!’ said Tom. ‘Let us get clean grass! You must help bear them.’ Together carried Merry, Pippin, Sam. As Frodo left barrow last time thought saw severed hand wriggling still, like wounded spider, heap fallen earth. Tom went back again, sound much thumping stamping. When came bearing arms great load treasure: things gold, silver, copper, bronze; many beads chains jewelled ornaments. He climbed green barrow laid top sunshine. There stood, hat hand wind hair, looked upon three hobbits, laid backs upon grass west side mound. Raising right hand said clear commanding voice: Wake merry lads! Wake hear calling! Warm heart limb! The cold stone fallen; Dark door standing wide; dead hand broken. Night Night flown, Gate open! To Frodo’s great joy hobbits stirred, stretched arms, rubbed eyes, suddenly sprang up. They looked amazement, first Frodo, Tom standing large life barrow-top them; thin white rags, crowned belted pale gold, jingling trinkets. ‘What name wonder?’ began Merry, feeling golden circlet slipped one eye. Then stopped, shadow came face, closed eyes. ‘Of course, I remember!’ said. ‘The men Carn Duˆm came us night, worsted. Ah! spear heart!’ He clutched breast. ‘No! No!’ said, opening eyes. ‘What I saying? I dreaming. Where get to, Frodo?’ ‘I thought I lost,’ said Frodo; ‘but I don’t want speak it. Let us think now! Let us go on!’ ‘Dressed like this, sir?’ said Sam. ‘Where clothes?’ He flung circlet, belt, rings grass, looked round helplessly, expected find cloak, jacket, breeches, hobbit-garments lying somewhere hand. ‘You won’t find clothes again,’ said Tom, bounding mound, laughing danced round sunlight. One would thought nothing dangerous dreadful happened; indeed horror faded hearts looked him, saw merry glint eyes. ‘What mean?’ asked Pippin, looking him, half puzzled half amused. ‘Why not?’ But Tom shook head, saying: ‘You’ve found again, deep water. Clothes little loss, escape drowning. Be glad, merry friends, let warm sunlight heat heart limb! Cast cold rags! Run naked grass, Tom goes a-hunting!’ He sprang away hill, whistling calling. Looking Frodo saw running away southwards along green hollow hill next, still whistling crying: Hey! now! Come hoy now! Whither wander? Up, down, near far, here, yonder? Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail Bumpkin, White-socks little lad, old Fatty Lumpkin! So sang, running fast, tossing hat catching it, hidden fold ground: time hey now! hoy now! came floating back wind, shifted round towards south. The air growing warm again. The hobbits ran grass, told them. Then lay basking sun delight wafted suddenly bitter winter friendly clime, people that, long ill bedridden, wake one day find unexpectedly well day full promise. By time Tom returned feeling strong (and hungry). He reappeared, hat first, brow hill, behind came obedient line six ponies: five one more. The last plainly old Fatty Lumpkin: larger, stronger, fatter (and older) ponies. Merry, others belonged, not, fact, given names, answered new names Tom given rest lives. Tom called one one climbed brow stood line. Then Tom bowed hobbits. ‘Here ponies, now!’ said. ‘They’ve sense (in ways) wandering hobbits – sense noses. For sniff danger ahead walk right into; run save themselves, run right way. You must forgive all; though hearts faithful, face fear Barrow-wights made for. See, come again, bringing burdens!’ Merry, Sam, Pippin clothed spare garments packs; soon felt hot, obliged put thicker warmer things brought oncoming winter. ‘Where old animal, Fatty Lumpkin, come from?’ asked Frodo. ‘He’s mine,’ said Tom. ‘My four-legged friend; though I seldom ride him, wanders often far, free upon hillsides. When ponies stayed me, got know Lumpkin; smelt night, quickly ran meet him. I thought he’d look words wisdom take fear away. But now, jolly Lumpkin, old Tom’s going ride. Hey! he’s coming you, set road; needs pony. For cannot easily talk hobbits riding, you’re legs trying trot beside them.’ The hobbits delighted hear this, thanked Tom many times; laughed, said good losing would feel happy till seen safe borders land. ‘I’ve got things do,’ said: ‘my making singing, talking walking, watching country. Tom can’t always near open doors willow-cracks. Tom house mind, Goldberry waiting.’ It still fairly early sun, something nine ten, hobbits turned minds food. Their last meal lunch beside standing stone day before. They breakfasted remainder Tom’s provisions, meant supper, additions Tom brought him. It large meal (considering hobbits circumstances), felt much better it. While eating Tom went mound, looked treasures. Most made pile glistered sparkled grass. He bade lie ‘free finders, birds, beasts, Elves Men, kindly creatures’; spell mound broken scattered Wight ever come back it. He chose pile brooch set blue stones, many-shaded like flax-flowers wings blue butterflies. He looked long it, stirred memory, shaking head, saying last: ‘Here pretty toy Tom lady! Fair long ago wore shoulder. Goldberry shall wear now, forget her!’ For hobbits chose dagger, long, leafshaped, keen, marvellous workmanship, damasked serpent-forms red gold. They gleamed drew black sheaths, wrought strange metal, light strong, set many fiery stones. Whether virtue sheaths spell lay mound, blades seemed untouched time, unrusted, sharp, glittering sun. ‘Old knives long enough swords hobbit-people,’ said. ‘Sharp blades good have, Shire-folk go walking, east, south, far away dark danger.’ Then told blades forged many long years ago Men Westernesse: foes Dark Lord, overcome evil king Carn Duˆm Land Angmar. ‘Few remember them,’ Tom murmured, ‘yet still go wandering, sons forgotten kings walking loneliness, guarding evil things folk heedless.’ The hobbits understand words, spoke vision great expanse years behind them, like vast shadowy plain strode shapes Men, tall grim bright swords, last came one star brow. Then vision faded, back sunlit world. It time start again. They made ready, packing bags lading ponies. Their new weapons hung leather belts jackets, feeling awkward, wondering would use. Fighting occurred one adventures flight would land them. At last set off. They led ponies hill; mounting trotted quickly along valley. They looked back saw top old mound hill, sunlight gold went like yellow flame. Then turned shoulder Downs hidden view. Though Frodo looked every side saw sign great stones standing like gate, long came northern gap rode swiftly through, land fell away them. It merry journey Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside them, them, Fatty Lumpkin, could move much faster girth promised. Tom sang time, chiefly nonsense, else perhaps strange language unknown hobbits, ancient language whose words mainly wonder delight. They went forward steadily, soon saw Road away imagined. Even without fog, sleep mid-day would prevented reaching nightfall day before. The dark line seen line trees line bushes growing edge deep dike steep wall side. Tom said boundary kingdom, long time ago. He seemed remember something sad it, would say much. They climbed dike gap wall, Tom turned due north, bearing somewhat west. The land open fairly level, quickened pace, sun already sinking low last saw line tall trees ahead, knew come back Road many unexpected adventures. They galloped ponies last furlongs, halted long shadows trees. They top sloping bank, Road, dim evening drew on, wound away them. At point ran nearly South-west North-east, right fell quickly wide hollow. It rutted bore many signs recent heavy rain; pools pot-holes full water. They rode bank looked down. There nothing seen. ‘Well, last!’ said Frodo. ‘I suppose haven’t lost two days short cut Forest! But perhaps delay prove useful – may put trail.’ The others looked him. The shadow fear Black Riders came suddenly again. Ever since entered Forest thought chiefly getting back Road; lay beneath feet remember danger pursued them, likely lying wait upon Road itself. They looked anxiously back towards setting sun, Road brown empty. ‘Do think,’ asked Pippin hesitatingly, ‘do think may pursued, tonight?’ ‘No, I hope tonight,’ answered Tom Bombadil; ‘nor perhaps next day. But trust guess; I cannot tell certain. Out east knowledge fails. Tom master Riders Black Land far beyond country.’ All hobbits wished coming them. They felt would know deal Black Riders, anyone did. They would soon going forward lands wholly strange them, beyond vague distant legends Shire, gathering twilight longed home. A deep loneliness sense loss them. They stood silent, reluctant make final parting, slowly became aware Tom wishing farewell, telling good heart ride till dark without halting. ‘Tom give good advice, till day (after luck must go guide you): four miles along Road you’ll come upon village, Bree Bree-hill, doors looking westward. There you’ll find old inn called The Prancing Pony. Barliman Butterbur worthy keeper. There stay night, afterwards morning speed upon way. Be bold, wary! Keep merry hearts, ride meet fortune!’ They begged come least far inn drink them; laughed refused, saying: Tom’s country ends here: pass borders. Tom house mind, Goldberry waiting! Then turned, tossed hat, leaped Lumpkin’s back, rode bank away singing dusk. The hobbits climbed watched sight. ‘I sorry take leave Master Bombadil,’ said Sam. ‘He’s caution mistake. I reckon may go good deal see naught better, queerer. But I won’t deny I’ll glad see Prancing Pony spoke of. I hope it’ll like The Green Dragon away back home! What sort folk Bree?’ ‘There hobbits Bree,’ said Merry, ‘as well Big Folk. I daresay homelike enough. The Pony good inn accounts. My people ride again.’ ‘It may could wish,’ said Frodo; ‘but outside Shire same. Don’t make much home! Please remember – – name Baggins must mentioned. I Mr. Underhill, name must given.’ They mounted ponies rode silently evening. Darkness came quickly, plodded slowly downhill again, last saw lights twinkling distance ahead. Before rose Bree-hill barring way, dark mass misty stars; western flank nestled large village. Towards hurried desiring find fire, door night. Chapter 9 AT THE SIGN OF THE PRANCING PONY Bree chief village Bree-land, small inhabited region, like island empty lands round about. Besides Bree itself, Staddle side hill, Combe deep valley little eastward, Archet edge Chetwood. Lying round Bree-hill villages small country fields tamed woodland miles broad. The Men Bree brown-haired, broad, rather short, cheerful independent: belonged nobody themselves; friendly familiar Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, inhabitants world (or is) usual Big People. According tales original inhabitants descendants first Men ever wandered West middle-world. Few survived turmoils Elder Days; Kings returned Great Sea found Bree-men still there, still now, memory old Kings faded grass. In days Men settled dwellings far west, within hundred leagues Shire. But wild lands beyond Bree mysterious wanderers. The Bree-folk called Rangers, knew nothing origin. They taller darker Men Bree believed strange powers sight hearing, understand languages beasts birds. They roamed southwards, eastwards even far Misty Mountains; rarely seen. When appeared brought news afar, told strange forgotten tales eagerly listened to; Bree-folk make friends them. There also many families hobbits Bree-land; claimed oldest settlement Hobbits world, one founded long even Brandywine crossed Shire colonized. They lived mostly Staddle though Bree itself, especially higher slopes hill, houses Men. The Big Folk Little Folk (as called one another) friendly terms, minding affairs ways, rightly regarding necessary parts Bree-folk. Nowhere else world peculiar (but excellent) arrangement found. The Bree-folk, Big Little, travel much; affairs four villages chief concern. Occasionally Hobbits Bree went far Buckland, Eastfarthing; though little land much day’s riding east Brandywine Bridge, Hobbits Shire seldom visited it. An occasional Bucklander adventurous Took would come Inn night two, even becoming less less usual. The Shire-hobbits referred Bree, others lived beyond borders, Outsiders, took little interest them, considering dull uncouth. There probably many Outsiders scattered West World days people Shire imagined. Some, doubtless, better tramps, ready dig hole bank stay long suited them. But Bree-land, rate, hobbits decent prosperous, rustic distant relatives Inside. It yet forgotten time much coming going Shire Bree. There Bree-blood Brandybucks accounts. The village Bree hundred stone houses Big Folk, mostly Road, nestling hillside windows looking west. On side, running half circle hill back it, deep dike thick hedge inner side. Over Road crossed causeway; pierced hedge barred great gate. There another gate southern corner Road ran village. The gates closed nightfall; inside small lodges gatekeepers. Down Road, swept right go round foot hill, large inn. It built long ago traffic roads far greater. For Bree stood old meeting ways; another ancient road crossed East Road outside dike western end village, former days Men folk various sorts travelled much it. Strange News Bree still saying Eastfarthing, descending days, news North, South, East could heard inn, Shire-hobbits used go often hear it. But Northern Lands long desolate, North Road seldom used: grass-grown, Bree-folk called Greenway. The Inn Bree still there, however, innkeeper important person. His house meeting place idle, talkative, inquisitive among inhabitants, large small, four villages; resort Rangers wanderers, travellers (mostly dwarves) still journeyed East Road, Mountains. It dark, white stars shining, Frodo companions came last Greenway-crossing drew near village. They came West-gate found shut; door lodge beyond it, man sitting. He jumped fetched lantern looked gate surprise. ‘What want, come from?’ asked gruffly. ‘We making inn here,’ answered Frodo. ‘We journeying east cannot go tonight.’ ‘Hobbits! Four hobbits! And what’s more, Shire talk,’ said gatekeeper, softly speaking himself. He stared darkly moment, slowly opened gate let ride through. ‘We don’t often see Shire-folk riding Road night,’ went on, halted moment door. ‘You’ll pardon wondering business takes away east Bree! What may names be, might I ask?’ ‘Our names business own, seem good place discuss them,’ said Frodo, liking look man tone voice. ‘Your business own, doubt,’ said man; ‘but it’s business ask questions nightfall.’ ‘We hobbits Buckland, fancy travel stay inn here,’ put Merry. ‘I Mr. Brandybuck. Is enough you? The Bree-folk used fair-spoken travellers, I heard.’ ‘All right, right!’ said man. ‘I meant offence. But you’ll find maybe folk old Harry gate asking questions. There’s queer folk about. If go The Pony, you’ll find you’re guests.’ He wished good night, said more; Frodo could see lantern-light man still eyeing curiously. He glad hear gate clang behind them, rode forward. He wondered man suspicious, whether anyone asking news party hobbits. Could Gandalf? He might arrived, delayed Forest Downs. But something look voice gatekeeper made uneasy. The man stared hobbits moment, went back house. As soon back turned, dark figure climbed quickly gate melted shadows village street. * * * The hobbits rode gentle slope, passing detached houses, drew outside inn. The houses lookedlargeandstrangetothem.Samstaredupattheinnwith three storeys many windows, felt heart sink. He imagined meeting giants taller trees, creatures even terrifying, time course journey; moment finding first sight Men tall houses quite enough, indeed much dark end tiring day. He pictured black horses standing saddled shadows inn-yard, Black Riders peering dark upper windows. ‘We surely aren’t going stay night, we, sir?’ exclaimed. ‘If hobbit-folk parts, don’t look would willing take us in? It would homelike.’ ‘What’s wrong inn?’ said Frodo. ‘Tom Bombadil recommended it. I expect it’s homelike enough inside.’ Even outside inn looked pleasant house familiar eyes. It front Road, two wings running back land partly cut lower slopes hill, rear second-floor windows level ground. There wide arch leading courtyard two wings, left arch large doorway reached broad steps. The door open light streamed it. Above arch lamp, beneath swung large signboard: fat white pony reared hind legs. Over door painted white letters: prancing pony barliman butterbur. Many lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains. As hesitated outside gloom, someone began singing merry song inside, many cheerful voices joined loudly chorus. They listened encouraging sound moment got ponies. The song ended burst laughter clapping. They led ponies arch, leaving standing yard climbed steps. Frodo went forward nearly bumped short fat man bald head red face. He white apron on, bustling one door another, carrying tray laden full mugs. ‘Can we——’ began Frodo. ‘Half minute, please!’ shouted man shoulder, vanished babel voices cloud smoke. In moment again, wiping hands apron. ‘Good evening, little master!’ said, bending down. ‘What may wanting?’ ‘Beds four, stabling five ponies, managed. Are Mr. Butterbur?’ ‘That’s right! Barliman name. Barliman Butterbur service! You’re Shire, eh?’ said, suddenly clapped hand forehead, trying remember something. ‘Hobbits!’ cried. ‘Now remind of? Might I ask names, sirs?’ ‘Mr. Took Mr. Brandybuck,’ said Frodo; ‘and Sam Gamgee. My name Underhill.’ ‘There now!’ said Mr. Butterbur, snapping fingers. ‘It’s gone again! But it’ll come back, I time think. I’m run feet; I’ll see I you. We don’t often get party Shire nowadays, I sorry make welcome. But crowd already house tonight hasn’t long enough. It never rains pours, say Bree.’ ‘Hi! Nob!’ shouted. ‘Where you, woolly-footed slowcoach? Nob!’ ‘Coming, sir! Coming!’ A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed door, seeing travellers, stopped short stared great interest. ‘Where’s Bob?’ asked landlord. ‘You don’t know? Well, find him! Double sharp! I haven’t got six legs, six eyes neither! Tell Bob there’s five ponies stabled. He must find room somehow.’ Nob trotted grin wink. ‘Well now, I going say?’ said Mr. Butterbur, tapping forehead. ‘One thing drives another, speak. I’m busy tonight, head going round. There’s party came Greenway South last night – strange enough begin with. Then there’s travelling company dwarves going West come evening. And there’s you. If weren’t hobbits, I doubt could house you. But we’ve got room two north wing made special hobbits, place built. On ground floor usually prefer; round windows like it. I hope you’ll comfortable. You’ll wanting supper, I don’t doubt. As soon may be. This way now!’ He led short way passage, opened door. ‘Here nice little parlour!’ said. ‘I hope suit. Excuse now. I’m busy. No time talking. I must trotting. It’s hard work two legs, I don’t get thinner. I’ll look later. If want anything, ring hand-bell, Nob come. If don’t come, ring shout!’ Off went last, left feeling rather breathless. He seemed capable endless stream talk, however busy might be. They found small cosy room. There bit bright fire burning hearth, front low comfortable chairs. There round table, already spread white cloth, large hand-bell. But Nob, hobbit servant, came bustling long thought ringing. He brought candles tray full plates. ‘Will wanting anything drink, masters?’ asked. ‘And shall I show bedrooms, supper got ready?’ They washed middle good deep mugs beer Mr. Butterbur Nob came again. In twinkling table laid. There hot soup, cold meats, blackberry tart, new loaves, slabs butter, half ripe cheese: good plain food, good Shire could show, homelike enough dispel last Sam’s misgivings (already much relieved excellence beer). The landlord hovered round little, prepared leave them. ‘I don’t know whether would care join company, supped,’ said, standing door. ‘Perhaps would rather go beds. Still company would pleased welcome you, mind. We don’t get Outsiders – travellers Shire, I say, begging pardon – often; like hear bit news, story song may mind. But please! Ring bell, lack anything!’ So refreshed encouraged feel end supper (about three quarters hour’s steady going, hindered unnecessary talk) Frodo, Pippin, Sam decided join company. Merry said would stuffy. ‘I shall sit quietly fire bit, perhaps go later sniff air. Mind Ps Qs, don’t forget supposed escaping secret, still high-road far Shire!’ ‘All right!’ said Pippin. ‘Mind yourself! Don’t get lost, don’t forget safer indoors!’ The company big common-room inn. The gathering large mixed, Frodo discovered, eyes got used light. This came chiefly blazing log-fire, three lamps hanging beams dim, half veiled smoke. Barliman Butterbur standing near fire, talking couple dwarves one two strange-looking men. On benches various folk: men Bree, collection local hobbits (sitting chattering together), dwarves, vague figures difficult make away shadows corners. As soon Shire-hobbits entered, chorus welcome Bree-landers. The strangers, especially come Greenway, stared curiously. The landlord introduced newcomers Bree-folk, quickly that, though caught many names, seldom sure names belonged to. The Men Bree seemed rather botanical (and Shirefolk rather odd) names, like Rushlight, Goatleaf, Heathertoes, Appledore, Thistlewool Ferny (not mention Butterbur). Some hobbits similar names. The Mugworts, instance, seemed numerous. But natural names, Banks, Brockhouse, Longholes, Sandheaver, Tunnelly, many used Shire. There several Underhills Staddle, could imagine sharing name without related, took Frodo hearts long-lost cousin. The Bree-hobbits were, fact, friendly inquisitive, Frodo soon found explanation would given. He gave interested history geography (at much wagging heads, although neither words much used Bree-dialect). He said thinking writing book (at silent astonishment), friends wanted collect information hobbits living outside Shire, especially eastern lands. At chorus voices broke out. If Frodo really wanted write book, many ears, would learned enough several chapters minutes. And enough, given whole list names, beginning ‘Old Barliman here’, could go information. But time, Frodo show sign writing book spot, hobbits returned questions doings Shire. Frodo prove communicative, soon found sitting alone corner, listening looking around. The Men Dwarves mostly talking distant events telling news kind becoming familiar. There trouble away South, seemed Men come Greenway move, looking lands could find peace. The Bree-folk sympathetic, plainly ready take large number strangers little land. One travellers, squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow, foretelling people would coming north near future. ‘If room isn’t found them, they’ll find themselves. They’ve right live, folk,’ said loudly. The local inhabitants look pleased prospect. The hobbits pay much attention this, moment seem concern hobbits. Big Folk could hardly beg lodgings hobbit-holes. They interested Sam Pippin, feeling quite home, chatting gaily events Shire. Pippin roused good deal laughter account collapse roof Town Hole Michel Delving: Will Whitfoot, Mayor, fattest hobbit Westfarthing, buried chalk, came like floured dumpling. But several questions asked made Frodo little uneasy. One Breelanders, seemed Shire several times, wanted know Underhills lived related to. Suddenly Frodo noticed strange-looking weatherbeaten man, sitting shadows near wall, also listening intently hobbit-talk. He tall tankard front him, smoking long-stemmed pipe curiously carved. His legs stretched him, showing high boots supple leather fitted well, seen much wear caked mud. A travel-stained cloak heavy dark-green cloth drawn close him, spite heat room wore hood overshadowed face; gleam eyes could seen watched hobbits. ‘Who that?’ Frodo asked, got chance whisper Mr. Butterbur. ‘I don’t think introduced him?’ ‘Him?’ said landlord answering whisper, cocking eye without turning head. ‘I don’t rightly know. He one wandering folk – Rangers call them. He seldom talks: tell rare tale mind. He disappears month, year, pops again. He pretty often last spring; I haven’t seen lately. What right name I’ve never heard: he’s known round Strider. Goes great pace long shanks; though don’t tell nobody cause hurry. But there’s accounting East West, say Bree, meaning Rangers Shire-folk, begging pardon. Funny ask him.’ But moment Mr. Butterbur called away demand ale last remark remained unexplained. Frodo found Strider looking him, heard guessed said. Presently, wave hand nod, invited Frodo come sit him. As Frodo drew near threw back hood, showing shaggy head dark hair flecked grey, pale stern face pair keen grey eyes. ‘I called Strider,’ said low voice. ‘I pleased meet you, Master – Underhill, old Butterbur got name right.’ ‘He did,’ said Frodo stiffly. He felt far comfortable stare keen eyes. ‘Well, Master Underhill,’ said Strider, ‘if I you, I stop young friends talking much. Drink, fire, chance-meeting pleasant enough, but, well – isn’t Shire. There queer folk about. Though I say shouldn’t, may think,’ added wry smile, seeing Frodo’s glance. ‘And even stranger travellers Bree lately,’ went on, watching Frodo’s face. Frodo returned gaze said nothing; Strider made sign. His attention seemed suddenly fixed Pippin. To alarm Frodo became aware ridiculous young Took, encouraged success fat Mayor Michel Delving, actually giving comic account Bilbo’s farewell party. He already giving imitation Speech, drawing near astonishing Disappearance. Frodo annoyed. It harmless enough tale local hobbits, doubt: funny story funny people away beyond River; (old Butterbur, instance) knew thing two, probably heard rumours long ago Bilbo’s vanishing. It would bring name Baggins minds, especially inquiries Bree name. Frodo fidgeted, wondering do. Pippin evidently much enjoying attention getting, become quite forgetful danger. Frodo sudden fear present mood might even mention Ring; might well disastrous. ‘You better something quick!’ whispered Strider ear. Frodo jumped stood table, began talk. The attention Pippin’s audience disturbed. Some hobbits looked Frodo laughed clapped, thinking Mr. Underhill taken much ale good him. Frodo suddenly felt foolish, found (as habit making speech) fingering things pocket. He felt Ring chain, quite unaccountably desire came slip vanish silly situation. It seemed him, somehow, suggestion came outside, someone something room. He resisted temptation firmly, clasped Ring hand, keep hold prevent escaping mischief. At rate gave inspiration. He spoke ‘a suitable words’, would said Shire: We much gratified kindness reception, I venture hope brief visit help renew old ties friendship Shire Bree; hesitated coughed. Everyone room looking him. ‘A song!’ shouted one hobbits. ‘A song! A song!’ shouted others. ‘Come now, master, sing us something haven’t heard before!’ For moment Frodo stood gaping. Then desperation began ridiculous song Bilbo rather fond (and indeed rather proud of, made words himself). It inn; probably came Frodo’s mind then. Here full. Only words now, rule, remembered. There inn, merry old inn beneath old grey hill, And brew beer brown That Man Moon came one night drink fill. The ostler tipsy cat plays five-stringed fiddle; And runs bow, Now squeaking high, purring low, sawing middle. The landlord keeps little dog mighty fond jokes; When there’s good cheer among guests, He cocks ear jests laughs chokes. They also keep horne´d cow proud queen; But music turns head like ale, And makes wave tufted tail dance upon green. And O! rows silver dishes store silver spoons! For Sunday* there’s special pair, And polish care Saturday afternoons. The Man Moon drinking deep, cat began wail; A dish spoon table danced, The cow garden madly pranced, little dog chased tail. The Man Moon took another mug, rolled beneath chair; And dozed dreamed ale, Till sky stars pale, dawn air. Then ostler said tipsy cat: ‘The white horses Moon, They neigh champ silver bits; But master’s drowned wits, Sun’ll rising soon!’ So cat fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle, jig would wake dead: He squeaked sawed quickened tune, While landlord shook Man Moon: ‘It’s three!’ said. They rolled Man slowly hill bundled Moon, While horses galloped rear, And cow came capering like deer, dish ran spoon. * See note 2, III, p. 1462 Now quicker fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle; dog began roar, The cow horses stood heads; The guests bounded beds danced upon floor. With ping pong fiddle-strings broke! cow jumped Moon, And little dog laughed see fun, And Saturday dish went run silver Sunday spoon. The round Moon rolled behind hill Sun raised head. She* hardly believed fiery eyes; For though day, surprise went back bed! There loud long applause. Frodo good voice, song tickled fancy. ‘Where’s old Barley?’ cried. ‘He ought hear this. Bob ought learn cat fiddle, we’d dance.’ They called ale, began shout: ‘Let’s again, master! Come now! Once more!’ They made Frodo another drink, begin song again, many joined in; tune well known, quick picking words. It Frodo’s turn feel pleased himself. He capered table; came second time cow jumped Moon, leaped air. Much vigorously; came down, bang, tray full mugs, slipped, rolled table crash, clatter, bump! The audience opened mouths wide laughter, stopped short gaping silence; singer * Elves (and Hobbits) always refer Sun She. disappeared. He simply vanished, gone slap floor without leaving hole! The local hobbits stared amazement, sprang feet shouted Barliman. All company drew away Pippin Sam, found left alone corner, eyed darkly doubtfully distance. It plain many people regarded companions travelling magician unknown powers purpose. But one swarthy Bree-lander, stood looking knowing half-mocking expression made feel uncomfortable. Presently slipped door, followed squint-eyed southerner: two whispering together good deal evening. Frodo felt fool. Not knowing else do, crawled away tables dark corner Strider, sat unmoved, giving sign thoughts. Frodo leaned back wall took Ring. How came finger could tell. He could suppose handling pocket sang, somehow slipped stuck hand jerk save fall. For moment wondered Ring played trick; perhaps tried reveal response wish command felt room. He like looks men gone out. ‘Well?’ said Strider, reappeared. ‘Why that? Worse anything friends could said! You put foot it! Or I say finger?’ ‘I don’t know mean,’ said Frodo, annoyed alarmed. ‘Oh yes, do,’ answered Strider; ‘but better wait uproar died down. Then, please, Mr. Baggins, I like quiet word you.’ ‘What about?’ asked Frodo, ignoring sudden use proper name. ‘A matter importance – us both,’ answered Strider, looking Frodo eye. ‘You may hear something advantage.’ ‘Very well,’ said Frodo, trying appear unconcerned. ‘I’ll talk later.’ Meanwhile argument going fireplace. Mr. Butterbur come trotting in, trying listen several conflicting accounts event time. ‘I saw him, Mr. Butterbur,’ said hobbit; ‘or leastways I didn’t see him, take meaning. He vanished thin air, manner speaking.’ ‘You don’t say, Mr. Mugwort!’ said landlord, looking puzzled. ‘Yes I do!’ replied Mugwort. ‘And I mean I say, what’s more.’ ‘There’s mistake somewhere,’ said Butterbur, shaking head. ‘There much Mr. Underhill go vanishing thin air; thick air, likely room.’ ‘Well, now?’ cried several voices. ‘How I know? He’s welcome go will, long pays morning. There’s Mr. Took, now: he’s vanished.’ ‘Well, I saw I saw, I saw I didn’t,’ said Mugwort obstinately. ‘And I say there’s mistake,’ repeated Butterbur, picking tray gathering broken crockery. ‘Of course there’s mistake!’ said Frodo. ‘I haven’t vanished. Here I am! I’ve words Strider corner.’ He came forward firelight; company backed away, even perturbed before. They least satisfied explanation crawled away quickly tables fallen. Most Hobbits Men Bree went huff, fancy entertainment evening. One two gave Frodo black look departed muttering among themselves. The Dwarves two three strange Men still remained got said good night landlord, Frodo friends. Before long one left Strider, sat on, unnoticed, wall. Mr. Butterbur seem much put out. He reckoned, probably, house would full many future nights, present mystery thoroughly discussed. ‘Now doing, Mr. Underhill?’ asked. ‘Frightening customers breaking crocks acrobatics!’ ‘I sorry caused trouble,’ said Frodo. ‘It quite unintentional, I assure you. A unfortunate accident.’ ‘All right, Mr. Underhill! But you’re going tumbling, conjuring, whatever was, you’d best warn folk beforehand – warn me. We’re bit suspicious round anything way – uncanny, understand me; don’t take sudden.’ ‘I shan’t anything sort again, Mr. Butterbur, I promise you. And I think I’ll getting bed. We shall making early start. Will see ponies ready eight o’clock?’ ‘Very good! But go, I like word private, Mr. Underhill. Something come back mind I ought tell you. I hope you’ll take amiss. When I’ve seen thing two, I’ll come along room, you’re willing.’ ‘Certainly!’ said Frodo; heart sank. He wondered many private talks would got bed, would reveal. Were people league him? He began suspect even old Butterbur’s fat face concealing dark designs. Chapter 10 STRIDER Frodo, Pippin, Sam made way back parlour. There light. Merry there, fire burned low. It puffed embers blaze thrown couple faggots discovered Strider come them. There calmly sitting chair door! ‘Hallo!’ said Pippin. ‘Who you, want?’ ‘I called Strider,’ answered; ‘and though may forgotten it, friend promised quiet talk me.’ ‘You said I might hear something advantage, I believe,’ said Frodo. ‘What say?’ ‘Several things,’ answered Strider. ‘But, course, I price.’ ‘What mean?’ asked Frodo sharply. ‘Don’t alarmed! I mean this: I tell I know, give good advice – I shall want reward.’ ‘And be, pray?’ said Frodo. He suspected fallen rascal, thought uncomfortably brought little money him. All would hardly satisfy rogue, could spare it. ‘No afford,’ answered Strider slow smile, guessed Frodo’s thoughts. ‘Just this: must take along you, I wish leave you.’ ‘Oh, indeed!’ replied Frodo, surprised, much relieved. ‘Even I wanted another companion, I agree thing, I knew good deal you, business.’ ‘Excellent!’ exclaimed Strider, crossing legs sitting back comfortably. ‘You seem coming senses again, good. You much careless far. Very well! I tell I know, leave reward you. You may glad grant it, heard me.’ ‘Go then!’ said Frodo. ‘What know?’ ‘Too much; many dark things,’ said Strider grimly. ‘But business——’ He got went door, opened quickly looked out. Then shut quietly sat again. ‘I quick ears,’ went on, lowering voice, ‘and though I cannot disappear, I hunted many wild wary things I usually avoid seen, I wish. Now, I behind hedge evening Road west Bree, four hobbits came Downlands. I need repeat said old Bombadil one another; one thing interested me. Please remember, said one them, name Baggins must mentioned. I Mr. Underhill, name must given. That interested much I followed here. I slipped gate behind them. Maybe Mr. Baggins honest reason leaving name behind; so, I advise friends careful.’ ‘I don’t see interest name anyone Bree,’ said Frodo angrily, ‘and I still learn interests you. Mr. Strider may honest reason spying eavesdropping; so, I advise explain it.’ ‘Well answered!’ said Strider laughing. ‘But explanation simple: I looking Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. I wanted find quickly. I learned carrying Shire, well, secret concerned friends. ‘Now, don’t mistake me!’ cried, Frodo rose seat, Sam jumped scowl. ‘I shall take care secret do. And care needed!’ He leaned forward looked them. ‘Watch every shadow!’ said low voice. ‘Black horsemen passed Bree. On Monday one came Greenway, say; another appeared later, coming Greenway south.’ There silence. At last Frodo spoke Pippin Sam: ‘I ought guessed way gatekeeper greeted us,’ said. ‘And landlord seems heard something. Why press us join company? And earth behave foolishly: ought stayed quiet here.’ ‘It would better,’ said Strider. ‘I would stopped going common-room, I could; innkeeper would let see you, take message.’ ‘Do think he——’ began Frodo. ‘No, I don’t think harm old Butterbur. Only altogether like mysterious vagabonds sort.’ Frodo gave puzzled look. ‘Well, I rather rascally look, I not?’ said Strider curl lip queer gleam eye. ‘But I hope shall get know one another better. When do, I hope explain happened end song. For little prank——’ ‘It sheer accident!’ interrupted Frodo. ‘I wonder,’ said Strider. ‘Accident, then. That accident made position dangerous.’ ‘Hardly already,’ said Frodo. ‘I knew horsemen pursuing me; rate seem missed gone away.’ ‘You must count that!’ said Strider sharply. ‘They return. And coming. There others. I know number. I know Riders.’ He paused, eyes cold hard. ‘And folk Bree trusted,’ went on. ‘Bill Ferny, instance. He evil name Bree-land, queer folk call house. You must noticed among company: swarthy sneering fellow. He close one Southern strangers, slipped together ‘‘accident’’. Not Southerners mean well; Ferny, would sell anything anybody; make mischief amusement.’ ‘What Ferny sell, accident got him?’ said Frodo, still determined understand Strider’s hints. ‘News you, course,’ answered Strider. ‘An account performance would interesting certain people. After would hardly need told real name. It seems likely hear night over. Is enough? You like reward: take guide not. But I may say I know lands Shire Misty Mountains, I wandered many years. I older I look. I might prove useful. You leave open road tonight; horsemen watch night day. You may escape Bree, allowed go forward Sun up; won’t go far. They come wild, dark place help. Do wish find you? They terrible!’ The hobbits looked him, saw surprise face drawn pain, hands clenched arms chair. The room quiet still, light seemed grown dim. For sat unseeing eyes walking distant memory listening sounds Night far away. ‘There!’ cried moment, drawing hand across brow. ‘Perhaps I know pursuers do. You fear them, fear enough, yet. Tomorrow escape, can. Strider take paths seldom trodden. Will him?’ There heavy silence. Frodo made answer; mind confused doubt fear. Sam frowned, looked master; last broke out: ‘With leave, Mr. Frodo, I’d say no! This Strider here, warns says take care; I say yes that, let’s begin him. He comes Wild, I never heard good folk. He knows something, that’s plain, I like; it’s reason let go leading us dark place far help, puts it.’ Pippin fidgeted looked uncomfortable. Strider reply Sam, turned keen eyes Frodo. Frodo caught glance looked away. ‘No,’ said slowly. ‘I don’t agree. I think, I think really choose look. You began talk like Bree-folk, voice changed. Still Sam seems right this: I don’t see warn us take care, yet ask us take trust. Why disguise? Who you? What really know – business; know it?’ ‘The lesson caution well learned,’ said Strider grim smile. ‘But caution one thing wavering another. You never get Rivendell own, trust chance. You must make mind. I answer questions, help so. But believe story, trust already? Still is——’ At moment came knock door. Mr. Butterbur arrived candles, behind Nob cans hot water. Strider withdrew dark corner. ‘I’ve come bid good night,’ said landlord, putting candles table. ‘Nob! Take water rooms!’ He came shut door. ‘It’s like this,’ began, hesitating looking troubled. ‘If I’ve done harm, I’m sorry indeed. But one thing drives another, you’ll admit; I’m busy man. But first one thing another week jogged memory, saying goes; late I hope. You see, I asked look hobbits Shire, one name Baggins particular.’ ‘And got me?’ asked Frodo. ‘Ah! know best,’ said landlord, knowingly. ‘I won’t give away; I told Baggins would going name Underhill, I given description fits well enough, I may say so.’ ‘Indeed! Let’s then!’ said Frodo, unwisely interrupting. ‘A stout little fellow red cheeks,’ said Mr. Butterbur solemnly. Pippin chuckled, Sam looked indignant. ‘That won’t help much; goes hobbits, Barley, says me,’ continued Mr. Butterbur glance Pippin. ‘But one taller fairer most, cleft chin: perky chap bright eye. Begging pardon, said it, me.’ ‘He said it? And he?’ asked Frodo eagerly. ‘Ah! That Gandalf, know I mean. A wizard say is, he’s good friend mine, whether no. But I don’t know he’ll say me, I see again: turn ale sour block wood, I shouldn’t wonder. He’s bit hasty. Still what’s done can’t undone.’ ‘Well, done?’ said Frodo, getting impatient slow unravelling Butterbur’s thoughts. ‘Where I?’ said landlord, pausing snapping fingers. ‘Ah, yes! Old Gandalf. Three months back walked right room without knock. Barley, says, I’m morning. Will something me? You’ve name it, I said. I’m hurry, said he, I’ve time myself, I want message took Shire. Have anyone send, trust go? I find someone, I said, tomorrow, maybe, day after. Make tomorrow, says, gave letter. ‘It’s addressed plain enough,’ said Mr. Butterbur, producing letter pocket, reading address slowly proudly (he valued reputation lettered man): Mr. FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON SHIRE. ‘A letter Gandalf!’ cried Frodo. ‘Ah!’ said Mr. Butterbur. ‘Then right name Baggins?’ ‘It is,’ said Frodo, ‘and better give letter once, explain never sent it. That’s came tell me, I suppose, though you’ve taken long time come point.’ Poor Mr. Butterbur looked troubled. ‘You’re right, master,’ said, ‘and I beg pardon. And I’m mortal afraid Gandalf say, harm comes it. But I didn’t keep back a-purpose. I put safe. Then I couldn’t find nobody willing go Shire next day, day after, none folk spare; one thing another drove mind. I’m busy man. I’ll I set matters right, there’s help I give, you’ve name it. ‘Leaving letter aside, I promised Gandalf less. Barley, says me, friend mine Shire, may coming way long, another. He’ll calling Underhill. Mind that! But need ask questions. And I’m him, may trouble, may need help. Do whatever him, I’ll grateful, says. And are, trouble far off, seemingly.’ ‘What mean?’ asked Frodo. ‘These black men,’ said landlord lowering voice. ‘They’re looking Baggins, mean well, I’m hobbit. It Monday, dogs yammering geese screaming. Uncanny, I called it. Nob, came told two black men door asking hobbit called Baggins. Nob’s hair stood end. I bid black fellows off, slammed door them; they’ve asking question way Archet, I hear. And Ranger, Strider, he’s asking questions, too. Tried get see you, you’d bite sup, did.’ ‘He did!’ said Strider suddenly, coming forward light. ‘And much trouble would saved, let in, Barliman.’ The landlord jumped surprise. ‘You!’ cried. ‘You’re always popping up. What want now?’ ‘He’s leave,’ said Frodo. ‘He came offer help.’ ‘Well, know business, maybe,’ said Mr. Butterbur, looking suspiciously Strider. ‘But I plight, I wouldn’t take Ranger.’ ‘Then would take with?’ asked Strider. ‘A fat innkeeper remembers name people shout day? They cannot stay The Pony ever, cannot go home. They long road them. Will go keep black men off?’ ‘Me? Leave Bree! I wouldn’t money,’ said Mr. Butterbur, looking really scared. ‘But can’t stay quiet bit, Mr. Underhill? What queer goings on? What black men after, come from, I’d like know?’ ‘I’m sorry I can’t explain all,’ answered Frodo. ‘I tired worried, it’s long tale. But mean help me, I ought warn danger long I house. These Black Riders: I sure, I think, I fear come from——’ ‘They come Mordor,’ said Strider low voice. ‘From Mordor, Barliman, means anything you.’ ‘Save us!’ cried Mr. Butterbur turning pale; name evidently known him. ‘That worst news come Bree time.’ ‘It is,’ said Frodo. ‘Are still willing help me?’ ‘I am,’ said Mr. Butterbur. ‘More ever. Though I don’t know likes against, against——’ faltered. ‘Against Shadow East,’ said Strider quietly. ‘Not much, Barliman, every little helps. You let Mr. Underhill stay tonight, Mr. Underhill; forget name Baggins, till far away.’ ‘I’ll that,’ said Butterbur. ‘But they’ll find he’s without help me, I’m afraid. It’s pity Mr. Baggins drew attention evening, say more. The story Mr. Bilbo’s going heard tonight Bree. Even Nob guessing slow pate; others Bree quicker uptake is.’ ‘Well, hope Riders won’t come back yet,’ said Frodo. ‘I hope not, indeed,’ said Butterbur. ‘But spooks spooks, won’t get The Pony easy. Don’t worry till morning. Nob’ll say word. No black man shall pass doors, I stand legs. Me folk’ll keep watch tonight; best get sleep, can.’ ‘In case must called dawn,’ said Frodo. ‘We must get offas early possible. Breakfastat six-thirty, please.’ ‘Right! I’ll see orders,’ said landlord. ‘Good night, Mr. Baggins – Underhill, I say! Good night – now, bless me! Where’s Mr. Brandybuck?’ ‘I don’t know,’ said Frodo sudden anxiety. They forgotten Merry, getting late. ‘I afraid out. He said something going breath air.’ ‘Well, want looking mistake: party might holiday!’ said Butterbur. ‘I must go bar doors quick, I’ll see friend let comes. I’d better send Nob look him. Good night all!’ At last Mr. Butterbur went out, another doubtful look Strider shake head. His footsteps retreated passage. ‘Well?’saidStrider.‘Whenareyougoingtoopenthatletter?’ Frodolooked carefully seal broke it. It seemed certainly Gandalf’s. Inside, written wizard’s strong graceful script, following message: THE PRANCING PONY, BREE. Midyear’s Day, Shire Year, 1418. Dear Frodo, Bad news reached here. I must go once. You better leave Bag End soon, get Shire end July latest. I return soon I can; I follow you, I find gone. Leave message here, pass Bree. You trust landlord (Butterbur). You may meet friend mine Road: Man, lean, dark, tall, called Strider. He knows business help you. Make Rivendell. There I hope may meet again. If I come, Elrond advise you. Yours haste GANDALF. PS. Do NOT use It again, reason whatever! Do travel night! PPS. Make sure real Strider. There many strange men roads. His true name Aragorn. All gold glitter, Not wander lost; The old strong wither, Deep roots reached frost. From ashes fire shall woken, A light shadows shall spring; Renewed shall blade broken, The crownless shall king. PPPS. I hope Butterbur sends promptly. A worthy man, memory like lumberroom: thing wanted always buried. If forgets, I shall roast him. Fare Well! Frodo read letter himself, passed Pippin Sam. ‘Really old Butterbur made mess things!’ said. ‘He deserves roasting. If I got once, might safe Rivendell now. But happened Gandalf? He writes going great danger.’ ‘He many years,’ said Strider. Frodo turned looked thoughtfully, wondering Gandalf’s second postscript. ‘Why didn’t tell Gandalf’s friend once?’ asked. ‘It would saved time.’ ‘Would it? Would believed till now?’ said Strider. ‘I knew nothing letter. For I knew I persuade trust without proofs, I help you. In case, I intend tell once. I study first, make sure you. The Enemy set traps now. As soon I made mind, I ready tell whatever asked. But I must admit,’ added queer laugh, ‘that I hoped would take sake. A hunted man sometimes wearies distrust longs friendship. But there, I believe looks me.’ ‘They – first sight rate,’ laughed Pippin sudden relief reading Gandalf’s letter. ‘But handsome handsome does, say Shire; I daresay shall look much lying days hedges ditches.’ ‘It would take days, weeks, years, wandering Wild make look like Strider,’ answered. ‘And would die first, unless made sterner stuff look be.’ Pippin subsided; Sam daunted, still eyed Strider dubiously. ‘How know Strider Gandalf speaks about?’ demanded. ‘You never mentioned Gandalf, till letter came out. You might play-acting spy, I see, trying get us go you. You might done real Strider took clothes. What say that?’ ‘That stout fellow,’ answered Strider; ‘but I afraid answer you, Sam Gamgee, this. If I killed real Strider, I could kill you. And I killed already without much talk. If I Ring, I could – now!’ He stood up, seemed suddenly grow taller. In eyes gleamed light, keen commanding. Throwing back cloak, laid hand hilt sword hung concealed side. They dare move. Sam sat wide-mouthed staring dumbly. ‘But I real Strider, fortunately,’ said, looking face softened sudden smile. ‘I Aragorn son Arathorn; life death I save you, I will.’ There long silence. At last Frodo spoke hesitation. ‘I believed friend letter came,’ said, ‘or least I wished to. You frightened several times tonight, never way servants Enemy would, I imagine. I think one spies would – well, seem fairer feel fouler, understand.’ ‘I see,’ laughed Strider. ‘I look foul feel fair. Is it? All gold glitter, wander lost.’ ‘Did verses apply then?’ asked Frodo. ‘I could make about. But know Gandalf’s letter, never seen it?’ ‘I know,’ answered. ‘But I Aragorn, verses go name.’ He drew sword, saw blade indeed broken foot hilt. ‘Not much use it, Sam?’ said Strider. ‘But time near shall forged anew.’ Sam said nothing. ‘Well,’ said Strider, ‘with Sam’s permission call settled. Strider shall guide. And I think time went bed took rest can. We shall rough road tomorrow. Even allowed leave Bree unhindered, hardly hope leave unnoticed. But I shall try get lost soon possible. I know one two ways Bree-land main road. If shake pursuit, I shall make Weathertop.’ ‘Weathertop?’ said Sam. ‘What’s that?’ ‘It hill, north Road, half way Rivendell. It commands wide view round; shall chance look us. Gandalf make point, follows us. After Weathertop journey become difficult, shall choose various dangers.’ ‘When last see Gandalf?’ asked Frodo. ‘Do know is, doing?’ Strider looked grave. ‘I know,’ said. ‘I came west spring. I often kept watch borders Shire last years, busy elsewhere. He seldom left unguarded. We last met first May: Sarn Ford Brandywine. He told business gone well, would starting Rivendell last week September. As I knew side, I went away journey own. And proved ill; plainly news reached him, I hand help. ‘I troubled, first time since I known him. We messages, even could come himself. When I returned, many days ago, I heard ill news. The tidings gone far wide Gandalf missing horsemen seen. It Elven-folk Gildor told this; later told left home; news leaving Buckland. I watching East Road anxiously.’ ‘Do think Black Riders anything – Gandalf’s absence, I mean?’ asked Frodo. ‘I know anything else could hindered him, except Enemy himself,’ said Strider. ‘But give hope! Gandalf greater Shire-folk know – rule see jokes toys. But business greatest task.’ Pippin yawned. ‘I sorry,’ said, ‘but I dead tired. In spite danger worry I must go bed, sleep I sit. Where silly fellow, Merry? It would last straw, go dark look him.’ At moment heard door slam; feet came running along passage. Merry came rush followed Nob. He shut door hastily, leaned it. He breath. They stared alarm moment gasped: ‘I seen them, Frodo! I seen them! Black Riders!’ ‘Black Riders!’ cried Frodo. ‘Where?’ ‘Here. In village. I stayed indoors hour. Then come back, I went stroll. I come back standing outside light lamp looking stars. Suddenly I shivered felt something horrible creeping near: sort deeper shade among shadows across road, beyond edge lamplight. It slid away dark without sound. There horse.’ ‘Which way go?’ asked Strider, suddenly sharply. Merry started, noticing stranger first time. ‘Go on!’ said Frodo. ‘This friend Gandalf’s. I explain later.’ ‘It seemed make Road, eastward,’ continued Merry. ‘I tried follow. Of course, vanished almost once; I went round corner far last house Road.’ Strider looked Merry wonder. ‘You stout heart,’ said; ‘but foolish.’ ‘I don’t know,’ said Merry. ‘Neither brave silly, I think. I could hardly help myself. I seemed drawn somehow. Anyway, I went, suddenly I heard voices hedge. One muttering; whispering, hissing. I couldn’t hear word said. I creep closer, I began tremble over. Then I felt terrified, I turned back, going bolt home, something came behind I . . . I fell over.’ ‘I found him, sir,’ put Nob. ‘Mr. Butterbur sent lantern. I went West-gate, back towards South-gate. Just nigh Bill Ferny’s house I thought I could see something Road. I couldn’t swear it, looked two men stooping something, lifting it. I gave shout, I got spot signs them, Mr. Brandybuck lying roadside. He seemed asleep. ‘‘I thought I fallen deep water,’’ says me, I shook him. Very queer was, soon I roused him, got ran back like hare.’ ‘I afraid that’s true,’ said Merry, ‘though I don’t know I said. I ugly dream, I can’t remember. I went pieces. I don’t know came me.’ ‘I do,’ said Strider. ‘The Black Breath. The Riders must left horses outside, passed back South-gate secret. They know news now, visited Bill Ferny; probably Southerner spy well. Something may happen night, leave Bree.’ ‘What happen?’ said Merry. ‘Will attack inn?’ ‘No, I think not,’ said Strider. ‘They yet. And case way. In dark loneliness strongest; openly attack house lights many people – desperate, long leagues Eriador still lie us. But power terror, already Bree clutch. They drive wretches evil work: Ferny, strangers, and, maybe, gatekeeper too. They words Harry West-gate Monday. I watching them. He white shaking left him.’ ‘We seem enemies round,’ said Frodo. ‘What do?’ ‘Stay here, go rooms! They sure found are. The hobbit-rooms windows looking north close ground. We remain together bar window door. But first Nob I fetch luggage.’ While Strider gone, Frodo gave Merry rapid account happened since supper. Merry still reading pondering Gandalf’s letter Strider Nob returned. ‘Well Masters,’ said Nob, ‘I’ve ruffled clothes put bolster middle bed. And I made nice imitation head brown woollen mat, Mr. Bag – Underhill, sir,’ added grin. Pippin laughed. ‘Very life-like!’ said. ‘But happen penetrated disguise?’ ‘We shall see,’ said Strider. ‘Let us hope hold fort till morning.’ ‘Good night you,’ said Nob, went take part watch doors. Their bags gear piled parlour-floor. They pushed low chair door shut window. Peering out, Frodo saw night still clear. The Sickle* swinging bright shoulders Bree-hill. He closed barred heavy inside shutters drew curtains together. Strider built fire blew candles. The hobbits lay blankets feet towards hearth; Strider settled chair door. They talked little, Merry still several questions ask. ‘Jumped Moon!’ chuckled Merry rolled blanket. ‘Very ridiculous you, Frodo! But I wish * The Hobbits’ name Plough Great Bear. I see. The worthies Bree discussing hundred years hence.’ ‘I hope so,’ said Strider. Then fell silent, one one hobbits dropped sleep. Chapter 11 A KNIFE IN THE DARK As prepared sleep inn Bree, darkness lay Buckland; mist strayed dells along river-bank. The house Crickhollow stood silent. Fatty Bolger opened door cautiously peered out. A feeling fear growing day, unable rest go bed: brooding threat breathless night-air. As stared gloom, black shadow moved trees; gate seemed open accord close without sound. Terror seized him. He shrank back, moment stood trembling hall. Then shut locked door. The night deepened. There came soft sound horses led stealth along lane. Outside gate stopped, three black figures entered, like shades night creeping across ground. One went door, one corner house either side; stood, still shadows stones, night went slowly on. The house quiet trees seemed waiting breathlessly. There faint stir leaves, cock crowed far away. The cold hour dawn passing. The figure door moved. In dark without moon stars drawn blade gleamed, chill light unsheathed. There blow, soft heavy, door shuddered. ‘Open, name Mordor!’ said voice thin menacing. At second blow door yielded fell back, timbers burst lock broken. The black figures passed swiftly in. At moment, among trees nearby, horn rang out. It rent night like fire hill-top. awake! fear! fire! foes! awake! Fatty Bolger idle. As soon saw dark shapes creep garden, knew must run it, perish. And run did, back door, garden, fields. When reached nearest house, mile away, collapsed doorstep. ‘No, no, no!’ crying. ‘No, me! I haven’t got it!’ It time anyone could make babbling about. At last got idea enemies Buckland, strange invasion Old Forest. And lost time. fear! fire! foes! The Brandybucks blowing Horn-call Buckland, sounded hundred years, since white wolves came Fell Winter, Brandywine frozen over. awake! awake! Far away answering horns heard. The alarm spreading. The black figures fled house. One let fall hobbit-cloak step, ran. In lane noise hoofs broke out, gathering gallop, went hammering away darkness. All Crickhollow sound horns blowing, voices crying feet running. But Black Riders rode like gale North-gate. Let little people blow! Sauron would deal later. Meanwhile another errand: knew house empty Ring gone. They rode guards gate vanished Shire. * * * In early night Frodo woke deep sleep, suddenly, sound presence disturbed him. He saw Strider sitting alert chair: eyes gleamed light fire, tended burning brightly; made sign movement. Frodo soon went sleep again; dreams troubled noise wind galloping hoofs. The wind seemed curling round house shaking it; far heard horn blowing wildly. He opened eyes, heard cock crowing lustily inn-yard. Strider drawn curtains pushed back shutters clang. The first grey light day room, cold air coming open window. As soon Strider roused all, led way bedrooms. When saw glad taken advice: windows forced open swinging, curtains flapping; beds tossed about, bolsters slashed flung upon floor; brown mat torn pieces. Strider immediately went fetch landlord. Poor Mr. Butterbur looked sleepy frightened. He hardly closed eyes night (so said), never heard sound. ‘Never thing happened time!’ cried, raising hands horror. ‘Guests unable sleep beds, good bolsters ruined all! What coming to?’ ‘Dark times,’ said Strider. ‘But present may left peace, got rid us. We leave once. Never mind breakfast: drink bite standing do. We shall packed minutes.’ Mr. Butterbur hurried see ponies got ready, fetch ‘bite’. But soon came back dismay. The ponies vanished! The stable-doors opened night, gone: Merry’s ponies, every horse beast place. Frodo crushed news. How could hope reach Rivendell foot, pursued mounted enemies? They might well set Moon. Strider sat silent while, looking hobbits, weighing strength courage. ‘Ponies would help us escape horsemen,’ said last, thoughtfully, guessed Frodo mind. ‘We go much slower foot, roads I mean take. I going walk case. It food stores trouble me. We cannot count getting anything eat Rivendell, except take us; ought take plenty spare; may delayed, forced go round-about, far direct way. How much prepared carry backs?’ ‘As much must,’ said Pippin sinking heart, trying show tougher looked (or felt). ‘I carry enough two,’ said Sam defiantly. ‘Can’t anything done, Mr. Butterbur?’ asked Frodo. ‘Can’t get couple ponies village, even one baggage? I don’t suppose could hire them, might able buy them,’ added, doubtfully, wondering could afford it. ‘I doubt it,’ said landlord unhappily. ‘The two three riding-ponies Bree stabled yard, they’re gone. As animals, horses ponies draught not, Bree, won’t sale. But I’ll I can. I’ll rout Bob send round soon may be.’ ‘Yes,’ said Strider reluctantly, ‘you better that. I afraid shall try get one pony least. But ends hope starting early, slipping away quietly! We might well blown horn announce departure. That part plan, doubt.’ ‘There one crumb comfort,’ said Merry, ‘and crumb, I hope: breakfast wait – sit it. Let’s get hold Nob!’ * * * In end three hours’ delay. Bob came back report horse pony got love money neighbourhood – except one: Bill Ferny one might possibly sell. ‘A poor old half-starved creature is,’ said Bob; ‘but won’t part less thrice worth, seeing you’re placed, I knows Bill Ferny.’ ‘Bill Ferny?’ said Frodo. ‘Isn’t trick? Wouldn’t beast bolt back stuff, help tracking us, something?’ ‘I wonder,’ said Strider. ‘But I cannot imagine animal running home him, got away. I fancy afterthought kind Master Ferny’s: way increasing profits affair. The chief danger poor beast probably death’s door. But seem choice. What want it?’ Bill Ferny’s price twelve silver pennies; indeed least three times pony’s value parts. It proved bony, underfed, dispirited animal; look like dying yet. Mr. Butterbur paid himself, offered Merry another eighteen pence compensation lost animals. He honest man, well-off things reckoned Bree; thirty silver pennies sore blow him, cheated Bill Ferny made harder bear. As matter fact came right side end. It turned later one horse actually stolen. The others driven off, bolted terror, found wandering different corners Bree-land. Merry’s ponies escaped altogether, eventually (having good deal sense) made way Downs search Fatty Lumpkin. So came care Tom Bombadil while, welloff. But news events Bree came Tom’s ears, sent Mr. Butterbur, thus got five good beasts fair price. They work harder Bree, Bob treated well; whole lucky: missed dark dangerous journey. But never came Rivendell. However, meanwhile Mr. Butterbur knew money gone good, bad. And troubles. For great commotion soon remaining guests astir heard news raid inn. The southern travellers lost several horses blamed innkeeper loudly, became known one number also disappeared night, none Bill Ferny’s squint-eyed companion. Suspicion fell once. ‘If pick horse-thief, bring house,’ said Butterbur angrily, ‘you ought pay damage come shouting me. Go ask Ferny handsome friend is!’ But appeared nobody’s friend, nobody could recollect joined party. After breakfast hobbits re-pack, get together supplies longer journey expecting. It close ten o’clock last got off. By time whole Bree buzzing excitement. Frodo’s vanishing trick; appearance black horsemen; robbing stables; least news Strider Ranger joined mysterious hobbits, made tale would last many uneventful years. Most inhabitants Bree Staddle, many even Combe Archet, crowded road see travellers start. The guests inn doors hanging windows. Strider changed mind, decided leave Bree main road. Any attempt set across country would make matters worse: half inhabitants would follow them, see to, prevent trespassing. They said farewell Nob Bob, took leave Mr. Butterbur many thanks. ‘I hope shall meet day, things merry more,’ said Frodo. ‘I like nothing better stay house peace while.’ They tramped off, anxious downhearted, eyes crowd. Not faces friendly, words shouted. But Strider seemed held awe Bree-landers, stared shut mouths drew away. He walked front Frodo; next came Merry Pippin; last came Sam leading pony, laden much baggage heart give it; already looked less dejected, approved change fortunes. Sam chewing apple thoughtfully. He pocket full them: parting present Nob Bob. ‘Apples walking, pipe sitting,’ said. ‘But I reckon I’ll miss long.’ The hobbits took notice inquisitive heads peeped doors, popped walls fences, passed. But drew near gate, Frodo saw dark ill-kept house behind thick hedge: last house village. In one windows caught glimpse sallow face sly, slanting eyes; vanished once. ‘So that’s southerner hiding!’ thought. ‘He looks half like goblin.’ Over hedge another man staring boldly. He heavy black brows, dark scornful eyes; large mouth curled sneer. He smoking short black pipe. As approached took mouth spat. ‘Morning, Longshanks!’ said. ‘Off early? Found friends last?’ Strider nodded, answer. ‘Morning, little friends!’ said others. ‘I suppose know you’ve taken with? That’s Stick-atnaught Strider, is! Though I’ve heard names pretty. Watch tonight! And you, Sammie, don’t go ill-treating poor old pony! Pah!’ He spat again. Sam turned quickly. ‘And you, Ferny,’ said, ‘put ugly face sight, get hurt.’ With sudden flick, quick lightning, apple left hand hit Bill square nose. He ducked late, curses came behind hedge. ‘Waste good apple,’ said Sam regretfully, strode on. At last left village behind. The escort children stragglers followed got tired turned back South-gate. Passing through, kept along Road miles. It bent left, curving back eastward line rounded feet Bree-hill, began run swiftly downwards wooded country. To left could see houses hobbit-holes Staddle gentler south-eastern slopes hill; deep hollow away north Road wisps rising smoke showed Combe lay; Archet hidden trees beyond. After Road run way, left Bree-hill standing tall brown behind, came narrow track led towards North. ‘This leave open take cover,’ said Strider. ‘Not ‘‘short cut’’, I hope,’ said Pippin. ‘Our last short cut woods nearly ended disaster.’ ‘Ah, got then,’ laughed Strider. ‘My cuts, short long, don’t go wrong.’ He took look Road. No one sight; led way quickly towards wooded valley. His plan, far could understand without knowing country, go towards Archet first, bear right pass east, steer straight could wild lands Weathertop Hill. In way would, went well, cut great loop Road, bent southwards avoid Midgewater Marshes. But, course, would pass marshes themselves, Strider’s description encouraging. However, meanwhile, walking unpleasant. Indeed, disturbing events night before, would enjoyed part journey better time. The sun shining, clear hot. The woods valley still leafy full colour, seemed peaceful wholesome. Strider guided confidently among many crossing paths, although left would soon loss. He taking wandering course many turns doublings, put pursuit. ‘Bill Ferny watched left Road, certain,’ said; ‘though I don’t think follow us himself. He knows land round well enough, knows match wood. It may tell others I afraid of. I don’t suppose far away. If think made Archet, much better.’ Whether Strider’s skill reason, saw sign heard sound living thing day: neither two-footed, except birds; four-footed, except one fox squirrels. The next day began steer steady course eastwards; still quiet peaceful. On third day Bree came Chetwood. The land falling steadily, ever since turned aside Road, entered wide flat expanseofcountry,muchmoredifficulttomanage.Theywere far beyond borders Bree-land, pathless wilderness, drawing near Midgewater Marshes. The ground became damp, places boggy came upon pools, wide stretches reeds rushes filled warbling little hidden birds. They pick way carefully keep dry-footed proper course. At first made fair progress, went on, passage became slower dangerous. The marshes bewildering treacherous, permanent trail even Rangers find shifting quagmires. The flies began torment them, air full clouds tiny midges crept sleeves breeches hair. ‘I eaten alive!’ cried Pippin. ‘Midgewater! There midges water!’ ‘What live can’t get hobbit?’ asked Sam, scratching neck. They spent miserable day lonely unpleasant country. Their camping-place damp, cold, uncomfortable; biting insects would let sleep. There also abominable creatures haunting reeds tussocks sound evil relatives cricket. There thousands them, squeaked round, neek-breek, breek-neek, unceasingly night, hobbits nearly frantic. The next day, fourth, little better, night almost comfortless. Though Neekerbreekers (as Sam called them) left behind, midges still pursued them. As Frodo lay, tired unable close eyes, seemed far away came light eastern sky: flashed faded many times. It dawn, still hours off. ‘What light?’ said Strider, risen, standing, gazing ahead night. ‘I know,’ Strider answered. ‘It distant make out. It like lightning leaps hill-tops.’ Frodo lay again, long could still see white flashes, tall dark figure Strider, standing silent watchful. At last passed uneasy sleep. They gone far fifth day left last straggling pools reed-beds marshes behind them. The land began steadily rise again. Away distance eastward could see line hills. The highest right line little separated others. It conical top, slightly flattened summit. ‘That Weathertop,’ said Strider. ‘The Old Road, left far away right, runs south passes far foot. We might reach noon tomorrow, go straight towards it. I suppose better so.’ ‘What mean?’ asked Frodo. ‘I mean: get there, certain shall find. It close Road.’ ‘But surely hoping find Gandalf there?’ ‘Yes; hope faint. If comes way all, may pass Bree, may know doing. And anyway, unless luck arrive almost together, shall miss one another; safe us wait long. If Riders fail find us wilderness, likely make Weathertop themselves. It commands wide view round. Indeed, many birds beasts country could see us, stand here, hill-top. Not birds trusted, spies evil are.’ The hobbits looked anxiously distant hills. Sam looked pale sky, fearing see hawks eagles hovering bright unfriendly eyes. ‘You make feel uncomfortable lonesome, Strider!’ said. ‘What advise us do?’ asked Frodo. ‘I think,’ answered Strider slowly, quite sure, ‘I think best thing go straight eastward can, make line hills, Weathertop. There strike path I know runs feet; bring us Weathertop north less openly. Then shall see shall see.’ All day plodded along, cold early evening came down. The land became drier barren; mists vapours lay behind marshes. A melancholy birds piping wailing, round red sun sank slowly western shadows; empty silence fell. The hobbits thought soft light sunset glancing cheerful windows Bag End far away. At day’s end came stream wandered hills lose stagnant marshland, went along banks light lasted. It already night last halted made camp stunted alder-trees shores stream. Ahead loomed dusky sky bleak treeless backs hills. That night set watch, Strider, seemed, sleep all. The moon waxing, early night-hours cold grey light lay land. Next morning set soon sunrise. There frost air, sky pale clear blue. The hobbits felt refreshed, night unbroken sleep. Already getting used much walking short commons – shorter rate Shire would thought barely enough keep legs. Pippin declared Frodo looking twice hobbit been. ‘Very odd,’ said Frodo, tightening belt, ‘considering actually good deal less me. I hope thinning process go indefinitely, I shall become wraith.’ ‘Do speak things!’ said Strider quickly, surprising earnestness. The hills drew nearer. They made undulating ridge, often rising almost thousand feet, falling low clefts passes leading eastern land beyond. Along crest ridge hobbits could see looked remains green-grown walls dikes, clefts still stood ruins old works stone. By night reached feet westward slopes, camped. It night fifth October, six days Bree. In morning found, first time since left Chetwood, track plain see. They turned right followed southwards. It ran cunningly, taking line seemed chosen keep much hidden possible view, hill-tops flats west. It dived dells, hugged steep banks; passed flatter open ground either side lines large boulders hewn stones screened travellers almost like hedge. ‘I wonder made path, for,’ said Merry, walked along one avenues, stones unusually large closely set. ‘I sure I like it: – well, rather barrow-wightish look. Is barrow Weathertop?’ ‘No. There barrow Weathertop, hills,’ answered Strider. ‘The Men West live here; though latter days defended hills evil came Angmar. This path made serve forts along walls. But long before, first days North Kingdom, built great watch-tower Weathertop, Amon Suˆl called it. It burned broken, nothing remains tumbled ring, like rough crown old hill’s head. Yet tall fair. It told Elendil stood watching coming Gil-galad West, days Last Alliance.’ The hobbits gazed Strider. It seemed learned old lore, well ways wild. ‘Who Gil-galad?’ asked Merry; Strider answer, seemed lost thought. Suddenly low voice murmured: Gil-galad Elven-king. Of harpers sadly sing: last whose realm fair free Mountains Sea. His sword long, lance keen, shining helm afar seen; countless stars heaven’s field mirrored silver shield. But long ago rode away, dwelleth none say; darkness fell star Mordor shadows are. The others turned amazement, voice Sam’s. ‘Don’t stop!’ said Merry. ‘That’s I know,’ stammered Sam, blushing. ‘I learned Mr. Bilbo I lad. He used tell tales like that, knowing I always one hearing Elves. It Mr. Bilbo taught letters. He mighty book-learned dear old Mr. Bilbo. And wrote poetry. He wrote I said.’ ‘He make up,’ said Strider. ‘It part lay called The Fall Gil-galad, ancient tongue. Bilbo must translated it. I never knew that.’ ‘There lot more,’ said Sam, ‘all Mordor. I didn’t learn part, gave shivers. I never thought I going way myself!’ ‘Going Mordor!’ cried Pippin. ‘I hope won’t come that!’ ‘Do speak name loudly!’ said Strider. It already mid-day drew near southern end path, saw them, pale clear light October sun, grey-green bank, leading like bridge northward slope hill. They decided make top once, daylight broad. Concealment longer possible, could hope enemy spy observing them. Nothing seen moving hill. If Gandalf anywhere about, sign him. On western flank Weathertop found sheltered hollow, bottom bowl-shaped dell grassy sides. There left Sam Pippin pony packs luggage. The three went on. After half hour’s plodding climb Strider reached crown hill; Frodo Merry followed, tired breathless. The last slope steep rocky. On top found, Strider said, wide ring ancient stone-work, crumbling covered age-long grass. But centre cairn broken stones piled. They blackened fire. About turf burned roots within ring grass scorched shrivelled, flames swept hilltop; sign living thing. Standing upon rim ruined circle, saw round wide prospect, part lands empty featureless, except patches woodland away south, beyond caught glint distant water. Beneath southern side ran like ribbon Old Road, coming West winding down, faded behind ridge dark land east. Nothing moving it. Following line eastward eyes saw Mountains: nearer foothills brown sombre; behind stood taller shapes grey, behind high white peaks glimmering among clouds. ‘Well, are!’ said Merry. ‘And cheerless uninviting looks! There water shelter. And sign Gandalf. But I don’t blame waiting – ever came here.’ ‘I wonder,’ said Strider, looking round thoughtfully. ‘Even day two behind us Bree, could arrived first. He ride swiftly need presses.’ Suddenly stooped looked stone top cairn; flatter others, whiter, escaped fire. He picked examined it, turning fingers. ‘This handled recently,’ said. ‘What think marks?’ On flat under-side Frodo saw scratches: . ‘There seems stroke, dot, three strokes,’ said. ‘The stroke left might G-rune thin branches,’ said Strider. ‘It might sign left Gandalf, though one cannot sure. The scratches fine, certainly look fresh. But marks might mean something quite different, nothing us. Rangers use runes, come sometimes.’ ‘What could mean, even Gandalf made them?’ asked Merry. ‘I say,’ answered Strider, ‘that stood G3, sign Gandalf October third: three days ago now. It would also show hurry danger hand, time dare write anything longer plainer. If so, must wary.’ ‘I wish could feel sure made marks, whatever may mean,’ said Frodo. ‘It would great comfort know way, front us behind us.’ ‘Perhaps,’ said Strider. ‘For myself, I believe here, danger. There scorching flames here; light saw three nights ago eastern sky comes back mind. I guess attacked hill-top, result I cannot tell. He longer, must look make way Rivendell, best can.’ ‘How far Rivendell?’ asked Merry, gazing round wearily. The world looked wild wide Weathertop. ‘I don’t know Road ever measured miles beyond Forsaken Inn, day’s journey east Bree,’ answered Strider. ‘Some say far, say otherwise. It strange road, folk glad reach journey’s end, whether time long short. But I know long would take feet, fair weather ill fortune: twelve days Ford Bruinen, Road crosses Loudwater runs Rivendell. We least fortnight’s journey us, I think shall able use Road.’ ‘A fortnight!’ said Frodo. ‘A lot may happen time.’ ‘It may,’ said Strider. They stood silent hill-top, near southward edge. In lonely place Frodo first time fully realized homelessness danger. He wished bitterly fortune left quiet beloved Shire. He stared hateful Road, leading back westward – home. Suddenly aware two black specks moving slowly along it, going westward; looking saw three others creeping eastward meet them. He gave cry clutched Strider’s arm. ‘Look,’ said, pointing downwards. At Strider flung ground behind ruined circle, pulling Frodo beside him. Merry threw alongside. ‘What it?’ whispered. ‘I know, I fear worst,’ answered Strider. Slowly crawled edge ring again, peered cleft two jagged stones. The light longer bright, clear morning faded, clouds creeping East overtaken sun, began go down. They could see black specks, neither Frodo Merry could make shapes certain; yet something told there, far below, Black Riders assembling Road beyond foot hill. ‘Yes,’ said Strider, whose keener sight left doubt. ‘The enemy here!’ Hastily crept away slipped north side hill find companions. Sam Peregrin idle. They explored small dell surrounding slopes. Not far away found spring clear water hillside, near footprints day two old. In dell found recent traces fire, signs hasty camp. There fallen rocks edge dell nearest hill. Behind Sam came upon small store firewood neatly stacked. ‘I wonder old Gandalf here,’ said Pippin. ‘Whoever put stuff meant come back seems.’ Strider greatly interested discoveries. ‘I wish I waited explored ground myself,’ said, hurrying spring examine footprints. ‘It I feared,’ said, came back. ‘Sam Pippin trampled soft ground, marks spoilt confused. Rangers lately. It left firewood behind. But also several newer tracks made Rangers. At least one set made, day two ago, heavy boots. At least one. I cannot certain, I think many booted feet.’ He paused stood anxious thought. Each hobbits saw mind vision cloaked bootedRiders. Ifthe horsemenhad alreadyfound thedell, sooner Strider led somewhere else better. Sam viewed hollow great dislike, heard news enemies Road, miles away. ‘Hadn’t better clear quick, Mr. Strider?’ asked impatiently. ‘It getting late, I don’t like hole: makes heart sink somehow.’ ‘Yes, certainly must decide once,’ answered Strider, looking considering time weather. ‘Well, Sam,’ said last, ‘I like place either; I cannot think anywhere better could reach nightfall. At least sight moment, moved much likely seen spies. All could would go right way back north side line hills, land much here. The Road watched, cross it, tried take cover thickets away south. On north side Road beyond hills country bare flat miles.’ ‘Can Riders see?’ asked Merry. ‘I mean, seem usually used noses rather eyes, smelling us, smelling right word, least daylight. But made us lie flat saw below; talk seen, move.’ ‘I careless hill-top,’ answered Strider. ‘I anxious find sign Gandalf; mistake three us go stand long. For black horses see, Riders use men creatures spies, found Bree. They see world light do, shapes cast shadows minds, noon sun destroys; dark perceive many signs forms hidden us: feared. And times smell blood living things, desiring hating it. Senses, too, sight smell. We feel presence – troubled hearts, soon came here, saw them; feel keenly. Also,’ added, voice sank whisper, ‘the Ring draws them.’ ‘Is escape then?’ said Frodo, looking round wildly. ‘If I move I shall seen hunted! If I stay, I shall draw me!’ Strider laid hand shoulder. ‘There still hope,’ said. ‘You alone. Let us take wood set ready fire sign. There little shelter defence here, fire shall serve both. Sauron put fire evil uses, things, Riders love it, fear wield it. Fire friend wilderness.’ ‘Maybe,’ muttered Sam. ‘It also good way saying ‘‘here are’’ I think of, bar shouting.’ Down lowest sheltered corner dell lit fire, prepared meal. The shades evening began fall, grew cold. They suddenly aware great hunger, eaten anything since breakfast; dared make frugal supper. The lands ahead empty save birds beasts, unfriendly places deserted races world. Rangers passed times beyond hills, stay. Other wanderers rare, evil sort: trolls might stray times northern valleys Misty Mountains. Only Road would travellers found, often dwarves, hurrying along business own, help words spare strangers. ‘I don’t see food made last,’ said Frodo. ‘We careful enough last days, supper feast; used ought, two weeks still go, perhaps more.’ ‘There food wild,’ said Strider; ‘berry, root, herb; I skill hunter need. You need afraid starving winter comes. But gathering catching food long weary work, need haste. So tighten belts, think hope tables Elrond’s house!’ The cold increased darkness came on. Peering edge dell could see nothing grey land vanishing quickly shadow. The sky cleared slowly filled twinkling stars. Frodo companions huddled round fire, wrapped every garment blanket possessed; Strider content single cloak, sat little apart, drawing thoughtfully pipe. As night fell light fire began shine brightly began tell tales keep minds fear. He knew many histories legends long ago, Elves Men good evil deeds Elder Days. They wondered old was, learned lore. ‘Tell us Gil-galad,’ said Merry suddenly, paused end story Elf-kingdoms. ‘Do know old lay spoke of?’ ‘I indeed,’ answered Strider. ‘So also Frodo, concerns us closely.’ Merry Pippin looked Frodo, staring fire. ‘I know little Gandalf told me,’ said Frodo slowly. ‘Gil-galad last great Elf-kings Middle-earth. Gil-galad Starlight tongue. With Elendil, Elf-friend, went land of——’ ‘No!’ said Strider interrupting, ‘I think tale told servants Enemy hand. If win house Elrond, may hear there, told full.’ ‘Then tell us tale old days,’ begged Sam; ‘a tale Elves fading time. I would dearly like hear Elves; dark seems press round close.’ ‘I tell tale Tinu´viel,’ said Strider, ‘in brief – long tale end known; none now, except Elrond, remember aright told old. It fair tale, though sad, tales Middle-earth, yet may lift hearts.’ He silent time, began speak chant softly: The leaves long, grass green, The hemlock-umbels tall fair, And glade light seen Of stars shadow shimmering. Tinu´viel dancing To music pipe unseen, And light stars hair, And raiment glimmering. There Beren came mountains cold, And lost wandered leaves, And Elven-river rolled He walked alone sorrowing. He peered hemlock-leaves And saw wonder flowers gold Upon mantle sleeves, And hair like shadow following. Enchantment healed weary feet That hills doomed roam; And forth hastened, strong fleet, And grasped moonbeams glistening. Through woven woods Elvenhome She lightly fled dancing feet, And left lonely still roam In silent forest listening. He heard oft flying sound Of feet light linden-leaves, Or music welling underground, In hidden hollows quavering. Now withered lay hemlock-sheaves, And one one sighing sound Whispering fell beechen leaves In wintry woodland wavering. He sought ever, wandering far Where leaves years thickly strewn, By light moon ray star In frosty heavens shivering. Her mantle glinted moon, As hill-top high far She danced, feet strewn A mist silver quivering. When winter passed, came again, And song released sudden spring, Like rising lark, falling rain, And melting water bubbling. He saw elven-flowers spring About feet, healed He longed dance sing Upon grass untroubling. Again fled, swift came. Tinu´viel! Tinu´viel! He called Elvish name; And halted listening. One moment stood she, spell His voice laid her: Beren came, And doom fell Tinu´viel That arms lay glistening. As Beren looked eyes Within shadows hair, The trembling starlight skies He saw mirrored shimmering. Tinu´viel elven-fair, Immortal maiden elven-wise, About cast shadowy hair And arms like silver glimmering. Long way fate bore, O’er stony mountains cold grey, Through halls iron darkling door, And woods nightshade morrowless. The Sundering Seas lay, And yet last met more, And long ago passed away In forest singing sorrowless. Strider sighed paused spoke again. ‘That song,’ said, ‘in mode called ann-thennath among Elves, hard render Common Speech, rough echo it. It tells meeting Beren son Barahir Lu´thien Tinu´viel. Beren mortal man, Lu´thien daughter Thingol, King Elves upon Middle-earth world young; fairest maiden ever among children world. As stars mists Northern lands loveliness, face shining light. In days Great Enemy, Sauron Mordor servant, dwelt Angband North, Elves West coming back Middle-earth made war upon regain Silmarils stolen; fathers Men aided Elves. But Enemy victorious Barahir slain, Beren escaping great peril came Mountains Terror hidden Kingdom Thingol forest Neldoreth. There beheld Lu´thien singing dancing glade beside enchanted river Esgalduin; named Tinu´viel, Nightingale language old. Many sorrows befell afterwards, parted long. Tinu´viel rescued Beren dungeons Sauron, together passed great dangers, cast even Great Enemy throne, took iron crown one three Silmarils, brightest jewels, bride-price Lu´thien Thingol father. Yet last Beren slain Wolf came gates Angband, died arms Tinu´viel. But chose mortality, die world, might follow him; sung met beyond Sundering Seas, brief time walking alive green woods, together passed, long ago, beyond confines world. So Lu´thien Tinu´viel alone Elf-kindred died indeed left world, lost loved. But lineage Elf-lords old descended among Men. There live still Lu´thien foremother, said line shall never fail. Elrond Rivendell Kin. For Beren Lu´thien born Dior Thingol’s heir; Elwing White Ea¨rendil wedded, sailed ship mists world seas heaven Silmaril upon brow. And Ea¨rendil came Kings Nu´menor, Westernesse.’ As Strider speaking watched strange eager face, dimly lit red glow wood-fire. His eyes shone, voice rich deep. Above black starry sky. Suddenly pale light appeared crown Weathertop behind him. The waxing moon climbing slowly hill overshadowed them, stars hill-top faded. The story ended. The hobbits moved stretched. ‘Look!’ said Merry. ‘The Moon rising: must getting late.’ The others looked up. Even so, saw top hill something small dark glimmer moonrise. It perhaps large stone jutting rock shown pale light. Sam Merry got walked away fire. Frodo Pippin remained seated silence. Strider watching moonlight hill intently. All seemed quiet still, Frodo felt cold dread creeping heart, Strider longer speaking. He huddled closer fire. At moment Sam came running back edge dell. ‘I don’t know is,’ said, ‘but I suddenly felt afraid. I durstn’t go outside dell money; I felt something creeping slope.’ ‘Did see anything?’ asked Frodo, springing feet. ‘No, sir. I saw nothing, I didn’t stop look.’ ‘I saw something,’ said Merry; ‘or I thought I – away westwards moonlight falling flats beyond shadow hill-tops, I thought two three black shapes. They seemed moving way.’ ‘Keep close fire, faces outward!’ cried Strider. ‘Get longer sticks ready hands!’ For breathless time sat there, silent alert, backs turned wood-fire, gazing shadows encircled them. Nothing happened. There sound movement night. Frodo stirred, feeling must break silence: longed shout aloud. ‘Hush!’ whispered Strider. ‘What’s that?’ gasped Pippin moment. Over lip little dell, side away hill, felt, rather saw, shadow rise, one shadow one. They strained eyes, shadows seemed grow. Soon could doubt: three four tall black figures standing slope, looking them. So black seemed like black holes deep shade behind them. Frodo thought heard faint hiss venomous breath felt thin piercing chill. Then shapes slowly advanced. Terror overcame Pippin Merry, threw flat ground. Sam shrank Frodo’s side. Frodo hardly less terrified companions; quaking bitter cold, terror swallowed sudden temptation put Ring. The desire laid hold him, could think nothing else. He forget Barrow, message Gandalf; something seemed compelling disregard warnings, longed yield. Not hope escape, anything, either good bad: simply felt must take Ring put finger. He could speak. He felt Sam looking him, knew master great trouble, could turn towards him. He shut eyes struggled while; resistance became unbearable, last slowly drew chain, slipped Ring forefinger left hand. Immediately, though everything else remained before, dim dark, shapes became terribly clear. He able see beneath black wrappings. There five tall figures: two standing lip dell, three advancing. In white faces burned keen merciless eyes; mantles long grey robes; upon grey hairs helms silver; haggard hands swords steel. Their eyes fell pierced him, rushed towards him. Desperate, drew sword, seemed flickered red, firebrand. Two figures halted. The third taller others: hair long gleaming helm crown. In one hand held long sword, knife; knife hand held glowed pale light. He sprang forward bore Frodo. At moment Frodo threw forward ground, heard crying aloud: O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! At time struck feet enemy. A shrill cry rang night; felt pain like dart poisoned ice pierce left shoulder. Even swooned caught, swirling mist, glimpse Strider leaping darkness flaming brand wood either hand. With last effort Frodo, dropping sword, slipped Ring finger closed right hand tight upon it. Chapter 12 FLIGHT TO THE FORD When Frodo came still clutching Ring desperately. He lying fire, piled high burning brightly. His three companions bending him. ‘What happened? Where pale king?’ asked wildly. They overjoyed hear speak answer while; understand question. At length gathered Sam seen nothing vague shadowy shapes coming towards them. Suddenly horror Sam found master vanished; moment black shadow rushed past him, fell. He heard Frodo’s voice, seemed come great distance, earth, crying strange words. They saw nothing more, stumbled body Frodo, lying dead, face downwards grass sword beneath him. Strider ordered pick lay near fire, disappeared. That good ago. Sam plainly beginning doubts Strider; talking returned, appearing suddenly shadows. They started, Sam drew sword stood Frodo; Strider knelt swiftly side. ‘I Black Rider, Sam,’ said gently, ‘nor league them. I trying discover something movements; I found nothing. I cannot think gone attack again. But feeling presence anywhere hand.’ When heard Frodo tell, became full concern, shook head sighed. Then ordered Pippin Merry heat much water could small kettles, bathe wound it. ‘Keep fire going well, keep Frodo warm!’ said. Then got walked away, called Sam him. ‘I think I understand things better now,’ said low voice. ‘There seem five enemy. Why here, I don’t know; I don’t think expected resisted. They drawn time being. But far, I fear. They come another night, cannot escape. They waiting, think purpose almost accomplished, Ring cannot fly much further. I fear, Sam, believe master deadly wound subdue will. We shall see!’ Sam choked tears. ‘Don’t despair!’ said Strider. ‘You must trust now. Your Frodo made sterner stuff I guessed, though Gandalf hinted might prove so. He slain, I think resist evil power wound longer enemies expect. I I help heal him. Guard well, I away!’ He hurried disappeared darkness. Frodo dozed, though pain wound slowly growing, deadly chill spreading shoulder arm side. His friends watched him, warming him, bathing wound. The night passed slowly wearily. Dawn growing sky, dell filling grey light, Strider last returned. ‘Look!’ cried; stooping lifted ground black cloak lain hidden darkness. A foot lower hem slash. ‘This stroke Frodo’s sword,’ said. ‘The hurt enemy, I fear; unharmed, blades perish pierce dreadful King. More deadly name Elbereth.’ ‘And deadly Frodo this!’ He stooped lifted long thin knife. There cold gleam it. As Strider raised saw near end edge notched point broken off. But even held growing light, gazed astonishment, blade seemed melt, vanished like smoke air, leaving hilt Strider’s hand. ‘Alas!’ cried. ‘It accursed knife gave wound. Few skill healing match evil weapons. But I I can.’ He sat ground, taking dagger-hilt laid knees, sang slow song strange tongue. Then setting aside, turned Frodo soft tone spoke words others could catch. From pouch belt drew long leaves plant. ‘These leaves,’ said, ‘I walked far find; plant grow bare hills; thickets away south Road I found dark scent leaves.’ He crushed leaf fingers, gave sweet pungent fragrance. ‘It fortunate I could find it, healing plant Men West brought Middle-earth. Athelas named it, grows sparsely near places dwelt camped old; known North, except wander Wild. It great virtues, wound healing powers may small.’ He threw leaves boiling water bathed Frodo’s shoulder. The fragrance steam refreshing, unhurt felt minds calmed cleared. The herb also power wound, Frodo felt pain also sense frozen cold lessen side; life return arm, could raise use hand. He bitterly regretted foolishness, reproached weakness will; perceived putting Ring obeyed desire commanding wish enemies. He wondered would remain maimed life, would manage continue journey. He felt weak stand. The others discussing question. They quickly decided leave Weathertop soon possible. ‘I think now,’ said Strider, ‘that enemy watching place days. If Gandalf ever came here, must forced ride away, return. In case great peril dark, since attack last night, hardly meet greater danger wherever go.’ As soon daylight full, hurried food packed. It impossible Frodo walk, divided greater part baggage among four them, put Frodo pony. In last days poor beast improved wonderfully; already seemed fatter stronger, begun show affection new masters, especially Sam. Bill Ferny’s treatment must hard journey wild seem much better former life. They started southerly direction. This would mean crossing Road, quickest way wooded country. And needed fuel; Strider said Frodo must kept warm, especially night, fire would protection all. It also plan shorten journey cutting across another great loop Road: east beyond Weathertop changed course took wide bend northwards. They made way slowly cautiously round south-western slopes hill, came little edge Road. There sign Riders. But even hurrying across heard far away two cries: cold voice calling cold voice answering. Trembling sprang forward, made thickets lay ahead. The land sloped away southwards, wild pathless; bushes stunted trees grew dense patches wide barren spaces between. The grass scanty, coarse, grey; leaves thickets faded falling. It cheerless land, journey slow gloomy. They spoke little trudged along. Frodo’s heart grieved watched walking beside heads down, backs bowed burdens. Even Strider seemed tired heavyhearted. Before first day’s march Frodo’s pain began grow again, speak long time. Four days passed, without ground scene changing much, except behind Weathertop slowly sank, distant mountains loomed little nearer. Yet since far cry seen heard sign enemy marked flight followed them. They dreaded dark hours, kept watch pairs night, expecting time see black shapes stalking grey night, dimly lit cloud-veiled moon; saw nothing, heard sound sigh withered leaves grass. Not feel sense present evil assailed attack dell. It seemed much hope Riders already lost trail again. Perhaps waiting make ambush narrow place? At end fifth day ground began rise slowly wide shallow valley descended. Strider turned course northeastwards, sixth day reached top long slow-climbing slope, saw far ahead huddle wooded hills. Away could see Road sweeping round feet hills; right grey river gleamed pale thin sunshine. In distance glimpsed yet another river stony valley half-veiled mist. ‘I afraid must go back Road while,’ said Strider. ‘We come River Hoarwell, Elves call Mitheithel. It flows Ettenmoors, troll-fells north Rivendell, joins Loudwater away South. Some call Greyflood that. It great water finds Sea. There way sources Ettenmoors, except Last Bridge Road crosses.’ ‘What river see far away there?’ asked Merry. ‘That Loudwater, Bruinen Rivendell,’ answered Strider. ‘The Road runs along edge hills many miles Bridge Ford Bruinen. But I yet thought shall cross water. One river time! We shall fortunate indeed find Last Bridge held us.’ Next day, early morning, came borders Road. Sam Strider went forward, found sign travellers riders. Here shadow hills rain. Strider judged fallen two days before, washed away footprints. No horseman passed since then, far could see. They hurried along speed could make, mile two saw Last Bridge ahead, bottom short steep slope. They dreaded see black figures waiting there, saw none. Strider made take cover thicket side Road, went forward explore. Before long came hurrying back. ‘I see sign enemy,’ said, ‘and I wonder much means. But I found something strange.’ He held hand, showed single pale-green jewel. ‘I found mud middle Bridge,’ said. ‘It beryl, elf-stone. Whether set there, let fall chance, I cannot say; brings hope me. I take sign may pass Bridge; beyond I dare keep Road, without clearer token.’ * * * At went again. They crossed Bridge safety, hearing sound water swirling three great arches. A mile came narrow ravine led away northwards steep lands left Road. Here Strider turned aside, soon lost sombre country dark trees winding among feet sullen hills. The hobbits glad leave cheerless lands perilous Road behind them; new country seemed threatening unfriendly. As went forward hills steadily rose. Here upon heights ridges caught glimpses ancient walls stone, ruins towers: ominous look. Frodo, walking, time gaze ahead think. He recalled Bilbo’s account journey threatening towers hills north Road, country near Trolls’ wood first serious adventure happened. Frodo guessed region, wondered chance would pass near spot. ‘Who lives land?’ asked. ‘And built towers? Is troll-country?’ ‘No!’ said Strider. ‘Trolls build. No one lives land. Men dwelt here, ages ago; none remain now. They became evil people, legends tell, fell shadow Angmar. But destroyed war brought North Kingdom end. But long ago hills forgotten them, though shadow still lies land.’ ‘Where learn tales, land empty forgetful?’ asked Peregrin. ‘The birds beasts tell tales sort.’ ‘The heirs Elendil forget things past,’ said Strider; ‘and many things I tell remembered Rivendell.’ ‘Have often Rivendell?’ said Frodo. ‘I have,’ said Strider. ‘I dwelt once, still I return I may. There heart is; fate sit peace, even fair house Elrond.’ The hills began shut in. The Road behind held way River Bruinen, hidden view. The travellers came long valley; narrow, deeply cloven, dark silent. Trees old twisted roots hung cliffs, piled behind mounting slopes pine-wood. The hobbits grew weary. They advanced slowly, pick way pathless country, encumbered fallen trees tumbled rocks. As long could avoided climbing Frodo’s sake, fact difficult find way narrow dales. They two days country weather turned wet. The wind began blow steadily West pour water distant seas dark heads hills fine drenching rain. By nightfall soaked, camp cheerless, could get fire burn. The next day hills rose still higher steeper them, forced turn away northwards course. Strider seemed getting anxious: nearly ten days Weathertop, stock provisions beginning run low. It went raining. That night camped stony shelf rock-wall behind them, shallow cave, mere scoop cliff. Frodo restless. The cold wet made wound painful ever, ache sense deadly chill took away sleep. He lay tossing turning listening fearfully stealthy night-noises: wind chinks rock, water dripping, crack, sudden rattling fall loosened stone. He felt black shapes advancing smother him; sat saw nothing back Strider sitting hunched up, smoking pipe, watching. He lay passed uneasy dream, walked grass garden Shire, seemed faint dim, less clear tall black shadows stood looking hedge. In morning woke find rain stopped. The clouds still thick, breaking, pale strips blue appeared them. The wind shifting again. They start early. Immediately cold comfortless breakfast Strider went alone, telling others remain shelter cliff, came back. He going climb up, could, get look lie land. When returned reassuring. ‘We come far north,’ said, ‘and must find way turn back southwards again. If keep going shall get Ettendales far north Rivendell. That troll-country, little known me. We could perhaps find way come round Rivendell north; would take long, I know way, food would last. So somehow must find Ford Bruinen.’ The rest day spent scrambling rocky ground. They found passage two hills led valley running south-east, direction wished take; towards end day found road barred ridge high land; dark edge sky broken many bare points like teeth blunted saw. They choice going back climbing it. They decided attempt climb, proved difficult. Before long Frodo obliged dismount struggle along foot. Even often despaired getting pony up, indeed finding path themselves, burdened were. The light nearly gone, exhausted, last reached top. They climbed narrow saddle two higher points, land fell steeply away again, short distance ahead. Frodo threw down, lay ground shivering. His left arm lifeless, side shoulder felt icy claws laid upon them. The trees rocks seemed shadowy dim. ‘We cannot go further,’ said Merry Strider. ‘I afraid much Frodo. I dreadfully anxious him. What do? Do think able cure Rivendell, ever get there?’ ‘We shall see,’ answered Strider. ‘There nothing I wilderness; chiefly wound I anxious press on. But I agree go tonight.’ ‘What matter master?’ asked Sam low voice, looking appealingly Strider. ‘His wound small, already closed. There’s nothing seen cold white mark shoulder.’ ‘Frodo touched weapons Enemy,’ said Strider, ‘and poison evil work beyond skill drive out. But give hope, Sam!’ Night cold high ridge. They lit small fire gnarled roots old pine, hung shallow pit: looked stone quarried there. They sat huddled together. The wind blew chill pass, heard tree-tops lower moaning sighing. Frodo lay half dream, imagining endless dark wings sweeping him, wings rode pursuers sought hollows hills. The morning dawned bright fair; air clean, light pale clear rain-washed sky. Their hearts encouraged, longed sun warm cold stiff limbs. As soon light, Strider took Merry went survey country height east pass. The sun risen shining brightly returned comforting news. They going less right direction. If went on, side ridge, would Mountains left. Some way ahead Strider caught glimpse Loudwater again, knew that, though hidden view, Road Ford far River lay side nearest them. ‘We must make Road again,’ said. ‘We cannot hope find path hills. Whatever danger may beset it, Road way Ford.’ As soon eaten set again. They climbed slowly southern side ridge; way much easier expected, slope far less steep side, long Frodo able ride again. Bill Ferny’s poor old pony developing unexpected talent picking path, sparing rider many jolts possible. The spirits party rose again. Even Frodo felt better morning light, every mist seemed obscure sight, passed hands eyes. Pippin little ahead others. Suddenly turned round called them. ‘There path here!’ cried. When came him, saw made mistake: clearly beginnings path, climbed many windings woods faded away hill-top behind. In places faint overgrown, choked fallen stones trees; one time seemed much used. It path made strong arms heavy feet. Here old trees cut broken down, large rocks cloven heaved aside make way. They followed track while, offered much easiest way down, went cautiously, anxiety increased came dark woods, path grew plainer broader. Suddenly coming belt fir-trees ran steeply slope, turned sharply left round corner rocky shoulder hill. When came corner looked round saw path ran level strip face low cliff overhung trees. In stony wall door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge. Outside door halted. There cave rock-chamber behind, gloom inside nothing could seen. Strider, Sam, Merry pushing strength managed open door little wider, Strider Merry went in. They go far, floor lay many old bones, nothing else seen near entrance except great empty jars broken pots. ‘Surely troll-hole, ever one!’ said Pippin. ‘Come out, two, let us get away. Now know made path – better get quick.’ ‘There need, I think,’ said Strider, coming out. ‘It certainly troll-hole, seems long forsaken. I don’t think need afraid. But let us go warily, shall see.’ The path went door, turning right across level space plunged thick wooded slope. Pippin, liking show Strider still afraid, went ahead Merry. Sam Strider came behind, one side Frodo’s pony, path broad enough four five hobbits walk abreast. But gone far Pippin came running back, followed Merry. They looked terrified. ‘There trolls!’ Pippin panted. ‘Down clearing woods far below. We got sight tree-trunks. They large!’ ‘We come look them,’ said Strider, picking stick. Frodo said nothing, Sam looked scared. The sun high, shone half-stripped branches trees, lit clearing bright patches light. They halted suddenly edge, peered tree-trunks, holding breath. There stood trolls: three large trolls. One stooping, two stood staring him. Strider walked forward unconcernedly. ‘Get up, old stone!’ said, broke stick upon stooping troll. Nothing happened. There gasp astonishment hobbits, even Frodo laughed. ‘Well!’ said. ‘We forgetting family history! These must three caught Gandalf, quarrelling right way cook thirteen dwarves one hobbit.’ ‘I idea anywhere near place!’ said Pippin. He knew story well. Bilbo Frodo told often; matter fact never half believed it. Even looked stone trolls suspicion, wondering magic might suddenly bring life again. ‘You forgetting family history, ever knew trolls,’ said Strider. ‘It broad daylight bright sun, yet come back trying scare tale live trolls waiting us glade! In case might noticed one old bird’s nest behind ear. That would unusual ornament live troll!’ They laughed. Frodo felt spirits reviving: reminder Bilbo’s first successful adventure heartening. The sun, too, warm comforting, mist eyes seemed lifting little. They rested time glade, took mid-day meal right shadow trolls’ large legs. ‘Won’t somebody give us bit song, sun high?’ said Merry, finished. ‘We haven’t song tale days.’ ‘Not since Weathertop,’ said Frodo. The others looked him. ‘Don’t worry me!’ added. ‘I feel much better, I don’t think I could sing. Perhaps Sam could dig something memory.’ ‘Come on, Sam!’ said Merry. ‘There’s stored head let about.’ ‘I don’t know that,’ said Sam. ‘But would suit? It ain’t I call proper poetry, understand me: bit nonsense. But old images brought mind.’ Standing up, hands behind back, school, began sing old tune. Troll sat alone seat stone, And munched mumbled bare old bone; For many year gnawed near, For meat hard come by. Done by! Gum by! In cave hills dwelt alone, And meat hard come by. Up came Tom big boots on. Said Troll: ‘Pray, yon? For looks like shin o’ nuncle Tim, As a-lyin’ graveyard. Caveyard! Paveyard! This many year Tim gone, And I thought lyin’ graveyard.’ ‘My lad,’ said Troll, ‘this bone I stole. But bones lie hole? Thy nuncle dead lump o’ lead, Afore I found shinbone. Tinbone! Thinbone! He spare share poor old troll, For don’t need shinbone.’ Said Tom: ‘I don’t see likes o’ thee Without axin’ leave go makin’ free With shank shin o’ father’s kin; So hand old bone over! Rover! Trover! Though dead be, belongs he; So hand old bone over!’ ‘For couple o’ pins,’ says Troll, grins, ‘I’ll eat thee too, gnaw thy shins. A bit o’ fresh meat go sweet! I’ll try teeth thee now. Hee now! See now! I’m tired o’ gnawing old bones skins; I’ve mind dine thee now.’ But thought dinner caught, He found hands hold naught. Before could mind, Tom slipped behind And gave boot larn him. Warn him! Darn him! A bump o’ boot seat, Tom thought, Would way larn him. But harder stone flesh bone Of troll sits hills alone. As well set boot mountain’s root, For seat troll don’t feel it. Peel it! Heal it! Old Troll laughed, heard Tom groan, And knew toes could feel it. Tom’s leg game, since home came, And bootless foot lasting lame; But Troll don’t care, he’s still With bone boned owner. Doner! Boner! Troll’s old seat still same, And bone boned owner! ‘Well, that’s warning us all!’ laughed Merry. ‘It well used stick, hand, Strider!’ ‘Where come that, Sam?’ asked Pippin. ‘I’ve never heard words before.’ Sam muttered something inaudible. ‘It’s head, course,’ said Frodo. ‘I learning lot Sam Gamgee journey. First conspirator, he’s jester. He’ll end becoming wizard – warrior!’ ‘I hope not,’ said Sam. ‘I don’t want neither!’ In afternoon went woods. They probably following track Gandalf, Bilbo, dwarves used many years before. After miles came top high bank Road. At point Road left Hoarwell far behind narrow valley, clung close feet hills, rolling winding eastward among woods heathercovered slopes towards Ford Mountains. Not far bank Strider pointed stone grass. On roughly cut much weathered could still seen dwarf-runes secret marks. ‘There!’ said Merry. ‘That must stone marked place trolls’ gold hidden. How much left Bilbo’s share, I wonder, Frodo?’ Frodo looked stone, wished Bilbo brought home treasure perilous, less easy part with. ‘None all,’ said. ‘Bilbo gave away. He told feel really his, came robbers.’ The Road lay quiet long shadows early evening. There sign travellers seen. As possible course take, climbed bank, turning left went fast could. Soon shoulder hills cut light fast westering sun. A cold wind flowed meet mountains ahead. They beginning look place Road, could camp night, heard sound brought sudden fear back hearts: noise hoofs behind them. They looked back, could see far many windings rollings Road. As quickly could scrambled beaten way deep heather bilberry brushwood slopes above, came small patch thick-growing hazels. As peered among bushes, could see Road, faint grey failing light, thirty feet them. The sound hoofs drew nearer. They going fast, light clippety-clippety-clip. Then faintly, blown away breeze, seemed catch dim ringing, small bells tinkling. ‘That sound like Black Rider’s horse!’ said Frodo, listening intently. The hobbits agreed hopefully not, remained full suspicion. They fear pursuit long sound behind seemed ominous unfriendly. But Strider leaning forward, stooped ground, hand ear, look joy face. The light faded, leaves bushes rustled softly. Clearer nearer bells jingled, clippety-clip came quick trotting feet. Suddenly view came white horse, gleaming shadows, running swiftly. In dusk headstall flickered flashed, studded gems like living stars. The rider’s cloak streamed behind him, hood thrown back; golden hair flowed shimmering wind speed. To Frodo appeared white light shining form raiment rider, thin veil. Strider sprang hiding dashed towards Road, leaping cry heather; even moved called, rider reined horse halted, looking towards thicket stood. When saw Strider, dismounted ran meet calling out: Ai na vedui Du´nadan! Mae govannen! His speech clear ringing voice left doubt hearts: rider Elven-folk. No others dwelt wide world voices fair hear. But seemed note haste fear call, saw speaking quickly urgently Strider. Soon Strider beckoned them, hobbits left bushes hurried Road. ‘This Glorfindel, dwells house Elrond,’ said Strider. ‘Hail, well met last!’ said Elf-lord Frodo. ‘I sent Rivendell look you. We feared danger upon road.’ ‘Then Gandalf reached Rivendell?’ cried Frodo joyfully. ‘No. He I departed; nine days ago,’ answered Glorfindel. ‘Elrond received news troubled him. Some kindred, journeying land beyond Baranduin,* learned things amiss, sent messages swiftly could. They said Nine abroad, astray bearing great burden without guidance, Gandalf returned. There even Rivendell ride openly Nine; were, Elrond sent north, west, south. It thought might turn far aside avoid pursuit, become lost Wilderness. ‘It lot take Road, I came Bridge Mitheithel, left token there, nigh seven days ago. Three servants Sauron upon Bridge, withdrew I pursued westward. I came also upon two others, turned away southward. Since I searched trail. Two days ago I found it, followed Bridge; today I marked descended hills again. But come! There time news. Since must risk peril Road go. There five behind us, find trail upon Road ride us like wind. And all. Where four may be, I know. I fear may find Ford already held us.’ While Glorfindel speaking shades evening deepened. Frodo felt great weariness come him. Ever since sun began sink mist eyes darkened, * The Brandywine River. felt shadow coming faces friends. Now pain assailed him, felt cold. He swayed, clutching Sam’s arm. ‘My master sick wounded,’ said Sam angrily. ‘He can’t go riding nightfall. He needs rest.’ Glorfindel caught Frodo sank ground, taking gently arms looked face grave anxiety. Briefly Strider told attack camp Weathertop, deadly knife. He drew hilt, kept, handed Elf. Glorfindel shuddered took it, looked intently it. ‘There evil things written hilt,’ said; ‘though maybe eyes cannot see them. Keep it, Aragorn, till reach house Elrond! But wary, handle little may! Alas! wounds weapon beyond skill heal. I I – I urge go without rest.’ He searched wound Frodo’s shoulder fingers, face grew graver, learned disquieted him. But Frodo felt chill lessen side arm; little warmth crept shoulder hand, pain grew easier. The dusk evening seemed grow lighter him, cloud withdrawn. He saw friends’ faces clearly again, measure new hope strength returned. ‘You shall ride horse,’ said Glorfindel. ‘I shorten stirrups saddle-skirts, must sit tight can. But need fear: horse let rider fall I command bear. His pace light smooth; danger presses near, bear away speed even black steeds enemy cannot rival.’ ‘No, not!’ said Frodo. ‘I shall ride him, I carried Rivendell anywhere else, leaving friends behind danger.’ Glorfindel smiled. ‘I doubt much,’ said, ‘if friends would danger them! The pursuit would follow leave us peace, I think. It you, Frodo, bear brings us peril.’ To Frodo answer, persuaded mount Glorfindel’s white horse. The pony laden instead great part others’ burdens, marched lighter, time made good speed; hobbits began find hard keep swift tireless feet Elf. On led them, mouth darkness, still deep clouded night. There neither star moon. Not grey dawn allow halt. Pippin, Merry, Sam time nearly asleep stumbling legs; even Strider seemed sag shoulders weary. Frodo sat upon horse dark dream. They cast heather yards road-side, fell asleep immediately. They seemed hardly closed eyes Glorfindel, set watch slept, awoke again. The sun climbed far morning, clouds mists night gone. ‘Drink this!’ said Glorfindel them, pouring turn little liquor silver-studded flask leather. It clear spring water taste, feel either cool warm mouth; strength vigour seemed flow limbs drank it. Eaten draught stale bread dried fruit (which left) seemed satisfy hunger better many good breakfast Shire done. They rested rather less five hours took Road again. Glorfindel still urged on, allowed two brief halts day’s march. In way covered almost twenty miles nightfall, came point Road bent right ran towards bottom valley, making straight Bruinen. So far sign sound pursuit hobbits could see hear; often Glorfindel would halt listen moment, lagged behind, look anxiety clouded face. Once twice spoke Strider elf-tongue. But however anxious guides might be, plain hobbits could go night. They stumbling along dizzy weariness, unable think anything feet legs. Frodo’s pain redoubled, day things faded shadows ghostly grey. He almost welcomed coming night, world seemed less pale empty. The hobbits still weary, set early next morning. There many miles yet go Ford, hobbled forward best pace could manage. ‘Our peril greatest ere reach river,’ said Glorfindel; ‘for heart warns pursuit swift behind us, danger may waiting Ford.’ The Road still running steadily downhill, places much grass either side, hobbits walked could, ease tired feet. In late afternoon came place Road went suddenly dark shadow tall pine-trees, plunged deep cutting steep moist walls red stone. Echoes ran along hurried forward; seemed sound many footfalls following own. All once, gate light, Road ran end tunnel open. There bottom sharp incline saw long flat mile, beyond Ford Rivendell. On side steep brown bank, threaded winding path; behind tall mountains climbed, shoulder shoulder, peak beyond peak, fading sky. There still echo following feet cutting behind them; rushing noise wind rising pouring branches pines. One moment Glorfindel turned listened, sprang forward loud cry. ‘Fly!’ called. ‘Fly! The enemy upon us!’ The white horse leaped forward. The hobbits ran slope. Glorfindel Strider followed rearguard. They half way across flat, suddenly noise horses galloping. Out gate trees left rode Black Rider. He reined horse in, halted, swaying saddle. Another followed him, another; two more. ‘Ride forward! Ride!’ cried Glorfindel Frodo. He obey once, strange reluctance seized him. Checking horse walk, turned looked back. The Riders seemed sit upon great steeds like threatening statues upon hill, dark solid, woods land receded mist. Suddenly knew heart silently commanding wait. Then fear hatred awoke him. His hand left bridle gripped hilt sword, red flash drew it. ‘Ride on! Ride on!’ cried Glorfindel, loud clear called horse elf-tongue: noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth! At white horse sprang away sped like wind along last lap Road. At moment black horses leaped hill pursuit, Riders came terrible cry, Frodo heard filling woods horror Eastfarthing far away. It answered; dismay Frodo friends trees rocks away left four Riders came flying. Two rode towards Frodo; two galloped madly towards Ford cut escape. They seemed run like wind grow swiftly larger darker, courses converged his. Frodo looked back moment shoulder. He could longer see friends. The Riders behind falling back: even great steeds match speed white elf-horse Glorfindel. He looked forward again, hope faded. There seemed chance reaching Ford cut others lain ambush. He could see clearly now: appeared cast aside hoods black cloaks, robed white grey. Swords naked pale hands; helms heads. Their cold eyes glittered, called fell voices. Fear filled Frodo’s mind. He thought longer sword. No cry came him. He shut eyes clung horse’s mane. The wind whistled ears, bells upon harness rang wild shrill. A breath deadly cold pierced like spear, last spurt, like flash white fire, elf-horse speeding wings, passed right face foremost Rider. Frodo heard splash water. It foamed feet. He felt quick heave surge horse left river struggled stony path. He climbing steep bank. He across Ford. But pursuers close behind. At top bank horse halted turned neighing fiercely. There Nine Riders water’s edge below, Frodo’s spirit quailed threat uplifted faces. He knew nothing would prevent crossing easily done; felt useless try escape long uncertain path Ford edge Rivendell, Riders crossed. In case felt commanded urgently halt. Hatred stirred him, longer strength refuse. Suddenly foremost Rider spurred horse forward. It checked water reared up. With great effort Frodo sat upright brandished sword. ‘Go back!’ cried. ‘Go back Land Mordor, follow more!’ His voice sounded thin shrill ears. The Riders halted, Frodo power Bombadil. His enemies laughed harsh chilling laughter. ‘Come back! Come back!’ called. ‘To Mordor take you!’ ‘Go back!’ whispered. ‘The Ring! The Ring!’ cried deadly voices; immediately leader urged horse forward water, followed closely two others. ‘By Elbereth Lu´thien Fair,’ said Frodo last effort, lifting sword, ‘you shall neither Ring me!’ Then leader, half across Ford, stood menacing stirrups, raised hand. Frodo stricken dumb. He felt tongue cleave mouth, heart labouring. His sword broke fell shaking hand. The elf-horse reared snorted. The foremost black horses almost set foot upon shore. At moment came roaring rushing: noise loud waters rolling many stones. Dimly Frodo saw river rise, along course came plumed cavalry waves. White flames seemed Frodo flicker crests, half fancied saw amid water white riders upon white horses frothing manes. The three Riders still midst Ford overwhelmed: disappeared, buried suddenly angry foam. Those behind drew back dismay. With last failing senses Frodo heard cries, seemed saw, beyond Riders hesitated shore, shining figure white light; behind ran small shadowy forms waving flames, flared red grey mist falling world. The black horses filled madness, leaping forward terror bore riders rushing flood. Their piercing cries drowned roaring river 281 carried away. Then Frodo felt falling, roaring confusion seemed rise engulf together enemies. He heard saw more. . BOOKTWO . Chapter 1 MANY MEETINGS Frodo woke found lying bed. At first thought slept late, long unpleasant dream still hovered edge memory. Or perhaps ill? But ceiling looked strange; flat, dark beams richly carved. He lay little longer looking patches sunlight wall, listening sound waterfall. ‘Where I, time?’ said aloud ceiling. ‘In house Elrond, ten o’clock morning,’ said voice. ‘It morning October twentyfourth, want know.’ ‘Gandalf!’criedFrodo,sittingup.Therewastheoldwizard, sitting chair open window. ‘Yes,’ said, ‘I here. And lucky here, too, absurd things done since left home.’ Frodo lay again. He felt comfortable peaceful argue, case think would get better argument. He fully awake now, memory journey returning: disastrous ‘short cut’ Old Forest; ‘accident’ The Prancing Pony; madness putting Ring dell Weathertop. While thinking things trying vain bring memory arriving Rivendell, long silence, broken soft puffs Gandalf’s pipe, blew white smoke-rings window. ‘Where’s Sam?’ Frodo asked length. ‘And others right?’ ‘Yes, safe sound,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Sam I sent get rest, half hour ago.’ ‘What happened Ford?’ said Frodo. ‘It seemed dim, somehow; still does.’ ‘Yes, would. You beginning fade,’ answered Gandalf. ‘The wound overcoming last. A hours would beyond aid. But strength you, dear hobbit! As showed Barrow. That touch go: perhaps dangerous moment all. I wish could held Weathertop.’ ‘You seem know great deal already,’ said Frodo. ‘I spoken others Barrow. At first horrible, afterwards things think about. How know it?’ ‘You talked long sleep, Frodo,’ said Gandalf gently, ‘and hard read mind memory. Do worry! Though I said ‘‘absurd’’ now, I mean it. I think well – others. It small feat come far, dangers, still bearing Ring.’ ‘We never done without Strider,’ said Frodo. ‘But needed you. I know without you.’ ‘I delayed,’ said Gandalf, ‘and nearly proved ruin. And yet I sure: may better so.’ ‘I wish would tell happened!’ ‘All good time! You supposed talk worry anything today, Elrond’s orders.’ ‘But talking would stop thinking wondering, quite tiring,’ said Frodo. ‘I wide awake now, I remember many things want explaining. Why delayed? You ought tell least.’ ‘You soon hear wish know,’ said Gandalf. ‘We shall Council, soon well enough. At moment I say I held captive.’ ‘You?’ cried Frodo. ‘Yes, I, Gandalf Grey,’ said wizard solemnly. ‘There many powers world, good evil. Some greater I am. Against I yet measured. But time coming. The Morgul-lord Black Riders come forth. War preparing!’ ‘Then knew Riders already – I met them?’ ‘Yes, I knew them. Indeed I spoke you; Black Riders Ringwraiths, Nine Servants Lord Rings. But I know arisen I fled once. I heard news I left June; story must wait. For moment saved disaster, Aragorn.’ ‘Yes,’ said Frodo, ‘it Strider saved us. Yet I afraid first. Sam never quite trusted him, I think, rate met Glorfindel.’ Gandalf smiled. ‘I heard Sam,’ said. ‘He doubts now.’ ‘I glad,’ said Frodo. ‘For I become fond Strider. Well, fond right word. I mean dear me; though strange, grim times. In fact, reminds often you. I didn’t know Big People like that. I thought, well, big, rather stupid: kind stupid like Butterbur; stupid wicked like Bill Ferny. But don’t know much Men Shire, except perhaps Bree-landers.’ ‘You don’t know much even them, think old Barliman stupid,’ said Gandalf. ‘He wise enough ground. He thinks less talks, slower; yet see brick wall time (as say Bree). But left Middle-earth like Aragorn son Arathorn. The race Kings Sea nearly end. It may War Ring last adventure.’ ‘Do really mean Strider one people old Kings?’ said Frodo wonder. ‘I thought vanished long ago. I thought Ranger.’ ‘Only Ranger!’ cried Gandalf. ‘My dear Frodo, Rangers are: last remnant North great people, Men West. They helped before; I shall need help days come; reached Rivendell, Ring yet rest.’ ‘I suppose not,’ said Frodo. ‘But far thought get here; I hope I shan’t go further. It pleasant rest. I month exile adventure, I find much I want.’ He fell silent shut eyes. After spoke again. ‘I reckoning,’ said, ‘and I can’t bring total October twenty-fourth. It ought twenty-first. We must reached Ford twentieth.’ ‘You talked reckoned good you,’ said Gandalf. ‘How side shoulder feel now?’ ‘I don’t know,’ Frodo answered. ‘They don’t feel all: improvement, but’ – made effort – ‘I move arm little. Yes, coming back life. It cold,’ added, touching left hand right. ‘Good!’ said Gandalf. ‘It mending fast. You soon sound again. Elrond cured you: tended days, ever since brought in.’ ‘Days?’ said Frodo. ‘Well, four nights three days, exact. The Elves brought Ford night twentieth, lost count. We terribly anxious, Sam hardly left side, day night, except run messages. Elrond master healing, weapons Enemy deadly. To tell truth, I little hope; I suspected fragment blade still closed wound. But could found last night. Then Elrond removed splinter. It deeply buried, working inwards.’ Frodo shuddered, remembering cruel knife notched blade vanished Strider’s hands. ‘Don’t alarmed!’ said Gandalf. ‘It gone now. It melted. And seems Hobbits fade reluctantly. I known strong warriors Big People would quickly overcome splinter, bore seventeen days.’ ‘What would done me?’ asked Frodo. ‘What Riders trying do?’ ‘They tried pierce heart Morgul-knife remains wound. If succeeded, would become like are, weaker command. You would become wraith dominion Dark Lord; would tormented trying keep Ring, greater torment possible robbed seeing hand.’ ‘Thank goodness I realize horrible danger!’ said Frodo faintly. ‘I mortally afraid, course; I known more, I dared even move. It marvel I escaped!’ ‘Yes, fortune fate helped you,’ said Gandalf, ‘not mention courage. For heart touched, shoulder pierced; resisted last. But terribly narrow shave, speak. You gravest peril wore Ring, half wraith-world yourself, might seized you. You could see them, could see you.’ ‘I know,’ said Frodo. ‘They terrible behold! But could see horses?’ ‘Because real horses; black robes real robes wear give shape nothingness dealings living.’ ‘Then black horses endure riders? All animals terrified draw near, even elf-horse Glorfindel. The dogs howl geese scream them.’ ‘Because horses born bred service Dark Lord Mordor. Not servants chattels wraiths! There orcs trolls, wargs werewolves; still many Men, warriors kings, walk alive Sun, yet sway. And number growing daily.’ ‘What Rivendell Elves? Is Rivendell safe?’ ‘Yes, present, else conquered. The Elves may fear Dark Lord, may fly him, never listen serve him. And Rivendell live still chief foes: Elven-wise, lords Eldar beyond furthest seas. They fear Ringwraiths, dwelt Blessed Realm live worlds, Seen Unseen great power.’ ‘I thought I saw white figure shone grow dim like others. Was Glorfindel then?’ ‘Yes, saw moment upon side: one mighty Firstborn. He Elf-lord house princes. Indeed power Rivendell withstand might Mordor, while: elsewhere powers still dwell. There power, too, another kind Shire. But places soon become islands siege, things go going. The Dark Lord putting forth strength. ‘Still,’ said, standing suddenly sticking chin, beard went stiff straight like bristling wire, ‘we must keep courage. You soon well, I talk death. You Rivendell, need worry anything present.’ ‘I haven’t courage keep up,’ said Frodo, ‘but I worried moment. Just give news friends, tell end affair Ford, I keep asking, I shall content present. After I shall another sleep, I think; I shan’t able close eyes finished story me.’ Gandalf moved chair bedside took good look Frodo. The colour come back face, eyes clear, fully awake aware. He smiling, seemed little wrong him. But wizard’s eye faint change, hint transparency, him, especially left hand lay outside upon coverlet. ‘Still must expected,’ said Gandalf himself. ‘He half yet, come end even Elrond foretell. Not evil, I think. He may become like glass filled clear light eyes see can.’ ‘You look splendid,’ said aloud. ‘I risk brief tale without consulting Elrond. But quite brief, mind you, must sleep again. This happened, far I gather. The Riders made straight you, soon fled. They need guidance horses longer: become visible them, already threshold world. And also Ring drew them. Your friends sprang aside, road, would ridden down. They knew nothing could save you, white horse could not. The Riders swift overtake, many oppose. On foot even Glorfindel Aragorn together could withstand Nine once. ‘When Ringwraiths swept by, friends ran behind. Close Ford small hollow beside road masked stunted trees. There hastily kindled fire; Glorfindel knew flood would come down, Riders tried cross, would deal left side river. The moment flood appeared, rushed out, followed Aragorn others flaming brands. Caught fire water, seeing Elf-lord revealed wrath, dismayed, horses stricken madness. Three carried away first assault flood; others hurled water horses overwhelmed.’ ‘And end Black Riders?’ asked Frodo. ‘No,’ said Gandalf. ‘Their horses must perished, without crippled. But Ringwraiths cannot easily destroyed. However, nothing fear present. Your friends crossed flood passed found lying face top bank, broken sword you. The horse standing guard beside you. You pale cold, feared dead, worse. Elrond’s folk met them, carrying slowly towards Rivendell.’ ‘Who made flood?’ asked Frodo. ‘Elrond commanded it,’ answered Gandalf. ‘The river valley power, rise anger great need bar Ford. As soon captain Ringwraiths rode water flood released. If I may say so, I added touches own: may noticed, waves took form great white horses shining white riders; many rolling grinding boulders. For moment I afraid let loose fierce wrath, flood would get hand wash away. There great vigour waters come snows Misty Mountains.’ ‘Yes, comes back now,’ said Frodo: ‘the tremendous roaring. I thought I drowning, friends enemies all. But safe!’ Gandalf looked quickly Frodo, shut eyes. ‘Yes, safe present. Soon feasting merrymaking celebrate victory Ford Bruinen, places honour.’ ‘Splendid!’ said Frodo. ‘It wonderful Elrond, Glorfindel great lords, mention Strider, take much trouble show much kindness.’ ‘Well, many reasons should,’ said Gandalf, smiling. ‘I one good reason. The Ring another: Ring-bearer. And heir Bilbo, Ring-finder.’ ‘Dear Bilbo!’ said Frodo sleepily. ‘I wonder is. I wish could hear it. It would made laugh. The cow jumped Moon! And poor old troll!’ With fell fast asleep. Frodo safe Last Homely House east Sea. That house was, Bilbo long ago reported, ‘a perfect house, whether like food sleep story-telling singing, sitting thinking best, pleasant mixture all’. Merely cure weariness, fear, sadness. As evening drew on, Frodo woke again, found longer felt need rest sleep, mind food drink, probably singing story-telling afterwards. He got bed discovered arm already nearly useful ever been. He found laid ready clean garments green cloth fitted excellently. Looking mirror startled see much thinner reflection remembered: looked remarkably like young nephew Bilbo used go tramping uncle Shire; eyes looked thoughtfully. ‘Yes, seen thing two since last peeped looking-glass,’ said reflection. ‘But merry meeting!’ He stretched arms whistled tune. At moment knock door, Sam came in. He ran Frodo took left hand, awkwardly shyly. He stroked gently blushed turned hastily away. ‘Hullo, Sam!’ said Frodo. ‘It’s warm!’ said Sam. ‘Meaning hand, Mr. Frodo. It felt cold long nights. But glory trumpets!’ cried, turning round shining eyes dancing floor. ‘It’s fine see again, sir! Gandalf asked come see ready come down, I thought joking.’ ‘I ready,’ said Frodo. ‘Let’s go look rest party!’ ‘I take them, sir,’ said Sam. ‘It’s big house this, peculiar. Always bit discover, knowing you’ll find round corner. And Elves, sir! Elves here, Elves there! Some like kings, terrible splendid; merry children. And music singing – I time heart much listening since got here. But I’m getting know ways place.’ ‘I know doing, Sam,’ said Frodo, taking arm. ‘But shall merry tonight, listen heart’s content. Come on, guide round corners!’ Sam led along several passages many steps high garden steep bank river. He found friends sitting porch side house looking east. Shadows fallen valley below, still light faces mountains far above. The air warm. The sound running falling water loud, evening filled faint scent trees flowers, summer still lingered Elrond’s gardens. ‘Hurray!’ cried Pippin, springing up. ‘Here noble cousin! Make way Frodo, Lord Ring!’ ‘Hush!’ said Gandalf shadows back porch. ‘Evil things come valley; name them. The Lord Ring Frodo, master Dark Tower Mordor, whose power stretching world. We sitting fortress. Outside getting dark.’ ‘Gandalf saying many cheerful things like that,’ said Pippin. ‘He thinks I need keeping order. But seems impossible, somehow, feel gloomy depressed place. I feel I could sing, I knew right song occasion.’ ‘I feel like singing myself,’ laughed Frodo. ‘Though moment I feel like eating drinking.’ ‘That soon cured,’ said Pippin. ‘You shown usual cunning getting time meal.’ ‘More meal! A feast!’ said Merry. ‘As soon Gandalf reported recovered, preparations began.’ He hardly finished speaking summoned hall ringing many bells. The hall Elrond’s house filled folk: Elves part, though guests sorts. Elrond, custom, sat great chair end long table upon dais; next one side sat Glorfindel, side sat Gandalf. Frodo looked wonder; never seen Elrond, many tales spoke; sat upon right hand left, Glorfindel, even Gandalf, thought knew well, revealed lords dignity power. Gandalf shorter stature two; long white hair, sweeping silver beard, broad shoulders, made look like wise king ancient legend. In aged face great snowy brows dark eyes set like coals could leap suddenly fire. Glorfindel tall straight; hair shining gold, face fair young fearless full joy; eyes bright keen, voice like music; brow sat wisdom, hand strength. The face Elrond ageless, neither old young, though written memory many things glad sorrowful. His hair dark shadows twilight, upon set circlet silver; eyes grey clear evening, light like light stars. Venerable seemed king crowned many winters, yet hale tried warrior fulness strength. He Lord Rivendell mighty among Elves Men. In middle table, woven cloths upon wall, chair canopy, sat lady fair look upon, like form womanhood Elrond Frodo guessed one close kindred. Young yet so. The braids dark hair touched frost; white arms clear face flawless smooth, light stars bright eyes, grey cloudless night; yet queenly looked, thought knowledge glance, one known many things years bring. Above brow head covered cap silver lace netted small gems, glittering white; soft grey raiment ornament save girdle leaves wrought silver. So Frodo saw mortals yet seen; Arwen, daughter Elrond, said likeness Lu´thien come earth again; called Undo´miel, Evenstar people. Long land mother’s kin, Lo´rien beyond mountains, lately returned Rivendell father’s house. But brothers, Elladan Elrohir, upon errantry; rode often far afield Rangers North, forgetting never mother’s torment dens orcs. Such loveliness living thing Frodo never seen imagined mind; surprised abashed find seat Elrond’s table among folk high fair. Though suitable chair, raised upon several cushions, felt small, rather place; feeling quickly passed. The feast merry food hunger could desire. It time looked even turned neighbours. He looked first friends. Sam begged allowed wait master, told time guest honour. Frodo could see now, sitting Pippin Merry upper end one side-tables close dais. He could see sign Strider. Next Frodo right sat dwarf important appearance, richly dressed. His beard, long forked, white, nearly white snow-white cloth garments. He wore silver belt, round neck hung chain silver diamonds. Frodo stopped eating look him. ‘Welcome well met!’ said dwarf, turning towards him. Then actually rose seat bowed. ‘Glo´in service,’ said, bowed still lower. ‘Frodo Baggins service family’s,’ said Frodo correctly, rising surprise scattering cushions. ‘Am I right guessing Glo´in, one twelve companions great Thorin Oakenshield?’ ‘Quite right,’ answered dwarf, gathering cushions courteously assisting Frodo back seat. ‘And I ask, I already told kinsman adopted heir friend Bilbo renowned. Allow congratulate recovery.’ ‘Thank much,’ said Frodo. ‘You strange adventures, I hear,’ said Glo´in. ‘I wonder greatly brings four hobbits long journey. Nothing like happened since Bilbo came us. But perhaps I inquire closely, since Elrond Gandalf seem disposed talk this?’ ‘I think speak it, least yet,’ said Frodo politely. He guessed even Elrond’s house matter Ring one casual talk; case wished forget troubles time. ‘But I equally curious,’ added, ‘to learn brings important dwarf far Lonely Mountain.’ Glo´in looked him. ‘If heard, I think speak yet either. Master Elrond summon us ere long, I believe, shall hear many things. But much else may told.’ Throughout rest meal talked together, Frodo listened spoke; news Shire, apart Ring, seemed small far-away unimportant, Glo´in much tell events northern regions Wilderland. Frodo learned Grimbeorn Old, son Beorn, lord many sturdy men, land Mountains Mirkwood neither orc wolf dared go. ‘Indeed,’ said Glo´in, ‘if Beornings, passage Dale Rivendell would long ago become impossible. They valiant men keep open High Pass Ford Carrock. But tolls high,’ added shake head; ‘and like Beorn old fond dwarves. Still, trusty, much days. Nowhere men friendly us Men Dale. They good folk, Bardings. The grandson Bard Bowman rules them, Brand son Bain son Bard. He strong king, realm reaches far south east Esgaroth.’ ‘And people?’ asked Frodo. ‘There much tell, good bad,’ said Glo´in; ‘yet mostly good: far fortunate, though escape shadow times. If really wish hear us, I tell tidings gladly. But stop weary! Dwarves’ tongues run speaking handiwork, say.’ And Glo´in embarked long account doings Dwarf-kingdom. He delighted found polite listener; Frodo showed sign weariness made attempt change subject, though actually soon got rather lost among strange names people places never heard before. He interested, however, hear Da´in still King Mountain, old (having passed two hundred fiftieth year), venerable, fabulously rich. Of ten companions survived Battle Five Armies seven still him: Dwalin, Glo´in, Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur. Bombur fat could move couch chair table, took six young dwarves lift him. ‘And become Balin Ori O´ in?’ asked Frodo. A shadow passed Glo´in’s face. ‘We know,’ answered. ‘It largely account Balin I come ask advice dwell Rivendell. But tonight let us speak merrier things!’ Glo´in began talk works people, telling Frodo great labours Dale Mountain. ‘We done well,’ said. ‘But metal-work cannot rival fathers, many whose secrets lost. We make good armour keen swords, cannot make mail blade match made dragon came. Only mining building surpassed old days. You see waterways Dale, Frodo, fountains, pools! You see stonepaved roads many colours! And halls cavernous streets earth arches carved like trees; terraces towers upon Mountain’s sides! Then would see idle.’ ‘I come see them, ever I can,’ said Frodo. ‘How surprised Bilbo would see changes Desolation Smaug!’ Glo´in looked Frodo smiled. ‘You fond Bilbo not?’ asked. ‘Yes,’ answered Frodo. ‘I would rather see towers palaces world.’ At length feast came end. Elrond Arwen rose went hall, company followed due order. The doors thrown open, went across wide passage doors, came hall. In tables, bright fire burning great hearth carven pillars upon either side. Frodo found walking Gandalf. ‘This Hall Fire,’ said wizard. ‘Here hear many songs tales – keep awake. But except high days usually stands empty quiet, people come wish peace, thought. There always fire here, year round, little light.’ As Elrond entered went towards seat prepared him, Elvish minstrels began make sweet music. Slowly hall filled, Frodo looked delight upon many fair faces gathered together; golden firelight played upon shimmered hair. Suddenly noticed, far end fire, small dark figure seated stool back propped pillar. Beside ground drinking-cup bread. Frodo wondered whether ill (if people ever ill Rivendell), unable come feast. His head seemed sunk sleep breast, fold dark cloak drawn face. Elrond went forward stood beside silent figure. ‘Awake, little master!’ said, smile. Then, turning Frodo, beckoned him. ‘Now last hour come wished for, Frodo,’ said. ‘Here friend long missed.’ The dark figure raised head uncovered face. ‘Bilbo!’ cried Frodo sudden recognition, sprang forward. ‘Hullo, Frodo lad!’ said Bilbo. ‘So got last. I hoped would manage it. Well, well! So feasting honour, I hear. I hope enjoyed yourself?’ ‘Why weren’t there?’ cried Frodo. ‘And haven’t I allowed see before?’ ‘Because asleep. I seen good deal you. I sat side Sam day. But feast, I don’t go things much now. And I something else do.’ ‘What doing?’ ‘Why, sitting thinking. I lot nowadays, best place in, rule. Wake up, indeed!’ said, cocking eye Elrond. There bright twinkle sign sleepiness Frodo could see. ‘Wake up! I asleep, Master Elrond. If want know, come feast soon, disturbed – middle making song. I stuck line two, thinking them; I don’t suppose I shall ever get right. There deal singing ideas driven clean head. I shall get friend Du´nadan help me. Where he?’ Elrond laughed. ‘He shall found,’ said. ‘Then two shall go corner finish task, hear judge end merrymaking.’ Messengers sent find Bilbo’s friend, though none knew was, present feast. In meanwhile Frodo Bilbo sat side side, Sam came quickly placed near them. They talked together soft voices, oblivious mirth music hall them. Bilbo much say himself. When left Hobbiton wandered aimlessly, along Road country either side; somehow steered time towards Rivendell. ‘I got without much adventure,’ said, ‘and rest I went dwarves Dale: last journey. I shan’t travel again. Old Balin gone away. Then I came back here, I been. I done that. I written book. And, course, I make songs. They sing occasionally: please me, I think; for, course, aren’t really good enough Rivendell. And I listen I think. Time doesn’t seem pass here: is. A remarkable place altogether. ‘I hear kinds news, Mountains, South, hardly anything Shire. I heard Ring, course. Gandalf often. Not told great deal, become closer ever last years. The Du´nadan told more. Fancy ring mine causing disturbance! It pity Gandalf find sooner. I could brought thing long ago without much trouble. I thought several times going back Hobbiton it; I getting old, would let me: Gandalf Elrond, I mean. They seemed think Enemy looking high low me, would make mincemeat me, caught tottering Wild. ‘And Gandalf said: ‘‘The Ring passed on, Bilbo. It would good others, tried meddle again.’’ Odd sort remark, like Gandalf. But said looking you, I let things be. I frightfully glad see safe sound.’ He paused looked Frodo doubtfully. ‘Have got here?’ asked whisper. ‘I can’t help feeling curious, know, I’ve heard. I much like peep again.’ ‘Yes, I’ve got it,’ answered Frodo, feeling strange reluctance. ‘It looks ever did.’ ‘Well, I like see moment,’ said Bilbo. When dressed, Frodo found slept Ring hung neck new chain, light strong. Slowly drew out. Bilbo put hand. But Frodo quickly drew back Ring. To distress amazement found longer looking Bilbo; shadow seemed fallen them, found eyeing little wrinkled creature hungry face bony groping hands. He felt desire strike him. The music singing round seemed falter, silence fell. Bilbo looked quickly Frodo’s face passed hand across eyes. ‘I understand now,’ said. ‘Put away! I sorry: sorry come burden; sorry everything. Don’t adventures ever end? I suppose not. Someone else always carry story. Well, can’t helped. I wonder it’s good trying finish book? But don’t let’s worry – let’s real News! Tell Shire!’ Frodo hid Ring away, shadow passed leaving hardly shred memory. The light music Rivendell again. Bilbo smiled laughed happily. Every item news Shire Frodo could tell – aided corrected Sam – greatest interest him, felling least tree pranks smallest child Hobbiton. They deep doings Four Farthings notice arrival man clad dark green cloth. For many minutes stood looking smile. Suddenly Bilbo looked up. ‘Ah, last, Du´nadan!’ cried. ‘Strider!’ said Frodo. ‘You seem lot names.’ ‘Well, Strider one I haven’t heard before, anyway,’ said Bilbo. ‘What call for?’ ‘They call Bree,’ said Strider laughing, ‘and I introduced him.’ ‘And call Du´nadan?’ asked Frodo. ‘The Du´nadan,’ said Bilbo. ‘He often called here. But I thought knew enough Elvish least know du´nadan: Man West, Nu´meno´rean. But time lessons!’ He turned Strider. ‘Where been, friend? Why weren’t feast? The Lady Arwen there.’ Strider looked Bilbo gravely. ‘I know,’ said. ‘But often I must put mirth aside. Elladan Elrohir returned Wild unlooked-for, tidings I wished hear once.’ ‘Well, dear fellow,’ said Bilbo, ‘now you’ve heard news, can’t spare moment? I want help something urgent. Elrond says song mine finished end evening, I stuck. Let’s go corner polish up!’ Strider smiled. ‘Come then!’ said. ‘Let hear it!’ Frodo left while, Sam fallen asleep. He alone felt rather forlorn, although folk Rivendell gathered. But near silent, intent upon music voices instruments, gave heed anything else. Frodo began listen. At first beauty melodies interwoven words elven-tongues, even though understood little, held spell, soon began attend them. Almost seemed words took shape, visions far lands bright things never yet imagined opened him; firelit hall became like golden mist seas foam sighed upon margins world. Then enchantment became dreamlike, felt endless river swelling gold silver flowing him, multitudinous pattern comprehended; became part throbbing air him, drenched drowned him. Swiftly sank shining weight deep realm sleep. There wandered long dream music turned running water, suddenly voice. It seemed voice Bilbo chanting verses. Faint first clearer ran words. Ea¨rendil mariner tarried Arvernien; built boat timber felled Nimbrethil journey in; sails wove silver fair, silver lanterns made, prow fashioned like swan, light upon banners laid. In panoply ancient kings, chaine´d rings armoured him; shining shield scored runes ward wounds harm him; bow made dragon-horn, arrows shorn ebony, silver habergeon, scabbard chalcedony; sword steel valiant, adamant helmet tall, eagle-plume upon crest, upon breast emerald. Beneath Moon star wandered far northern strands, bewildered enchanted ways beyond days mortal lands. From gnashing Narrow Ice shadow lies frozen hills, nether heats burning waste turned haste, roving still starless waters far astray last came Night Naught, passed, never sight saw shining shore light sought. The winds wrath came driving him, blindly foam fled west east, errandless, unheralded homeward sped. There flying Elwing came him, flame darkness lit; bright light diamond fire upon carcanet. The Silmaril bound crowned living light, dauntless burning brow turned prow; night Otherworld beyond Sea strong free storm arose, wind power Tarmenel; paths seldom mortal goes boat bore biting breath might death across grey long-forsaken seas distressed: east west passed away. Through Evernight back borne black roaring waves ran o’er leagues unlit foundered shores drowned Days began, heard strands pearl ends world music long, ever-foaming billows roll yellow gold jewels wan. He saw Mountain silent rise twilight lies upon knees Valinor, Eldamar beheld afar beyond seas. A wanderer escaped night white came last, Elvenhome green fair keen air, pale glass beneath Hill Ilmarin a-glimmer valley sheer lamplit towers Tirion mirrored Shadowmere. He tarried errantry, melodies taught him, sages old marvels told, harps gold brought him. They clothed elven-white, seven lights sent, Calacirian hidden land forlorn went. He came unto timeless halls shining fall countless years, endless reigns Elder King Ilmarin Mountain sheer; words unheard spoken folk Men Elven-kin, beyond world visions showed forbid dwell therein. A ship new built mithril elven-glass shining prow; shaven oar sail bore silver mast: Silmaril lantern light banner bright living flame gleam thereon Elbereth set, thither came wings immortal made him, laid undying doom, sail shoreless skies come behind Sun light Moon. From Evereven’s lofty hills softly silver fountains fall wings bore, wandering light, beyond mighty Mountain Wall. From World’s End turned away, yearned find afar home shadows journeying, burning island star high mists came, distant flame Sun, wonder ere waking dawn grey Norland waters run. And Middle-earth passed heard last weeping sore women elven-maids Elder Days, years yore. But mighty doom laid, till Moon fade, orbe´d star pass, tarry never Hither Shores mortals are; ever still herald errand never rest bear shining lamp afar, Flammifer Westernesse. The chanting ceased. Frodo opened eyes saw Bilbo seated stool circle listeners, smiling applauding. ‘Now better again,’ said Elf. Bilbo got bowed. ‘I flattered, Lindir,’ said. ‘But would tiring repeat all.’ ‘Not tiring you,’ Elves answered laughing. ‘You know never tired reciting verses. But really cannot answer question one hearing!’ ‘What!’ cried Bilbo. ‘You can’t tell parts mine, Du´nadan’s?’ ‘It easy us tell difference two mortals,’ said Elf. ‘Nonsense, Lindir,’ snorted Bilbo. ‘If can’t distinguish Man Hobbit, judgement poorer I imagined. They’re different peas apples.’ ‘Maybe. To sheep sheep doubt appear different,’ laughed Lindir. ‘Or shepherds. But Mortals study. We business.’ ‘I won’t argue you,’ said Bilbo. ‘I sleepy much music singing. I’ll leave guess, want to.’ He got came towards Frodo. ‘Well, that’s over,’ said low voice. ‘It went better I expected. I don’t often get asked second hearing. What think it?’ ‘I going try guess,’ said Frodo smiling. ‘You needn’t,’ said Bilbo. ‘As matter fact mine. Except Aragorn insisted putting green stone. He seemed think important. I don’t know why. Otherwise obviously thought whole thing rather head, said I cheek make verses Ea¨rendil house Elrond, affair. I suppose right.’ ‘I don’t know,’ said Frodo. ‘It seemed fit somehow, though I can’t explain. I half asleep began, seemed follow something I dreaming about. I didn’t understand really speaking near end.’ ‘It difficult keep awake here, get used it,’ said Bilbo. ‘Not hobbits would ever acquire quite Elvish appetite music poetry tales. They seem like much food, more. They going long time yet. What say slipping quiet talk?’ ‘Can we?’ said Frodo. ‘Of course. This merrymaking business. Come go like, long don’t make noise.’ They got withdrew quietly shadows, made doors. Sam left behind, fast asleep still smile face. In spite delight Bilbo’s company Frodo felt tug regret passed Hall Fire. Even stepped threshold single clear voice rose song. A Elbereth Gilthoniel, silivren penna mı´riel menel aglar elenath! Na-chaered palan-dı´riel galadhremmin ennorath, Fanuilos, le linnathon nef aear, sı´ nef aearon! Frodo halted moment, looking back. Elrond chair fire face like summer-light upon trees. Near sat Lady Arwen. To surprise Frodo saw Aragorn stood beside her; dark cloak thrown back, seemed clad elven-mail, star shone breast. They spoke together, suddenly seemed Frodo Arwen turned towards him, light eyes fell afar pierced heart. He stood still enchanted, sweet syllables Elvish song fell like clear jewels blended word melody. ‘It song Elbereth,’ said Bilbo. ‘They sing that, songs Blessed Realm, many times tonight. Come on!’ He led Frodo back little room. It opened gardens looked south across ravine Bruinen. There sat while, looking window bright stars steep-climbing woods, talking softly. They spoke small news Shire far away, dark shadows perils encompassed them, fair things seen world together, Elves, stars, trees, gentle fall bright year woods. At last came knock door. ‘Begging pardon,’ said Sam, putting head, ‘but I wondering would wanting anything.’ ‘And begging yours, Sam Gamgee,’ replied Bilbo. ‘I guess mean time master went bed.’ ‘Well, sir, Council early tomorrow, I hear, got today first time.’ ‘Quite right, Sam,’ laughed Bilbo. ‘You trot tell Gandalf gone bed. Good night, Frodo! Bless me, good see again! There folk like hobbits real good talk. I getting old, I began wonder I live see chapters story. Good night! I’ll take walk, I think, look stars Elbereth garden. Sleep well!’ Chapter 2 THE COUNCIL OF ELROND Next day Frodo woke early, feeling refreshed well. He walked along terraces loud-flowing Bruinen watched pale, cool sun rise far mountains, shine down, slanting thin silver mist; dew upon yellow leaves glimmering, woven nets gossamer twinkled every bush. Sam walked beside him, saying nothing, sniffing air, looking every wonder eyes great heights East. The snow white upon peaks. On seat cut stone beside turn path came upon Gandalf Bilbo deep talk. ‘Hullo! Good morning!’ said Bilbo. ‘Feel ready great council?’ ‘I feel ready anything,’ answered Frodo. ‘But I like go walking today explore valley. I like get pine-woods there.’ He pointed away far side Rivendell north. ‘You mayhave chance later,’said Gandalf. ‘Butwe cannot make plans yet. There much hear decide today.’ Suddenly talking single clear bell rang out. ‘That warning bell Council Elrond,’ cried Gandalf. ‘Come along now! Both Bilbo wanted.’ Frodo Bilbo followed wizard quickly along winding path back house; behind them, uninvited moment forgotten, trotted Sam. Gandalf led porch Frodo found friends evening before. The light clear autumn morning glowing valley. The noise bubbling waters came foaming river-bed. Birds singing, wholesome peace lay land. To Frodo dangerous flight, rumours darkness growing world outside, already seemed memories troubled dream; faces turned meet entered grave. Elrond there, several others seated silence him. Frodo saw Glorfindel Glo´in; corner alone Strider sitting, clad old travel-worn clothes again. Elrond drew Frodo seat side, presented company, saying: ‘Here, friends, hobbit, Frodo son Drogo. Few ever come hither greater peril errand urgent.’ He pointed named Frodo met before. There younger dwarf Glo´in’s side: son Gimli. Beside Glorfindel several counsellors Elrond’s household, Erestor chief; Galdor, Elf Grey Havens come errand Cı´rdan Shipwright. There also strange Elf clad green brown, Legolas, messenger father, Thranduil, King Elves Northern Mirkwood. And seated little apart tall man fair noble face, dark-haired grey-eyed, proud stern glance. He cloaked booted journey horseback; indeed though garments rich, cloak lined fur, stained long travel. He collar silver single white stone set; locks shorn shoulders. On baldric wore great horn tipped silver laid upon knees. He gazed Frodo Bilbo sudden wonder. ‘Here,’ said Elrond, turning Gandalf, ‘is Boromir, man South. He arrived grey morning, seeks counsel. I bidden present, questions answered.’ Not spoken debated Council need told. Much said events world outside, especially South, wide lands east Mountains. Of things Frodo already heard many rumours; tale Glo´in new him, dwarf spoke listened attentively. It appeared amid splendour works hand hearts Dwarves Lonely Mountain troubled. ‘It many years ago,’ said Glo´in, ‘that shadow disquiet fell upon people. Whence came first perceive. Words began whispered secret: said hemmed narrow place, greater wealth splendour would found wider world. Some spoke Moria: mighty works fathers called tongue Khazad-duˆm; declared last power numbers return.’ Glo´in sighed. ‘Moria! Moria! Wonder Northern world! Too deep delved there, woke nameless fear. Long vast mansions lain empty since children Durin fled. But spoke longing, yet dread; dwarf dared pass doors Khazad-duˆm many lives kings, save Thro´r only, perished. At last, however, Balin listened whispers, resolved go; though Da´in give leave willingly, took Ori O´ many folk, went away south. ‘That nigh thirty years ago. For news seemed good: messages reported Moria entered great work begun there. Then silence, word ever come Moria since. ‘Then year ago messenger came Da´in, Moria – Mordor: horseman night, called Da´in gate. The Lord Sauron Great, said, wished friendship. Rings would give it, gave old. And asked urgently concerning hobbits, kind were, dwelt. ‘‘For Sauron knows,’’ said he, ‘‘that one known time.’’ ‘At greatly troubled, gave answer. And fell voice lowered, would sweetened could. ‘‘As small token friendship Sauron asks this,’’ said: ‘‘that find thief,’’ word, ‘‘and get him, willing no, little ring, least rings, stole. It trifle Sauron fancies, earnest good will. Find it, three rings Dwarf-sires possessed old shall returned you, realm Moria shall ever. Find news thief, whether still lives where, shall great reward lasting friendship Lord. Refuse, things seem well. Do refuse?’’ ‘At breath came like hiss snakes, stood shuddered, Da´in said: ‘‘I say neither yea nay. I must consider message means fair cloak.’’ ‘‘‘Consider well, long,’’ said he. ‘‘‘The time thought spend,’’ answered Da´in. ‘‘‘For present,’’ said he, rode darkness. ‘Heavy hearts chieftains since night. We needed fell voice messenger warn us words held menace deceit; knew already power re-entered Mordor changed, ever betrayed us old. Twice messenger returned, gone unanswered. The third last time, says, soon come, ending year. ‘And I sent last Da´in warn Bilbo sought Enemy, learn, may be, desires ring, least rings. Also crave advice Elrond. For Shadow grows draws nearer. We discover messengers come also King Brand Dale, afraid. We fear may yield. Already war gathering eastern borders. If make answer, Enemy may move Men rule assail King Brand, Da´in also.’ ‘You done well come,’ said Elrond. ‘You hear today need order understand purposes Enemy. There naught do, resist, hope without it. But stand alone. You learn trouble part trouble western world. The Ring! What shall Ring, least rings, trifle Sauron fancies? That doom must deem. ‘That purpose called hither. Called, I say, though I called me, strangers distant lands. You come met, nick time, chance may seem. Yet so. Believe rather ordered we, sit here, none others, must find counsel peril world. ‘Now, therefore, things shall openly spoken hidden day. And first, may understand peril, Tale Ring shall told beginning even present. And I begin tale, though others shall end it.’ Then listened Elrond clear voice spoke Sauron Rings Power, forging Second Age world long ago. A part tale known there, full tale none, many eyes turned Elrond fear wonder told Elven-smiths Eregion friendship Moria, eagerness knowledge, Sauron ensnared them. For time yet evil behold, received aid grew mighty craft, whereas learned secrets, betrayed them, forged secretly Mountain Fire One Ring master. But Celebrimbor aware him, hid Three made; war, land laid waste, gate Moria shut. Then years followed traced Ring; since history elsewhere recounted, even Elrond set books lore, recalled. For long tale, full deeds great terrible, briefly though Elrond spoke, sun rode sky, morning passing ere ceased. Of Nu´menor spoke, glory fall, return Kings Men Middle-earth deeps Sea, borne upon wings storm. Then Elendil Tall mighty sons, Isildur Ana´rion, became great lords; North-realm made Arnor, Southrealm Gondor mouths Anduin. But Sauron Mordor assailed them, made Last Alliance Elves Men, hosts Gil-galad Elendil mustered Arnor. Thereupon Elrond paused sighed. ‘I remember well splendour banners,’ said. ‘It recalled glory Elder Days hosts Beleriand, many great princes captains assembled. And yet many, fair, Thangorodrim broken, Elves deemed evil ended ever, so.’ ‘You remember?’ said Frodo, speaking thought aloud astonishment. ‘But I thought,’ stammered Elrond turned towards him, ‘I thought fall Gil-galad long age ago.’ ‘So indeed,’ answered Elrond gravely. ‘But memory reaches back even Elder Days. Ea¨rendil sire, born Gondolin fall; mother Elwing, daughter Dior, son Lu´thien Doriath. I seen three ages West world, many defeats, many fruitless victories. ‘I herald Gil-galad marched host. I Battle Dagorlad Black Gate Mordor, mastery: Spear Gil-galad Sword Elendil, Aeglos Narsil, none could withstand. I beheld last combat slopes Orodruin, Gil-galad died, Elendil fell, Narsil broke beneath him; Sauron overthrown, Isildur cut Ring hand hilt-shard father’s sword, took own.’ At stranger, Boromir, broke in. ‘So became Ring!’ cried. ‘If ever tale told South, long forgotten. I heard Great Ring name; believed perished world ruin first realm. Isildur took it! That tidings indeed.’ ‘Alas! yes,’ said Elrond. ‘Isildur took it, been. It cast Orodruin’s fire nigh hand made. But marked Isildur did. He alone stood father last mortal contest; Gil-galad Cı´rdan stood, I. But Isildur would listen counsel. ‘‘‘This I weregild father, brother,’’ said; therefore whether would no, took treasure it. But soon betrayed death; named North Isildur’s Bane. Yet death maybe better else might befallen him. ‘Only North tidings come, few. Small wonder heard them, Boromir. From ruin Gladden Fields, Isildur perished, three men came ever back mountains long wandering. One Ohtar, esquire Isildur, bore shards sword Elendil; brought Valandil, heir Isildur, child remained Rivendell. But Narsil broken light extinguished, yet forged again. ‘Fruitless I call victory Last Alliance? Not wholly so, yet achieve end. Sauron diminished, destroyed. His Ring lost unmade. The Dark Tower broken, foundations removed; made power Ring, remains endure. Many Elves many mighty Men, many friends, perished war. Ana´rion slain, Isildur slain; Gil-galad Elendil more. Never shall league Elves Men; Men multiply Firstborn decrease, two kindreds estranged. And ever since day race Nu´menor decayed, span years lessened. ‘In North war slaughter Gladden Fields Men Westernesse diminished, city Annu´minas beside Lake Evendim fell ruin; heirs Valandil removed dwelt Fornost high North Downs, desolate. Men call Deadmen’s Dike, fear tread there. For folk Arnor dwindled, foes devoured them, lordship passed, leaving green mounds grassy hills. ‘In South realm Gondor long endured; splendour grew, recalling somewhat might Nu´menor, ere fell. High towers people built, strong places, havens many ships; winged crown Kings Men held awe folk many tongues. Their chief city Osgiliath, Citadel Stars, midst River flowed. And Minas Ithil built, Tower Rising Moon, eastward upon shoulder Mountains Shadow; westward feet White Mountains Minas Anor made, Tower Setting Sun. There courts King grew white tree, seed tree Isildur brought deep waters, seed tree came Eresse¨a, Uttermost West Day days world young. ‘But wearing swift years Middle-earth line Meneldil son Ana´rion failed, Tree withered, blood Nu´meno´reans became mingled lesser men. Then watch upon walls Mordor slept, dark things crept back Gorgoroth. And time evil things came forth, took Minas Ithil abode it, made place dread; called Minas Morgul, Tower Sorcery. Then Minas Anor named anew Minas Tirith, Tower Guard; two cities ever war, Osgiliath lay deserted ruins shadows walked. ‘So many lives men. But Lords Minas Tirith still fight on, defying enemies, keeping passage River Argonath Sea. And part tale I shall tell drawn close. For days Isildur Ruling Ring passed knowledge, Three released dominion. But latter day peril more, sorrow One found. Others shall speak finding, I played small part.’ He ceased, Boromir stood up, tall proud, them. ‘Give leave, Master Elrond,’ said he, ‘first say Gondor, verily land Gondor I come. And would well know passes there. For few, I deem, know deeds, therefore guess little peril, fail last. ‘Believe land Gondor blood Nu´menor spent, pride dignity forgotten. By valour wild folk East still restrained, terror Morgul kept bay; thus alone peace freedom maintained lands behind us, bulwark West. But passages River won, then? ‘Yet hour, maybe, far away. The Nameless Enemy arisen again. Smoke rises Orodruin call Mount Doom. The power Black Land grows hard beset. When Enemy returned folk driven Ithilien, fair domain east River, though kept foothold strength arms. But year, days June, sudden war came upon us Mordor, swept away. We outnumbered, Mordor allied Easterlings cruel Haradrim; numbers defeated. A power felt before. ‘Some said could seen, like great black horseman, dark shadow moon. Wherever came madness filled foes, fear fell boldest, horse man gave way fled. Only remnant eastern force came back, destroying last bridge still stood amid ruins Osgiliath. ‘I company held bridge, cast behind us. Four saved swimming: brother two others. But still fight on, holding west shores Anduin; shelter behind us give us praise, ever hear name: much praise little help. Only Rohan men ride us call. ‘In evil hour I come errand many dangerous leagues Elrond: hundred ten days I journeyed alone. But I seek allies war. The might Elrond wisdom weapons, said. I come ask counsel unravelling hard words. For eve sudden assault dream came brother troubled sleep; afterwards like dream came oft again, me. ‘In dream I thought eastern sky grew dark growing thunder, West pale light lingered, I heard voice, remote clear, crying: Seek Sword broken: In Imladris dwells; There shall counsels taken Stronger Morgul-spells. There shall shown token That Doom near hand, For Isildur’s Bane shall waken, And Halfling forth shall stand. Of words could understand little, spoke father, Denethor, Lord Minas Tirith, wise lore Gondor. This would say, Imladris old name among Elves far northern dale, Elrond Halfelven dwelt, greatest lore-masters. Therefore brother, seeing desperate need, eager heed dream seek Imladris; since way full doubt danger, I took journey upon myself. Loth father give leave, long I wandered roads forgotten, seeking house Elrond, many heard, knew lay.’ ‘And house Elrond shall made clear you,’ said Aragorn, standing up. He cast sword upon table stood Elrond, blade two pieces. ‘Here Sword Broken!’ said. ‘And you, Minas Tirith?’ asked Boromir, looking wonder lean face Ranger weather-stained cloak. ‘He Aragorn son Arathorn,’ said Elrond; ‘and descended many fathers Isildur Elendil’s son Minas Ithil. He Chief Du´nedain North, left folk.’ ‘Then belongs you, all!’ cried Frodo amazement, springing feet, expected Ring demanded once. ‘It belong either us,’ said Aragorn; ‘but ordained hold while.’ ‘Bring Ring, Frodo!’ said Gandalf solemnly. ‘The time come. Hold up, Boromir understand remainder riddle.’ There hush, turned eyes Frodo. He shaken sudden shame fear; felt great reluctance reveal Ring, loathing touch. He wished far away. The Ring gleamed flickered held trembling hand. ‘Behold Isildur’s Bane!’ said Elrond. Boromir’s eyes glinted gazed golden thing. ‘The Halfling!’ muttered. ‘Is doom Minas Tirith come last? But seek broken sword?’ ‘The words doom Minas Tirith,’ said Aragorn. ‘But doom great deeds indeed hand. For Sword Broken Sword Elendil broke beneath fell. It treasured heirs heirlooms lost; spoken old among us made Ring, Isildur’s Bane, found. Now seen sword sought, would ask? Do wish House Elendil return Land Gondor?’ ‘I sent beg boon, seek meaning riddle,’ answered Boromir proudly. ‘Yet hard pressed, Sword Elendil would help beyond hope – thing could indeed return shadows past.’ He looked Aragorn, doubt eyes. Frodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently side. Evidently annoyed friend’s behalf. Standing suddenly burst out: All gold glitter, Not wander lost; The old strong wither, Deep roots reached frost. From ashes fire shall woken, A light shadows shall spring; Renewed shall blade broken: The crownless shall king. ‘Not good perhaps, point – need beyond word Elrond. If worth journey hundred ten days hear, best listen it.’ He sat snort. ‘I made myself,’ whispered Frodo, ‘for Du´nadan, long time ago first told himself. I almost wish adventures over, I could go day comes.’ Aragorn smiled him; turned Boromir again. ‘For part I forgive doubt,’ said. ‘Little I resemble figures Elendil Isildur stand carven majesty halls Denethor. I heir Isildur, Isildur himself. I hard life long; leagues lie Gondor small part count journeys. I crossed many mountains many rivers, trodden many plains, even far countries Rhuˆn Harad stars strange. ‘But home, I have, North. For heirs Valandil ever dwelt long line unbroken father unto son many generations. Our days darkened, dwindled; ever Sword passed new keeper. And I say you, Boromir, ere I end. Lonely men we, Rangers wild, hunters – hunters ever servants Enemy; found many places, Mordor only. ‘If Gondor, Boromir, stalwart tower, played another part. Many evil things strong walls bright swords stay. You know little lands beyond bounds. Peace freedom, say? The North would known little us. Fear would destroyed them. But dark things come houseless hills, creep sunless woods, fly us. What roads would dare tread, safety would quiet lands, homes simple men night, Du´nedain asleep, gone grave? ‘And yet less thanks you. Travellers scowl us, countrymen give us scornful names. ‘‘Strider’’ I one fat man lives within day’s march foes would freeze heart, lay little town ruin, guarded ceaselessly. Yet would otherwise. If simple folk free care fear, simple be, must secret keep so. That task kindred, years lengthened grass grown. ‘But world changing again. A new hour comes. Isildur’s Bane found. Battle hand. The Sword shall reforged. I come Minas Tirith.’ ‘Isildur’s Bane found, say,’ said Boromir. ‘I seen bright ring Halfling’s hand; Isildur perished ere age world began, say. How Wise know ring his? And passed years, brought hither strange messenger?’ ‘That shall told,’ said Elrond. ‘But yet, I beg, Master!’ cried Bilbo. ‘Already Sun climbing noon, I feel need something strengthen me.’ ‘I named you,’ said Elrond smiling. ‘But I now. Come! Tell us tale. And yet cast story verse, may tell plain words. The briefer, sooner shall refreshed.’ ‘Very well,’ said Bilbo. ‘I bid. But I tell true story, heard tell otherwise’ – looked sidelong Glo´in – ‘I ask forget forgive me. I wished claim treasure days, rid name thief put me. But perhaps I understand things little better now. Anyway, happened.’ To Bilbo’s tale wholly new, listened amazement old hobbit, actually displeased, recounted adventure Gollum, full length. He omit single riddle. He would given also account party disappearance Shire, allowed; Elrond raised hand. ‘Well told, friend,’ said, ‘but enough time. For moment suffices know Ring passed Frodo, heir. Let speak!’ Then, less willingly Bilbo, Frodo told dealings Ring day passed keeping. Every step journey Hobbiton Ford Bruinen questioned considered, everything could recall concerning Black Riders examined. At last sat again. ‘Not bad,’ Bilbo said him. ‘You would made good story it, hadn’t kept interrupting. I tried make notes, shall go together time, I write up. There whole chapters stuff ever got here!’ ‘Yes, made quite long tale,’ answered Frodo. ‘But story still seem complete me. I still want know good deal, especially Gandalf.’ Galdor Havens, sat nearby, overheard him. ‘You speak also,’ cried, turning Elrond said: ‘The Wise may good reason believe halfling’s trove indeed Great Ring long debate, unlikely though may seem know less. But may hear proofs? And I would ask also. What Saruman? He learned lore Rings, yet among us. What counsel – knows things heard?’ ‘The questions ask, Galdor, bound together,’ said Elrond. ‘I overlooked them, shall answered. But things part Gandalf make clear; I call upon last, place honour, matter chief.’ ‘Some, Galdor,’ said Gandalf, ‘would think tidings Glo´in, pursuit Frodo, proof enough halfling’s trove thing great worth Enemy. Yet ring. What then? The Nine Nazguˆl keep. The Seven taken destroyed.’ At Glo´in stirred, speak. ‘The Three know of. What one desires much? ‘There indeed wide waste time River Mountain, loss finding. But gap knowledge Wise filled last. Yet slowly. For Enemy close behind, closer even I feared. And well year, summer, seems, learn full truth. ‘Some remember many years ago I dared pass doors Necromancer Dol Guldur, secretly explored ways, found thus fears true: none Sauron, Enemy old, length taking shape power again. Some, too, remember also Saruman dissuaded us open deeds him, long watched only. Yet last, shadow grew, Saruman yielded, Council put forth strength drove evil Mirkwood – year finding Ring: strange chance, chance was. ‘But late, Elrond foresaw. Sauron also watched us, long prepared stroke, governing Mordor afar Minas Morgul, Nine servants dwelt, ready. Then gave way us, feigned flee, soon came Dark Tower openly declared himself. Then last time Council met; learned seeking ever eagerly One. We feared news knew nothing of. But Saruman said nay, repeated said us before: One would never found Middle-earth. ‘‘‘At worst,’’ said he, ‘‘our Enemy knows not, still lost. But lost may yet found, thinks. Fear not! His hope cheat him. Have I earnestly studied matter? Into Anduin Great fell; long ago, Sauron slept, rolled River Sea. There let lie End.’’’ Gandalf fell silent, gazing eastward porch far peaks Misty Mountains, whose great roots peril world long lain hidden. He sighed. ‘There I fault,’ said. ‘I lulled words Saruman Wise; I sought truth sooner, peril would less.’ ‘We fault,’ said Elrond, ‘and vigilance Darkness, maybe, would already upon us. But say on!’ ‘From first heart misgave me, reason I knew,’ said Gandalf, ‘and I desired know thing came Gollum, long possessed it. So I set watch him, guessing would ere long come forth darkness seek treasure. He came, escaped found. And alas! I let matter rest, watching waiting only, often done. ‘Time passed many cares, doubts awakened sudden fear. Whence came hobbit’s ring? What, fear true, done it? Those things I must decide. But I spoke yet dread none, knowing peril untimely whisper, went astray. In long wars Dark Tower treason ever greatest foe. ‘That seventeen years ago. Soon I became aware spies many sorts, even beasts birds, gathered round Shire, fear grew. I called help Du´nedain, watch doubled; I opened heart Aragorn, heir Isildur.’ ‘And I,’ said Aragorn, ‘counselled hunt Gollum, late though may seem. And since seemed fit Isildur’s heir labour repair Isildur’s fault, I went Gandalf long hopeless search.’ Then Gandalf told explored whole length Wilderland, even Mountains Shadow fences Mordor. ‘There rumour him, guess dwelt long dark hills; never found him, last I despaired. And despair I thought test might make finding Gollum unneeded. The ring might tell One. The memory words Council came back me: words Saruman, half-heeded time. I heard clearly heart. ‘‘‘The Nine, Seven, Three,’’ said, ‘‘had proper gem. Not One. It round unadorned, one lesser rings; maker set marks upon skilled, maybe, could still see read.’’ ‘What marks said. Who would know? The maker. And Saruman? But great though lore may be, must source. What hand save Sauron’s ever held thing, ere lost? The hand Isildur alone. ‘With thought, I forsook chase, passed swiftly Gondor. In former days members order well received there, Saruman all. Often long guest Lords City. Less welcome Lord Denethor show old, grudgingly permitted search among hoarded scrolls books. ‘‘‘If indeed look only, say, records ancient days, beginnings City, read on!’’ said. ‘‘For less dark come, care. But unless skill even Saruman, studied long, find naught well known me, master lore City.’’ ‘So said Denethor. And yet lie hoards many records even lore-masters read, scripts tongues become dark later men. And Boromir, lies Minas Tirith still, unread, I guess, save Saruman since kings failed, scroll Isildur made himself. For Isildur march away straight war Mordor, told tale.’ ‘Some North, maybe,’ Boromir broke in. ‘All know Gondor went first Minas Anor dwelt nephew Meneldil, instructing him, committed rule South Kingdom. In time planted last sapling White Tree memory brother.’ ‘But time also made scroll,’ said Gandalf; ‘and remembered Gondor, would seem. For scroll concerns Ring, thus wrote Isildur therein: The Great Ring shall go heirloom North Kingdom; records shall left Gondor, also dwell heirs Elendil, lest time come memory great matters shall grow dim. ‘And words Isildur described Ring, found it. It hot I first took it, hot glede, hand scorched, I doubt ever I shall free pain it. Yet even I write cooled, seemeth shrink, though loseth neither beauty shape. Already writing upon it, first clear red flame, fadeth barely read. It fashioned elven-script Eregion, letters Mordor subtle work; language unknown me. I deem tongue Black Land, since foul uncouth. What evil saith I know; I trace copy it, lest fade beyond recall. The Ring misseth, maybe, heat Sauron’s hand, black yet burned like fire, Gil-galad destroyed; maybe gold made hot again, writing would refreshed. But part I risk hurt thing: works Sauron fair. It precious me, though I buy great pain. ‘When I read words, quest ended. For traced writing indeed Isildur guessed, tongue Mordor servants Tower. And said therein already known. For day Sauron first put One, Celebrimbor, maker Three, aware him, afar heard speak words, evil purposes revealed. ‘At I took leave Denethor, even I went northwards, messages came Lo´rien Aragorn passed way, found creature called Gollum. Therefore I went first meet hear tale. Into deadly perils gone alone I dared guess.’ ‘There little need tell them,’ said Aragorn. ‘If man must needs walk sight Black Gate, tread deadly flowers Morgul Vale, perils have. I, too, despaired last, I began homeward journey. And then, fortune, I came suddenly I sought: marks soft feet beside muddy pool. But trail fresh swift, led Mordor away. Along skirts Dead Marshes I followed it, I him. Lurking stagnant mere, peering water dark eve fell, I caught him, Gollum. He covered green slime. He never love me, I fear; bit me, I gentle. Nothing I ever get mouth marks teeth. I deemed worst part journey, road back, watching day night, making walk halter neck, gagged, tamed lack drink food, driving ever towards Mirkwood. I brought last gave Elves, agreed done; I glad rid company, stank. For part I hope never look upon again; Gandalf came endured long speech him.’ ‘Yes, long weary,’ said Gandalf, ‘but without profit. For one thing, tale told loss agreed Bilbo told openly first time; mattered little, since I already guessed it. But I learned first Gollum’s ring came Great River nigh Gladden Fields. And I learned also possessed long. Many lives small kind. The power ring lengthened years far beyond span; power Great Rings wield. ‘And proof enough, Galdor, test I spoke of. Upon ring seen held aloft, round unadorned, letters Isildur reported may still read, one strength set golden thing fire while. That I done, I read: Ash nazg durbatuluˆk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatuluˆk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.’ The change wizard’s voice astounding. Suddenly became menacing, powerful, harsh stone. A shadow seemed pass high sun, porch moment grew dark. All trembled, Elves stopped ears. ‘Never voice dared utter words tongue Imladris, Gandalf Grey,’ said Elrond, shadow passed company breathed more. ‘And let us hope none ever speak again,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Nonetheless I ask pardon, Master Elrond. For tongue soon heard every corner West, let put doubt aside thing indeed Wise declared: treasure Enemy, fraught malice; lies great part strength old. Out Black Years come words Smiths Eregion heard, knew betrayed: One Ring rule all, One Ring find them, One Ring bring Darkness bind them. ‘Know also, friends, I learned yet Gollum. He loth speak tale unclear, beyond doubt went Mordor, knew forced him. Thus Enemy knows One found, long Shire; since servants pursued almost door, soon know, already may know, even I speak, here.’ All sat silent while, length Boromir spoke. ‘He small thing, say, Gollum? Small, great mischief. What became him? To doom put him?’ ‘He prison, worse,’ said Aragorn. ‘He suffered much. There doubt tormented, fear Sauron lies black heart. Still I one glad safely kept watchful Elves Mirkwood. His malice great gives strength hardly believed one lean withered. He could work much mischief still, free. And I doubt allowed leave Mordor evil errand.’ ‘Alas! alas!’ cried Legolas, fair Elvish face great distress. ‘The tidings I sent bring must told. They good, I learned evil may seem company. Sme´agol, called Gollum, escaped.’ ‘Escaped?’ cried Aragorn. ‘That ill news indeed. We shall rue bitterly, I fear. How came folk Thranduil fail trust?’ ‘Not lack watchfulness,’ said Legolas; ‘but perhaps over-kindliness. And fear prisoner aid others, known doings could wish. We guarded creature day night, Gandalf’s bidding, much though wearied task. But Gandalf bade us hope still cure, heart keep ever dungeons earth, would fall back old black thoughts.’ ‘You less tender me,’ said Glo´in flash eyes, old memories stirred imprisonment deep places Elven-king’s halls. ‘Now come!’ said Gandalf. ‘Pray, interrupt, good Glo´in. That regrettable misunderstanding, long set right. If grievances stand Elves Dwarves brought here, may well abandon Council.’ Glo´in rose bowed, Legolas continued. ‘In days fair weather led Gollum woods; high tree standing alone far others liked climb. Often let mount highest branches, felt free wind; set guard tree’s foot. One day refused come down, guards mind climb him: learned trick clinging boughs feet well hands; sat tree far night. ‘It night summer, yet moonless starless, Orcs came us unawares. We drove time; many fierce, came mountains, unused woods. When battle over, found Gollum gone, guards slain taken. It seemed plain us attack made rescue, knew beforehand. How contrived cannot guess; Gollum cunning, spies Enemy many. The dark things weredriven year Dragon’s fall returned greater numbers, Mirkwood evil place, save realm maintained. ‘We failed recapture Gollum. We came trail among many Orcs, plunged deep Forest, going south. But ere long escaped skill, dared continue hunt; drawing nigh Dol Guldur,andthatisstillaveryevilplace;wedonotgothatway.’ ‘Well, well, gone,’ said Gandalf. ‘We time seek again. He must will. But may play part yet neither Sauron foreseen. ‘And I answer Galdor’s questions. What Saruman? What counsels us need? This tale I must tell full, Elrond heard yet, brief; bear must resolve. It last chapter Tale Ring, far yet gone. * * * ‘At end June I Shire, cloud anxiety mind, I rode southern borders little land; I foreboding danger, still hidden drawing near. There messages reached telling war defeat Gondor, I heard Black Shadow chill smote heart. But I found nothing save fugitives South; yet seemed sat fear would speak. I turned east north journeyed along Greenway; far Bree I came upon traveller sitting bank beside road grazing horse beside him. It Radagast Brown, one time dwelt Rhosgobel, near borders Mirkwood. He one order, I seen many year. ‘‘‘Gandalf!’’ cried. ‘‘I seeking you. But I stranger parts. All I knew might found wild region uncouth name Shire.’’ ‘‘‘Your information correct,’’ I said. ‘‘But put way, meet inhabitants. You near borders Shire now. And want me? It must pressing. You never traveller, unless driven great need.’’ ‘‘‘I urgent errand,’’ said. ‘‘My news evil.’’ Then looked him, hedges might ears. ‘‘Nazguˆl,’’ whispered. ‘‘The Nine abroad again. They crossed River secretly moving westward. They taken guise riders black.’’ ‘I knew I dreaded without knowing it. ‘‘‘The Enemy must great need purpose,’’ said Radagast; ‘‘but makes look distant desolate parts, I cannot guess.’’ ‘‘‘What mean?’’ said I. ‘‘‘I told wherever go Riders ask news land called Shire.’’ ‘‘‘The Shire,’’ I said; heart sank. For even Wise might fear withstand Nine, gathered together fell chieftain. A great king sorcerer old, wields deadly fear. ‘‘Who told you, sent you?’’ I asked. ‘‘‘Saruman White,’’ answered Radagast. ‘‘And told say feel need, help; must seek aid once, late.’’ ‘And message brought hope. For Saruman White greatest order. Radagast is, course, worthy Wizard, master shapes changes hue; much lore herbs beasts, birds especially friends. But Saruman long studied arts Enemy himself, thus often able forestall him. It devices Saruman drove Dol Guldur. It might found weapons would drive back Nine. ‘‘‘I go Saruman,’’ I said. ‘‘‘Then must go now,’’ said Radagast; ‘‘for I wasted time looking you, days running short. I told find Midsummer, here. Even set spot, hardly reach Nine discover land seek. I shall turn back once.’’ And mounted would ridden straight off. ‘‘‘Stay moment!’’ I said. ‘‘We shall need help, help things give it. Send messages beasts birds friends. Tell bring news anything bears matter Saruman Gandalf. Let messages sent Orthanc.’’ ‘‘‘I that,’’ said, rode Nine him. ‘I could follow there. I ridden far already day, I weary horse; I needed consider matters. I stayed night Bree, decided I time return Shire. Never I make greater mistake! ‘However, I wrote message Frodo, trusted friend innkeeper send him. I rode away dawn; I came long last dwelling Saruman. That far south Isengard, end Misty Mountains, far Gap Rohan. And Boromir tell great open vale lies Misty Mountains northmost foothills Ered Nimrais, White Mountains home. But Isengard circle sheer rocks enclose valley wall, midst valley tower stone called Orthanc. It made Saruman, Men Nu´menor long ago; tall many secrets; yet looks work craft. It cannot reached save passing circle Isengard; circle one gate. ‘Late one evening I came gate, like great arch wall rock; strongly guarded. But keepers gate watch told Saruman awaited me. I rode arch, gate closed silently behind me, suddenly I afraid, though I knew reason it. ‘But I rode foot Orthanc, came stair Saruman; met led high chamber. He wore ring finger. ‘‘‘So come, Gandalf,’’ said gravely; eyes seemed white light, cold laughter heart. ‘‘‘Yes, I come,’’ I said. ‘‘I come aid, Saruman White.’’ And title seemed anger him. ‘‘‘Have indeed, Gandalf Grey!’’ scoffed. ‘‘For aid? It seldom heard Gandalf Grey sought aid, one cunning wise, wandering lands, concerning every business, whether belongs not.’’ ‘I looked wondered. ‘‘But I deceived,’’ said I, ‘‘things moving require union strength.’’ ‘‘‘That may so,’’ said, ‘‘but thought late coming you. How long, I wonder, concealed me, head Council, matter greatest import? What brings lurking-place Shire?’’ ‘‘‘The Nine come forth again,’’ I answered. ‘‘They crossed River. So Radagast said me.’’ ‘‘‘Radagast Brown!’’ laughed Saruman, longer concealed scorn. ‘‘Radagast Bird-tamer! Radagast Simple! Radagast Fool! Yet wit play part I set him. For come, purpose message. And stay, Gandalf Grey, rest journeys. For I Saruman Wise, Saruman Ring-maker, Saruman Many Colours!’’ ‘I looked saw robes, seemed white, so, woven colours, moved shimmered changed hue eye bewildered. ‘‘‘I liked white better,’’ I said. ‘‘‘White!’’ sneered. ‘‘It serves beginning. White cloth may dyed. The white page overwritten; white light broken.’’ ‘‘‘In case longer white,’’ said I. ‘‘And breaks thing find left path wisdom.’’ ‘‘‘You need speak one fools take friends,’’ said he. ‘‘I brought hither instructed you, give choice.’’ ‘He drew began declaim, making speech long rehearsed. ‘‘The Elder Days gone. The Middle Days passing. The Younger Days beginning. The time Elves over, time hand: world Men, must rule. But must power, power order things will, good Wise see. ‘‘‘And listen, Gandalf, old friend helper!’’ said, coming near speaking softer voice. ‘‘I said we, may be, join me. A new Power rising. Against old allies policies avail us all. There hope left Elves dying Nu´menor. This one choice you, us. We may join Power. It would wise, Gandalf. There hope way. Its victory hand; rich reward aided it. As Power grows, proved friends also grow; Wise, I, may patience come last direct courses, control it. We bide time, keep thoughts hearts, deploring maybe evils done way, approving high ultimate purpose: Knowledge, Rule, Order; things far striven vain accomplish, hindered rather helped weak idle friends. There need be, would be, real change designs, means.’’ ‘‘‘Saruman,’’ I said, ‘‘I heard speeches kind before, mouths emissaries sent Mordor deceive ignorant. I cannot think brought far weary ears.’’ ‘He looked sidelong, paused considering. ‘‘Well, I see wise course commend you,’’ said. ‘‘Not yet? Not better way contrived?’’ ‘He came laid long hand arm. ‘‘And not, Gandalf?’’ whispered. ‘‘Why not? The Ruling Ring? If could command that, Power would pass us. That truth I brought here. For I many eyes service, I believe know precious thing lies. Is so? Or Nine ask Shire, business there?’’ As said lust could conceal shone suddenly eyes. ‘‘‘Saruman,’’ I said, standing away him, ‘‘only one hand time wield One, know well, trouble say we! But I would give it, nay, I would give even news you, I learn mind. You head Council, unmasked last. Well, choices are, seems, submit Sauron, yourself. I take neither. Have others offer?’’ ‘He cold perilous. ‘‘Yes,’’ said. ‘‘I expect show wisdom, even behalf; I gave chance aiding willingly, saving much trouble pain. The third choice stay here, end.’’ ‘‘‘Until end?’’ ‘‘‘Until reveal One may found. I may find means persuade you. Or found despite, Ruler time turn lighter matters: devise, say, fitting reward hindrance insolence Gandalf Grey.’’ ‘‘‘That may prove one lighter matters,’’ said I. He laughed me, words empty, knew it. ‘They took set alone pinnacle Orthanc, place Saruman accustomed watch stars. There descent save narrow stair many thousand steps, valley seems far away. I looked saw that, whereas green fair, filled pits forges. Wolves orcs housed Isengard, Saruman mustering great force account, rivalry Sauron service, yet. Over works dark smoke hung wrapped sides Orthanc. I stood alone island clouds; I chance escape, days bitter. I pierced cold, I little room pace fro, brooding coming Riders North. ‘That Nine indeed arisen I felt assured, apart words Saruman might lies. Long ere I came Isengard I heard tidings way could mistaken. Fear ever heart friends Shire; still I hope. I hoped Frodo set forth once, letter urged, reached Rivendell deadly pursuit began. And fear hope proved ill-founded. For hope founded fat man Bree; fear founded cunning Sauron. But fat men sell ale many calls answer; power Sauron still less fear makes it. But circle Isengard, trapped alone, easy think hunters fled fallen would falter Shire far away.’ ‘I saw you!’ cried Frodo. ‘You walking backwards forwards. The moon shone hair.’ Gandalf paused astonished looked him. ‘It dream,’ said Frodo, ‘but suddenly came back me. I quite forgotten it. It came time ago; I left Shire, I think.’ ‘Then late coming,’ said Gandalf, ‘as see. I evil plight. And know agree I seldom need, bear misfortune well. Gandalf Grey caught like fly spider’s treacherous web! Yet even subtle spiders may leave weak thread. ‘At first I feared, Saruman doubt intended, Radagast also fallen. Yet I caught hint anything wrong voice eye meeting. If I had, I never gone Isengard, I gone warily. So Saruman guessed, concealed mind deceived messenger. It would useless case try win honest Radagast treachery. He sought good faith, persuaded me. ‘That undoing Saruman’s plot. For Radagast knew reason I asked; rode away towards Mirkwood many friends old. And Eagles Mountains went far wide, saw many things: gathering wolves mustering Orcs; Nine Riders going hither thither lands; heard news escape Gollum. And sent messenger bring tidings me. ‘So summer waned, came night moon, Gwaihir Windlord, swiftest Great Eagles, came unlooked-for Orthanc; found standing pinnacle. Then I spoke bore away, Saruman aware. I far Isengard, ere wolves orcs issued gate pursue me. ‘‘‘How far bear me?’’ I said Gwaihir. ‘‘‘Many leagues,’’ said he, ‘‘but ends earth. I sent bear tidings burdens.’’ ‘‘‘Then I must steed land,’’ I said, ‘‘and steed surpassingly swift, I never need haste before.’’ ‘‘‘Then I bear Edoras, Lord Rohan sits halls,’’ said; ‘‘for far off.’’ And I glad, Riddermark Rohan Rohirrim, Horse-lords, dwell, horses like bred great vale Misty Mountains White. ‘‘‘Are Men Rohan still trusted, think?’’ I said Gwaihir, treason Saruman shaken faith. ‘‘‘They pay tribute horses,’’ answered, ‘‘and send many yearly Mordor, said; yet yoke. But Saruman become evil, say, doom cannot long delayed.’’ ‘He set land Rohan ere dawn; I lengthened tale long. The rest must brief. In Rohan I found evil already work: lies Saruman; king land would listen warnings. He bade take horse gone; I chose one much liking, little his. I took best horse land, I never seen like him.’ ‘Then must noble beast indeed,’ said Aragorn; ‘and grieves many tidings might seem worse learn Sauron levies tribute. It last I land.’ ‘Nor now, I swear,’ said Boromir. ‘It lie comes Enemy. I know Men Rohan, true valiant, allies, dwelling still lands gave long ago.’ ‘The shadow Mordor lies distant lands,’ answered Aragorn. ‘Saruman fallen it. Rohan beset. Who knows find there, ever return?’ ‘Not least,’ said Boromir, ‘that buy lives horses. They love horses next kin. And without reason, horses Riddermark come fields North, far Shadow, race, masters, descended free days old.’ ‘True indeed!’ said Gandalf. ‘And one among might foaled morning world. The horses Nine cannot vie him; tireless, swift flowing wind. Shadowfax called him. By day coat glistens like silver; night like shade, passes unseen. Light footfall! Never man mounted him, I took I tamed him, speedily bore I reached Shire Frodo Barrow-downs, though I set Rohan set Hobbiton. ‘But fear grew I rode. Ever I came north I heard tidings Riders, though I gained day day, ever me. They divided forces, I learned: remained eastern borders, far Greenway, invaded Shire south. I came Hobbiton Frodo gone; I words old Gamgee. Many words point. He much say shortcomings new owners Bag End. ‘‘‘I can’t abide changes,’’ said he, ‘‘not time life, least changes worst.’’ ‘‘Changes worst,’’ repeated many times. ‘‘‘Worst bad word,’’ I said him, ‘‘and I hope live see it.’’ But amidst talk I gathered last Frodo left Hobbiton less week before, black horseman come Hill evening. Then I rode fear. I came Buckland found uproar, busy hive ants stirred stick. I came house Crickhollow, broken open empty; threshold lay cloak Frodo’s. Then hope left me, I wait gather news, I might comforted; I rode trail Riders. It hard follow, went many ways, I loss. But seemed one two ridden towards Bree; way I went, I thought words might said innkeeper. ‘‘‘Butterbur call him,’’ thought I. ‘‘If delay fault, I melt butter him. I roast old fool slow fire.’’ He expected less, saw face fell flat began melt spot.’ ‘What him?’ cried Frodo alarm. ‘He really kind us could.’ Gandalf laughed. ‘Don’t afraid!’ said. ‘I bite, I barked little. So overjoyed I news I got him, stopped quaking, I embraced old fellow. How happened I could guess, I learned Bree night before, gone morning Strider. ‘‘‘Strider!’’ I cried, shouting joy. ‘‘‘Yes, sir, I afraid so, sir,’’ said Butterbur, mistaking me. ‘‘He got them, spite I could do, took him. They behaved queer time here: wilful, might say.’’ ‘‘‘Ass! Fool! Thrice worthy beloved Barliman!’’ said I. ‘‘It’s best news I since Midsummer; it’s worth gold piece least. May beer laid enchantment surpassing excellence seven years!’’ said I. ‘‘Now I take night’s rest, first since I forgotten when.’’ ‘So I stayed night, wondering much become Riders; two yet news Bree, seemed. But night heard more. Five least came west, threw gates passed Bree like howling wind; Bree-folk still shivering expecting end world. I got dawn went them. ‘I know, seems clear happened. Their Captain remained secret away south Bree, two rode ahead village, four invaded Shire. But foiled Bree Crickhollow, returned Captain tidings, left Road unguarded while, except spies. The Captain sent eastward straight across country, rest rode along Road great wrath. ‘I galloped Weathertop like gale, I reached sundown second day Bree – me. They drew away me, felt coming anger dared face Sun sky. But closed round night, I besieged hill-top, old ring Amon Suˆl. I hard put indeed: light flame cannot seen Weathertop since war-beacons old. ‘At sunrise I escaped fled towards north. I could hope more. It impossible find you, Frodo, wilderness, would folly try Nine heels. So I trust Aragorn. But I hoped draw off, yet reach Rivendell ahead send help. Four Riders indeed follow me, turned back made Ford, seems. That helped little, five, nine, camp attacked. ‘I reached last long hard road, Hoarwell Ettenmoors, north. It took nearly fifteen days Weathertop, I could ride among rocks troll-fells, Shadowfax departed. I sent back master; great friendship grown us, I need come call. But I came Rivendell two days Ring, news peril already brought – proved well indeed. ‘And that, Frodo, end account. May Elrond others forgive length it. But thing happened before, Gandalf broke tryst come promised. An account Ring-bearer strange event required, I think. ‘Well, Tale told, first last. Here are, Ring. But yet come nearer purpose. What shall it?’ There silence. At last Elrond spoke again. ‘This grievous news concerning Saruman,’ said; ‘for trusted deep counsels. It perilous study deeply arts Enemy, good ill. But falls betrayals, alas, happened before. Of tales heard day tale Frodo strange me. I known hobbits, save Bilbo here; seems perhaps alone singular I thought him. The world changed much since I last westward roads. ‘The Barrow-wights know many names; Old Forest many tales told: remains outlier northern march. Time squirrel could go tree tree Shire Dunland west Isengard. In lands I journeyed once, many things wild strange I knew. But I forgotten Bombadil, indeed still walked woods hills long ago, even older old. That name. Iarwain Ben-adar called him, oldest fatherless. But many another name since given folk: Forn Dwarves, Orald Northern Men, names beside. He strange creature, maybe I summoned Council.’ ‘He would come,’ said Gandalf. ‘Could still send messages obtain help?’ asked Erestor. ‘It seems power even Ring.’ ‘No, I put so,’ said Gandalf. ‘Say rather Ring power him. He master. But cannot alter Ring itself, break power others. And withdrawn little land, within bounds set, though none see them, waiting perhaps change days, step beyond them.’ ‘But within bounds nothing seems dismay him,’ said Erestor. ‘Would take Ring keep there, ever harmless?’ ‘No,’ said Gandalf, ‘not willingly. He might so, free folk world begged him, would understand need. And given Ring, would soon forget it, likely throw away. Such things hold mind. He would unsafe guardian; alone answer enough.’ ‘But case,’ said Glorfindel, ‘to send Ring would postpone day evil. He far away. We could take back him, unguessed, unmarked spy. And even could, soon late Lord Rings would learn hiding place would bend power towards it. Could power defied Bombadil alone? I think not. I think end, else conquered, Bombadil fall, Last First; Night come.’ ‘I know little Iarwain save name,’ said Galdor; ‘but Glorfindel, I think, right. Power defy Enemy him, unless power earth itself. And yet see Sauron torture destroy hills. What power still remains lies us, Imladris, Cı´rdan Havens, Lo´rien. But strength, strength withstand Enemy, coming Sauron last, else overthrown?’ ‘I strength,’ said Elrond; ‘neither they.’ ‘Then Ring cannot kept ever strength,’ said Glorfindel, ‘two things remain us attempt: send Sea, destroy it.’ ‘But Gandalf revealed us cannot destroy craft possess,’ said Elrond. ‘And dwell beyond Sea would receive it: good ill belongs Middle-earth; us still dwell deal it.’ ‘Then,’ said Glorfindel, ‘let us cast deeps, make lies Saruman come true. For clear even Council feet already crooked path. He knew Ring lost ever, wished us think so; began lust himself. Yet oft lies truth hidden: Sea would safe.’ ‘Not safe ever,’ said Gandalf. ‘There many things deep waters; seas lands may change. And part take thought season, lives Men, passing age world. We seek final end menace, even hope make one.’ ‘And shall find roads Sea,’ said Galdor. ‘If return Iarwain thought dangerous, flight Sea fraught gravest peril. My heart tells Sauron expect us take western way, learns befallen. He soon will. The Nine unhorsed indeed, respite, ere find new steeds swifter. Only waning might Gondor stands march power along coasts North; comes, assailing White Towers Havens, hereafter Elves may escape lengthening shadows Middleearth.’ ‘Long yet march delayed,’ said Boromir. ‘Gondor wanes, say. But Gondor stands, even end strength still strong.’ ‘And yet vigilance longer keep back Nine,’ said Galdor. ‘And roads may find Gondor guard.’ ‘Then,’ said Erestor, ‘there two courses, Glorfindel already declared: hide Ring ever; unmake it. But beyond power. Who read riddle us?’ ‘None so,’ said Elrond gravely. ‘At least none foretell come pass, take road that. But seems clear road must take. The westward road seems easiest. Therefore must shunned. It watched. Too often Elves fled way. Now last must take hard road, road unforeseen. There lies hope, hope be. To walk peril – Mordor. We must send Ring Fire.’ Silence fell again. Frodo, even fair house, looking upon sunlit valley filled noise clear waters, felt dead darkness heart. Boromir stirred, Frodo looked him. He fingering great horn frowning. At length spoke. ‘I understand this,’ said. ‘Saruman traitor, glimpse wisdom? Why speak ever hiding destroying? Why think Great Ring come hands serve us hour need? Wielding Free Lords Free may surely defeat Enemy. That fears, I deem. ‘The Men Gondor valiant, never submit; may beaten down. Valour needs first strength, weapon. Let Ring weapon, power say. Take go forth victory!’ ‘Alas, no,’ said Elrond. ‘We cannot use Ruling Ring. That know well. It belongs Sauron made alone, altogether evil. Its strength, Boromir, great anyone wield will, save already great power own. But holds even deadlier peril. The desire corrupts heart. Consider Saruman. If Wise Ring overthrow Lord Mordor, using arts, would set Sauron’s throne, yet another Dark Lord would appear. And another reason Ring destroyed: long world danger even Wise. For nothing evil beginning. Even Sauron so. I fear take Ring hide it. I take Ring wield it.’ ‘Nor I,’ said Gandalf. Boromir looked doubtfully, bowed head. ‘So it,’ said. ‘Then Gondor must trust weapons have. And least, Wise ones guard Ring, fight on. Mayhap Sword-thatwas-Broken may still stem tide – hand wields inherited heirloom only, sinews Kings Men.’ ‘Who tell?’ said Aragorn. ‘But put test one day.’ ‘May day long delayed,’ said Boromir. ‘For though I ask aid, need it. It would comfort us know others fought also means have.’ ‘Then comforted,’ said Elrond. ‘For powers realms know not, hidden you. Anduin Great flows past many shores, ere comes Argonath Gates Gondor.’ ‘Still might well all,’ said Glo´in Dwarf, ‘if strengths joined, powers used league. Other rings may be, less treacherous, might used need. The Seven lost us – Balin found ring Thro´r, last; naught heard since Thro´r perished Moria. Indeed I may reveal partly hope find ring Balin went away.’ ‘Balin find ring Moria,’ said Gandalf. ‘Thro´r gave Thra´in son, Thra´in Thorin. It taken torment Thra´in dungeons Dol Guldur. I came late.’ ‘Ah, alas!’ cried Glo´in. ‘When day come revenge? But still Three. What Three Rings Elves? Very mighty Rings, said. Do Elf-lords keep them? Yet made Dark Lord long ago. Are idle? I see Elf-lords here. Will say?’ The Elves returned answer. ‘Did hear me, Glo´in?’ said Elrond. ‘The Three made Sauron, ever touch them. But permitted speak. So much hour doubt I may say. They idle. But made weapons war conquest: power. Those made desire strength domination hoarded wealth, understanding, making, healing, preserve things unstained. These things Elves Middle-earth measure gained, though sorrow. But wrought wield Three turn undoing, minds hearts become revealed Sauron, regains One. It would better Three never been. That purpose.’ ‘But would happen, Ruling Ring destroyed, counsel?’ asked Glo´in. ‘We know certain,’ answered Elrond sadly. ‘Some hope Three Rings, Sauron never touched, would become free, rulers might heal hurts world wrought. But maybe One gone, Three fail, many fair things fade forgotten. That belief.’ ‘Yet Elves willing endure chance,’ said Glorfindel, ‘if power Sauron may broken, fear dominion taken away ever.’ ‘Thus return destroying Ring,’ said Erestor, ‘and yet come nearer. What strength finding Fire made? That path despair. Of folly I would say, long wisdom Elrond forbid me.’ ‘Despair, folly?’ said Gandalf. ‘It despair, despair see end beyond doubt. We not. It wisdom recognize necessity, courses weighed, though folly may appear cling false hope. Well, let folly cloak, veil eyes Enemy! For wise, weighs things nicety scales malice. But measure knows desire, desire power; judges hearts. Into heart thought enter refuse it, Ring may seek destroy it. If seek this, shall put reckoning.’ ‘At least while,’ said Elrond. ‘The road must trod, hard. And neither strength wisdom carry us far upon it. This quest may attempted weak much hope strong. Yet oft course deeds move wheels world: small hands must, eyes great elsewhere.’ ‘Very well, well, Master Elrond!’ said Bilbo suddenly. ‘Say more! It plain enough pointing at. Bilbo silly hobbit started affair, Bilbo better finish it, himself. I comfortable here, getting book. If want know, I writing ending it. I thought putting: lived happily ever afterwards end days. It good ending, none worse used before. Now I shall alter that: look like coming true; anyway evidently several chapters, I live write them. It frightful nuisance. When ought I start?’ Boromir looked surprise Bilbo, laughter died lips saw others regarded old hobbit grave respect. Only Glo´in smiled, smile came old memories. ‘Of course, dear Bilbo,’ said Gandalf. ‘If really started affair, might expected finish it. But know well enough starting great claim any, small part played great deeds hero. You need bow! Though word meant, doubt jest making valiant offer. But one beyond strength, Bilbo. You cannot take thing back. It passed on. If need advice longer, I say part ended, unless recorder. Finish book, leave ending unaltered! There still hope it. But get ready write sequel, come back.’ Bilbo laughed. ‘I never known give pleasant advice before,’ said. ‘As unpleasant advice good, I wonder advice bad. Still, I don’t suppose I strength luck left deal Ring. It grown, I not. But tell me: mean they?’ ‘The messengers sent Ring.’ ‘Exactly! And be? That seems Council decide, decide. Elves may thrive speech alone, Dwarves endure great weariness; I old hobbit, I miss meal noon. Can’t think names now? Or put till dinner?’ No one answered. The noon-bell rang. Still one spoke. Frodo glanced faces, turned him. All Council sat downcast eyes, deep thought. A great dread fell him, awaiting pronouncement doom long foreseen vainly hoped might never spoken. An overwhelming longing rest remain peace Bilbo’s side Rivendell filled heart. At last effort spoke, wondered hear words, using small voice. ‘I take Ring,’ said, ‘though I know way.’ * * * Elrond raised eyes looked him, Frodo felt heart pierced sudden keenness glance. ‘If I understand aright I heard,’ said, ‘I think task appointed you, Frodo; find way, one will. This hour Shire-folk, arise quiet fields shake towers counsels Great. Who Wise could foreseen it? Or, wise, expect know it, hour struck? ‘But heavy burden. So heavy none could lay another. I lay you. But take freely, I say choice right; though mighty Elf-friends old, Hador, Hu´rin, Tu´rin, Beren assembled together, seat among them.’ ‘But won’t send alone surely, Master?’ cried Sam, unable contain longer, jumping corner quietly sitting floor. ‘No indeed!’ said Elrond, turning towards smile. ‘You least shall go him. It hardly possible separate him, even summoned secret council not.’ Sam sat down, blushing muttering. ‘A nice pickle landed in, Mr. Frodo!’ said, shaking head. Chapter 3 THE RING GOES SOUTH Later day hobbits held meeting Bilbo’s room. Merry Pippin indignant heard Sam crept Council, chosen Frodo’s companion. ‘It’s unfair,’ said Pippin. ‘Instead throwing out, clapping chains, Elrond goes rewards cheek!’ ‘Rewards!’ said Frodo. ‘I can’t imagine severe punishment. You thinking saying: condemned go hopeless journey, reward? Yesterday I dreamed task done, I could rest here, long while, perhaps good.’ ‘I don’t wonder,’ said Merry, ‘and I wish could. But envying Sam, you. If go, punishment us left behind, even Rivendell. We come long way stiff times. We want go on.’ ‘That’s I meant,’ said Pippin. ‘We hobbits ought stick together, will. I shall go, unless chain up. There must someone intelligence party.’ ‘Then certainly chosen, Peregrin Took!’ said Gandalf, looking window, near ground. ‘But worrying unnecessarily. Nothing decided yet.’ ‘Nothing decided!’ cried Pippin. ‘Then doing? You shut hours.’ ‘Talking,’ said Bilbo. ‘There deal talk, everyone eye-opener. Even old Gandalf. I think Legolas’s bit news Gollum caught even hop, though passed off.’ ‘You wrong,’ said Gandalf. ‘You inattentive. I already heard Gwaihir. If want know, real eye-openers, put it, Frodo; I one surprised.’ ‘Well, anyway,’ said Bilbo, ‘nothing decided beyond choosing poor Frodo Sam. I afraid time might come that, I let off. But ask me, Elrond send fair number, reports come in. Have started yet, Gandalf?’ ‘Yes,’ said wizard. ‘Some scouts sent already. More go tomorrow. Elrond sending Elves, get touch Rangers, maybe Thranduil’s folk Mirkwood. And Aragorn gone Elrond’s sons. We shall scour lands round many long leagues move made. So cheer up, Frodo! You probably make quite long stay here.’ ‘Ah!’ said Sam gloomily. ‘We’ll wait long enough winter come.’ ‘That can’t helped,’ said Bilbo. ‘It’s fault partly, Frodo lad: insisting waiting birthday. A funny way honouring it, I can’t help thinking. Not day I chosen letting S.-B.s Bag End. But is: can’t wait till spring; can’t go till reports come back. When winter first begins bite stones crack frosty night, pools black trees bare, ’tis evil Wild fare. But I afraid luck.’ ‘I afraid will,’ said Gandalf. ‘We can’t start found Riders.’ ‘I thought destroyed flood,’ said Merry. ‘You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,’ said Gandalf. ‘The power master them, stand fall him. We hope unhorsed unmasked, made less dangerous; must find certain. In meantime try forget troubles, Frodo. I know I anything help you; I whisper ears. Someone said intelligence would needed party. He right. I think I shall come you.’ So great Frodo’s delight announcement Gandalf left window-sill, sitting, took hat bowed. ‘I said I think I shall come. Do count anything yet. In matter Elrond much say, friend Strider. Which reminds me, I want see Elrond. I must off.’ ‘How long think I shall here?’ said Frodo Bilbo Gandalf gone. ‘Oh, I don’t know. I can’t count days Rivendell,’ said Bilbo. ‘But quite long, I think. We many good talk. What helping book, making start next? Have thought ending?’ ‘Yes, several, dark unpleasant,’ said Frodo. ‘Oh, won’t do!’ said Bilbo. ‘Books ought good endings. How would do: settled lived together happily ever after?’ ‘It well, ever comes that,’ said Frodo. ‘Ah!’ said Sam. ‘And live? That’s I often wonder.’ For hobbits continued talk think past journey perils lay ahead; virtue land Rivendell soon fear anxiety lifted minds. The future, good ill, forgotten, ceased power present. Health hope grew strong them, content good day came, taking pleasure every meal, every word song. So days slipped away, morning dawned bright fair, evening followed cool clear. But autumn waning fast; slowly golden light faded pale silver, lingering leaves fell naked trees. A wind began blow chill Misty Mountains east. The Hunter’s Moon waxed round night sky, put flight lesser stars. But low South one star shone red. Every night, Moon waned again, shone brighter brighter. Frodo could see window, deep heavens, burning like watchful eye glared trees brink valley. The hobbits nearly two months house Elrond, November gone last shreds autumn, December passing, scouts began return. Some gone north beyond springs Hoarwell Ettenmoors; others gone west, help Aragorn Rangers searched lands far Greyflood, far Tharbad, old North Road crossed river ruined town. Many gone east south; crossed Mountains entered Mirkwood, others climbed pass sources Gladden River, come Wilderland Gladden Fields length reached old home Radagast Rhosgobel. Radagast there; returned high pass called Redhorn Gate. The sons Elrond, Elladan Elrohir, last return; made great journey, passing Silverlode strange country, errand would speak save Elrond. In region messengers discovered signs tidings Riders servants Enemy. Even Eagles Misty Mountains learned fresh news. Nothing seen heard Gollum; wild wolves still gathering, hunting far Great River. Three black horses found drowned flooded Ford. On rocks rapids searchers discovered bodies five more, also long black cloak, slashed tattered. Of Black Riders trace seen, nowhere presence felt. It seemed vanished North. ‘Eight Nine accounted least,’ said Gandalf. ‘It rash sure, yet I think may hope Ringwraiths scattered, obliged return best could Master Mordor, empty shapeless. ‘If so, time begin hunt again. Of course Enemy servants, journey way borders Rivendell pick trail. And careful hard find. But must delay longer.’ Elrond summoned hobbits him. He looked gravely Frodo. ‘The time come,’ said. ‘If Ring set out, must go soon. But go must count errand aided war force. They must pass domain Enemy far aid. Do still hold word, Frodo, Ring-bearer?’ ‘I do,’ said Frodo. ‘I go Sam.’ ‘Then I cannot help much, even counsel,’ said Elrond. ‘I foresee little road; task achieved I know. The Shadow crept feet Mountains, draws nigh even borders Greyflood; Shadow dark me. You meet many foes, open, disguised; may find friends upon way least look it. I send messages, I contrive, I know wide world; perilous lands become may well miscarry, come quicker yourself. ‘And I choose companions go you, far fortune allows. The number must few, since hope speed secrecy. Had I host Elves armour Elder Days, would avail little, save arouse power Mordor. ‘The Company Ring shall Nine; Nine Walkers shall set Nine Riders evil. With faithful servant, Gandalf go; shall great task, maybe end labours. ‘For rest, shall represent Free Peoples World: Elves, Dwarves, Men. Legolas shall Elves; Gimli son Glo´in Dwarves. They willing go least passes Mountains, maybe beyond. For men shall Aragorn son Arathorn, Ring Isildur concerns closely.’ ‘Strider!’ cried Frodo. ‘Yes,’ said smile. ‘I ask leave companion, Frodo.’ ‘I would begged come,’ said Frodo, ‘only I thought going Minas Tirith Boromir.’ ‘I am,’ said Aragorn. ‘And Sword-that-was-Broken shall re-forged ere I set war. But road road lie together many hundreds miles. Therefore Boromir also Company. He valiant man.’ ‘There remain two found,’ said Elrond. ‘These I consider. Of household I may find seems good send.’ ‘But leave place us!’ cried Pippin dismay. ‘We don’t want left behind. We want go Frodo.’ ‘That understand cannot imagine lies ahead,’ said Elrond. ‘Neither Frodo,’ said Gandalf, unexpectedly supporting Pippin. ‘Nor us see clearly. It true hobbits understood danger, would dare go. But would still wish go, wish dared, shamed unhappy. I think, Elrond, matter would well trust rather friendship great wisdom. Even chose us Elf-lord, Glorfindel, could storm Dark Tower, open road Fire power him.’ ‘You speak gravely,’ said Elrond, ‘but I doubt. The Shire, I forebode, free peril; two I thought send back messengers, could, according fashion country, warn people danger. In case, I judge younger two, Peregrin Took, remain. My heart going.’ ‘Then, Master Elrond, lock prison, send home tied sack,’ said Pippin. ‘For otherwise I shall follow Company.’ ‘Let then. You shall go,’ said Elrond, sighed. ‘Now tale Nine filled. In seven days Company must depart.’ The Sword Elendil forged anew Elvish smiths, blade traced device seven stars set crescent Moon rayed Sun, written many runes; Aragorn son Arathorn going war upon marches Mordor. Very bright sword made whole again; light sun shone redly it, light moon shone cold, edge hard keen. And Aragorn gave new name called Andu´ril, Flame West. Aragorn Gandalf walked together sat speaking road perils would meet; pondered storied figured maps books lore house Elrond. Sometimes Frodo them; content lean guidance, spent much time could Bilbo. In last days hobbits sat together evening Hall Fire, among many tales heard told full lay Beren Lu´thien winning Great Jewel; day, Merry Pippin about, Frodo Sam found Bilbo small room. Then Bilbo would read passages book (which still seemed incomplete), scraps verses, would take notes Frodo’s adventures. On morning last day Frodo alone Bilbo, old hobbit pulled bed wooden box. He lifted lid fumbled inside. ‘Here sword,’ said. ‘But broken, know. I took keep safe I’ve forgotten ask smiths could mend it. No time now. So I thought, perhaps, would care this, don’t know?’ He took box small sword old shabby leathern scabbard. Then drew it, polished well-tended blade glittered suddenly, cold bright. ‘This Sting,’ said, thrust little effort deep wooden beam. ‘Take it, like. I shan’t want again, I expect.’ Frodo accepted gratefully. ‘Also this!’ said Bilbo, bringing parcel seemed rather heavy size. He unwound several folds old cloth, held small shirt mail. It close-woven many rings, supple almost linen, cold ice, harder steel. It shone like moonlit silver, studded white gems. With belt pearl crystal. ‘It’s pretty thing, isn’t it?’ said Bilbo, moving light. ‘And useful. It dwarf-mail Thorin gave me. I got back Michel Delving I started, packed luggage. I brought mementoes Journey away me, except Ring. But I expect use this, I don’t need now, except look sometimes. You hardly feel weight put on.’ ‘I look – well, I don’t think I look right it,’ said Frodo. ‘Just I said myself,’ said Bilbo. ‘But never mind looks. You wear outer clothes. Come on! You must share secret me. Don’t tell anybody else! But I feel happier I knew wearing it. I fancy would turn even knives Black Riders,’ ended low voice. ‘Very well, I take it,’ said Frodo. Bilbo put him, fastened Sting upon glittering belt; Frodo put top old weather-stained breeches, tunic, jacket. ‘Just plain hobbit look,’ said Bilbo. ‘But appears surface. Good luck you!’ He turned away looked window, trying hum tune. ‘I cannot thank I should, Bilbo, this, past kindnesses,’ said Frodo. ‘Don’t try!’ said old hobbit, turning round slapping back. ‘Ow!’ cried. ‘You hard slap! But are: Hobbits must stick together, especially Bagginses. All I ask return is: take much care can, bring back news can, old songs tales come by. I’ll best finish book return. I like write second book, I spared.’ He broke turned window again, singing softly. I sit beside fire think I seen, meadow-flowers butterflies summers been; Of yellow leaves gossamer autumns were, morning mist silver sun wind upon hair. I sit beside fire think world winter comes without spring I shall ever see. For still many things I never seen: every wood every spring different green. I sit beside fire think people long ago, people see world I shall never know. But I sit think times before, I listen returning feet voices door. It cold grey day near end December. The East Wind streaming bare branches trees, seething dark pines hills. Ragged clouds hurrying overhead, dark low. As cheerless shadows early evening began fall Company made ready set out. They start dusk, Elrond counselled journey cover night often could, far Rivendell. ‘You fear many eyes servants Sauron,’ said. ‘I doubt news discomfiture Riders already reached him, filled wrath. Soon spies foot wing abroad northern lands. Even sky must beware go way.’ The Company took little gear war, hope secrecy battle. Aragorn Andu´ril weapon, went forth clad rusty green brown, Ranger wilderness. Boromir long sword, fashion like Andu´ril less lineage, bore also shield war-horn. ‘Loud clear sounds valleys hills,’ said, ‘and let foes Gondor flee!’ Putting lips blew blast, echoes leapt rock rock, heard voice Rivendell sprang feet. ‘Slow wind horn again, Boromir,’ said Elrond, ‘until stand borders land, dire need you.’ ‘Maybe,’ said Boromir. ‘But always I let horn cry setting forth, though thereafter may walk shadows, I go forth thief night.’ Gimli dwarf alone wore openly short shirt steelrings, dwarves make light burdens; belt broad-bladed axe. Legolas bow quiver, belt long white knife. The younger hobbits wore swords taken barrow; Frodo took Sting; mail-coat, Bilbo wished, remained hidden. Gandalf bore staff, girt side elven-sword Glamdring, mate Orcrist lay upon breast Thorin Lonely Mountain. All well furnished Elrond thick warm clothes, jackets cloaks lined fur. Spare food clothes blankets needs laden pony, none poor beast brought Bree. The stay Rivendell worked great wonder change him: glossy seemed vigour youth. It Sam insisted choosing him, declaring Bill (as called him) would pine, come. ‘That animal nearly talk,’ said, ‘and would talk, stayed much longer. He gave look plain Mr. Pippin could speak it: don’t let go you, Sam, I’ll follow own.’ So Bill going beast burden, yet member Company seem depressed. Their farewells said great hall fire, waiting Gandalf, yet come house. A gleam firelight came open doors, soft lights glowing many windows. Bilbo huddled cloak stood silent doorstep beside Frodo. Aragorn sat head bowed knees; Elrond knew fully hour meant him. The others could seen grey shapes darkness. Sam standing pony, sucking teeth, staring moodily gloom river roared stonily below; desire adventure lowest ebb. ‘Bill, lad,’ said, ‘you oughtn’t took us. You could stayed et best hay till new grass comes.’ Bill swished tail said nothing. Sam eased pack shoulders, went anxiously mind things stowed it, wondering forgotten anything: chief treasure, cooking gear; little box salt always carried refilled could; good supply pipe-weed (but near enough, I’ll warrant); flint tinder; woollen hose; linen; various small belongings master’s Frodo forgotten Sam stowed bring triumph called for. He went all. ‘Rope!’ muttered. ‘No rope! And last night said yourself: ‘‘Sam, bit rope? You’ll want it, haven’t got it.’’ Well, I’ll want it. I can’t get now.’ At moment Elrond came Gandalf, called Company him. ‘This last word,’ said low voice. ‘The Ring-bearer setting Quest Mount Doom. On alone charge laid: neither cast away Ring, deliver servant Enemy indeed let handle it, save members Company Council, gravest need. The others go free companions, help way. You may tarry, come back, turn aside paths, chance allows. The go, less easy withdraw; yet oath bond laid go will. For yet know strength hearts, cannot foresee may meet upon road.’ ‘Faithless says farewell road darkens,’ said Gimli. ‘Maybe,’ said Elrond, ‘but let vow walk dark, seen nightfall.’ ‘Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,’ said Gimli. ‘Or break it,’ said Elrond. ‘Look far ahead! But go good hearts! Farewell, may blessing Elves Men Free Folk go you. May stars shine upon faces!’ ‘Good ... good luck!’ cried Bilbo, stuttering cold. ‘I don’t suppose able keep diary, Frodo lad, I shall expect full account get back. And don’t long! Farewell!’ Many others Elrond’s household stood shadows watched go, bidding farewell soft voices. There laughter, song music. At last turned away faded silently dusk. They crossed bridge wound slowly long steep paths led cloven vale Rivendell; came length high moor wind hissed heather. Then one glance Last Homely House twinkling strode away far night. At Ford Bruinen left Road turning southwards went narrow paths among folded lands. Their purpose hold course west Mountains many miles days. The country much rougher barren green vale Great River Wilderland side range, going would slow; hoped way escape notice unfriendly eyes. The spies Sauron hitherto seldom seen empty country, paths little known except people Rivendell. Gandalf walked front, went Aragorn, knew land even dark. The others file behind, Legolas whose eyes keen rearguard. The first part journey hard dreary, Frodo remembered little it, save wind. For many sunless days icy blast came Mountains east, garment seemed able keep searching fingers. Though Company well clad, seldom felt warm, either moving rest. They slept uneasily middle day, hollow land, hidden tangled thorn-bushes grew thickets many places. In late afternoon roused watch, took chief meal: cold cheerless rule, could seldom risk lighting fire. In evening went again, always nearly southward could find way. At first seemed hobbits although walked stumbled weary, creeping forward like snails, getting nowhere. Each day land looked much day before. Yet steadily mountains drawing nearer. South Rivendell rose ever higher, bent westwards; feet main range tumbled ever wider land bleak hills, deep valleys filled turbulent waters. Paths winding, led often edge sheer fall, treacherous swamps. They fortnight way weather changed. The wind suddenly fell veered round south. The swift-flowing clouds lifted melted away, sun came out, pale bright. There came cold clear dawn end long stumbling night-march. The travellers reached low ridge crowned ancient hollytrees whose grey-green trunks seemed built stone hills. Their dark leaves shone berries glowed red light rising sun. Away south Frodo could see dim shapes lofty mountains seemed stand across path Company taking. At left high range rose three peaks; tallest nearest stood like tooth tipped snow; great, bare, northern precipice still largely shadow, sunlight slanted upon it, glowed red. Gandalf stood Frodo’s side looked hand. ‘We done well,’ said. ‘We reached borders country Men call Hollin; many Elves lived happier days, Eregion name. Five-andforty leagues crow flies come, though many long miles feet walked. The land weather milder now, perhaps dangerous.’ ‘Dangerous not, real sunrise mighty welcome,’ said Frodo, throwing back hood letting morning light fall face. ‘But mountains ahead us,’ said Pippin. ‘We must turned eastwards night.’ ‘No,’ said Gandalf. ‘But see ahead clear light. Beyond peaks range bends round south-west. There many maps Elrond’s house, I suppose never thought look them?’ ‘Yes I did, sometimes,’ said Pippin, ‘but I don’t remember them. Frodo better head sort thing.’ ‘I need map,’ said Gimli, come Legolas, gazing strange light deep eyes. ‘There land fathers worked old, wrought image mountains many works metal stone, many songs tales. They stand tall dreams: Baraz, Zirak, Shathuˆr. ‘Only I seen afar waking life, I know names, lies Khazad-duˆm, Dwarrowdelf, called Black Pit, Moria Elvish tongue. Yonder stands Barazinbar, Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; beyond Silvertine Cloudyhead: Celebdil White, Fanuidhol Grey, call Zirakzigil Bundushathuˆr. ‘There Misty Mountains divide, arms lies deep-shadowed valley cannot forget: Azanulbizar, Dimrill Dale, Elves call Nanduhirion.’ ‘It Dimrill Dale making,’ said Gandalf. ‘If climb pass called Redhorn Gate, far side Caradhras, shall come Dimrill Stair deep vale Dwarves. There lies Mirrormere, River Silverlode rises icy springs.’ ‘Dark water Kheled-zaˆram,’ said Gimli, ‘and cold springs Kibil-naˆla. My heart trembles thought I may see soon.’ ‘May joy sight, good dwarf!’ said Gandalf. ‘But whatever may do, least cannot stay valley. We must go Silverlode secret woods, Great River, then——’ He paused. ‘Yes, then?’ asked Merry. ‘To end journey – end,’ said Gandalf. ‘We cannot look far ahead. Let us glad first stage safely over. I think rest here, today tonight well. There wholesome air Hollin. Much evil must befall country wholly forgets Elves, dwelt there.’ ‘That true,’ said Legolas. ‘But Elves land race strange us silvan folk, trees grass remember them. Only I hear stones lament them: deep delved us, fair wrought us, high builded us; gone. They gone. They sought Havens long ago.’ That morning lit fire deep hollow shrouded great bushes holly, supper-breakfast merrier since set out. They hurry bed afterwards, expected night sleep in, mean go evening next day. Only Aragorn silent restless. After left Company wandered ridge; stood shadow tree, looking southwards westwards, head posed listening. Then returned brink dell looked others laughing talking. ‘What matter, Strider?’ Merry called up. ‘What looking for? Do miss East Wind?’ ‘No indeed,’ answered. ‘But I miss something. I country Hollin many seasons. No folk dwell now, many creatures live times, especially birds. Yet things silent. I feel it. There sound miles us, voices seem make ground echo. I understand it.’ Gandalf looked sudden interest. ‘But guess reason?’ asked. ‘Is surprise seeing four hobbits, mention rest us, people seldom seen heard?’ ‘I hope it,’ answered Aragorn. ‘But I sense watchfulness, fear, I never before.’ ‘Then must careful,’ said Gandalf. ‘If bring Ranger you, well pay attention him, especially Ranger Aragorn. We must stop talking aloud, rest quietly, set watch.’ It Sam’s turn day take first watch, Aragorn joined him. The others fell asleep. Then silence grew even Sam felt it. The breathing sleepers could plainly heard. The swish pony’s tail occasional movements feet became loud noises. Sam could hear joints creaking, stirred. Dead silence around him, hung clear blue sky, Sun rode East. Away South dark patch appeared, grew, drove north like flying smoke wind. ‘What’s that, Strider? It don’t look like cloud,’ said Sam whisper Aragorn. He made answer, gazing intently sky; long Sam could see approaching. Flocks birds, flying great speed, wheeling circling, traversing land searching something; steadily drawing nearer. ‘Lie flat still!’ hissed Aragorn, pulling Sam shade holly-bush; whole regiment birds broken away suddenly main host, came, flying low, straight towards ridge. Sam thought kind crow large size. As passed overhead, dense throng shadow followed darkly ground below, one harsh croak heard. Not dwindled distance, north west, sky clear would Aragorn rise. Then sprang went wakened Gandalf. ‘Regiments black crows flying land Mountains Greyflood,’ said, ‘and passed Hollin. They natives here; crebain Fangorn Dunland. I know about: possibly trouble away south fleeing; I think spying land. I also glimpsed many hawks flying high sky. I think ought move evening. Hollin longer wholesome us: watched.’ ‘And case Redhorn Gate,’ said Gandalf; ‘and get without seen, I cannot imagine. But think must. As moving soon dark, I afraid right.’ ‘Luckily fire made little smoke, burned low crebain came,’ said Aragorn. ‘It must put lit again.’ ‘Well isn’t plague nuisance!’ said Pippin. The news: fire, move night, broken him, soon woke late afternoon. ‘All pack crows! I looked forward real good meal tonight: something hot.’ ‘Well, go looking forward,’ said Gandalf. ‘There may many unexpected feasts ahead you. For I like pipe smoke comfort, warmer feet. However, certain one thing rate: get warmer get south.’ ‘Too warm, I shouldn’t wonder,’ muttered Sam Frodo. ‘But I’m beginning think it’s time got sight Fiery Mountain, saw end Road, speak. I thought first Redhorn, whatever name is, might it, till Gimli spoke piece. A fair jaw-cracker dwarf-language must be!’ Maps conveyed nothing Sam’s mind, distances strange lands seemed vast quite reckoning. All day Company remained hiding. The dark birds passed again; westering Sun grew red disappeared southwards. At dusk Company set out, turning half east steered course towards Caradhras, far away still glowed faintly red last light vanished Sun. One one white stars sprang forth sky faded. Guided Aragorn struck good path. It looked Frodo like remains ancient road, broad well planned, Hollin mountain-pass. The Moon, full, rose mountains, cast pale light shadows stones black. Many looked worked hands, though lay tumbled ruinous bleak, barren land. It cold chill hour first stir dawn, moon low. Frodo looked sky. Suddenly saw felt shadow pass high stars, moment faded flashed again. He shivered. ‘Did see anything pass over?’ whispered Gandalf, ahead. ‘No, I felt it, whatever was,’ answered. ‘It may nothing, wisp thin cloud.’ ‘It moving fast then,’ muttered Aragorn, ‘and wind.’ * * * Nothing happened night. The next morning dawned even brighter before. But air chill again; already wind turning back towards east. For two nights marched on, climbing steadily ever slowly road wound hills, mountains towered up, nearer nearer. On third morning Caradhras rose them, mighty peak, tipped snow like silver, sheer naked sides, dull red stained blood. There black look sky, sun wan. The wind gone round north-east. Gandalf snuffed air looked back. ‘Winter deepens behind us,’ said quietly Aragorn. ‘The heights away north whiter were; snow lying far shoulders. Tonight shall way high towards Redhorn Gate. We may well seen watchers narrow path, waylaid evil; weather may prove deadly enemy any. What think course now, Aragorn?’ Frodo overheard words, understood Gandalf Aragorn continuing debate begun long before. He listened anxiously. ‘I think good course beginning end, know well, Gandalf,’ answered Aragorn. ‘And perils known unknown grow go on. But must go on; good delaying passage mountains. Further south passes, till one comes Gap Rohan. I trust way since news Saruman. Who knows side marshals Horse-lords serve?’ ‘Who knows indeed!’ said Gandalf. ‘But another way, pass Caradhras: dark secret way spoken of.’ ‘But let us speak again! Not yet. Say nothing others, I beg, plain way.’ ‘We must decide go further,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Then let us weigh matter minds, others rest sleep,’ said Aragorn. In late afternoon, others finishing breakfast, Gandalf Aragorn went aside together stood looking Caradhras. Its sides dark sullen, head grey cloud. Frodo watched them, wondering way debate would go. When returned Company Gandalf spoke, knew decided face weather high pass. He relieved. He could guess dark secret way, mention seemed fill Aragorn dismay, Frodo glad abandoned. ‘From signs seen lately,’ said Gandalf, ‘I fear Redhorn Gate may watched; also I doubts weather coming behind. Snow may come. We must go speed can. Even take us two marches reach top pass. Dark come early evening. We must leave soon get ready.’ ‘I add word advice, I may,’ said Boromir. ‘I born shadow White Mountains know something journeys high places. We shall meet bitter cold, worse, come side. It help us keep secret frozen death. When leave here, still trees bushes, us carry faggot wood, large bear.’ ‘And Bill could take bit more, couldn’t you, lad?’ said Sam. The pony looked mournfully. ‘Very well,’ said Gandalf. ‘But must use wood – unless choice fire death.’ The Company set again, good speed first; soon way became steep difficult. The twisting climbing road many places almost disappeared, blocked many fallen stones. The night grew deadly dark great clouds. A bitter wind swirled among rocks. By midnight climbed knees great mountains. The narrow path wound sheer wall cliffs left, grim flanks Caradhras towered invisible gloom; right gulf darkness land fell suddenly deep ravine. Laboriously climbed sharp slope halted moment top. Frodo felt soft touch face. He put arm saw dim white flakes snow settling sleeve. They went on. But long snow falling fast, filling air, swirling Frodo’s eyes. The dark bent shapes Gandalf Aragorn pace two ahead could hardly seen. ‘I don’t like all,’ panted Sam behind. ‘Snow’s right fine morning, I like bed it’s falling. I wish lot would go Hobbiton! Folk might welcome there.’ Except high moors Northfarthing heavy fall rare Shire, regarded pleasant event chance fun. No living hobbit (save Bilbo) could remember Fell Winter 1311, white wolves invaded Shire frozen Brandywine. Gandalf halted. Snow thick hood shoulders; already ankle-deep boots. ‘This I feared,’ said. ‘What say now, Aragorn?’ ‘That I feared too,’ Aragorn answered, ‘but less things. I knew risk snow, though seldom falls heavily far south, save high mountains. But high yet; still far down, paths usually open winter.’ ‘I wonder contrivance Enemy,’ said Boromir. ‘They say land govern storms Mountains Shadow stand upon borders Mordor. He strange powers many allies.’ ‘His arm grown long indeed,’ said Gimli, ‘if draw snow North trouble us three hundred leagues away.’ ‘His arm grown long,’ said Gandalf. While halted, wind died down, snow slackened almost ceased. They tramped again. But gone furlong storm returned fresh fury. The wind whistled snow became blinding blizzard. Soon even Boromir found hard keep going. The hobbits, bent nearly double, toiled along behind taller folk, plain could go much further, snow continued. Frodo’s feet felt like lead. Pippin dragging behind. Even Gimli, stout dwarf could be, grumbling trudged. The Company halted suddenly, come agreement without words spoken. They heard eerie noises darkness round them. It may trick wind cracks gullies rocky wall, sounds shrill cries, wild howls laughter. Stones began fall mountain-side, whistling heads, crashing path beside them. Every heard dull rumble, great boulder rolled hidden heights above. ‘We cannot go tonight,’ said Boromir. ‘Let call wind will; fell voices air; stones aimed us.’ ‘I call wind,’ said Aragorn. ‘But make say untrue. There many evil unfriendly things world little love go two legs, yet league Sauron, purposes own. Some world longer he.’ ‘Caradhras called Cruel, ill name,’ said Gimli, ‘long years ago, rumour Sauron heard lands.’ ‘It matters little enemy, cannot beat attack,’ said Gandalf. ‘But do?’ cried Pippin miserably. He leaning Merry Frodo, shivering. ‘Either stop are, go back,’ said Gandalf. ‘It good going on. Only little higher, I remember rightly, path leaves cliff runs wide shallow trough bottom long hard slope. We shelter snow, stones – anything else.’ ‘And good going back storm holds,’ said Aragorn. ‘We passed place way offered shelter cliff-wall now.’ ‘Shelter!’ muttered Sam. ‘If shelter, one wall roof make house.’ The Company gathered together close cliff could. It faced southwards, near bottom leaned little, hoped would give protection northerly wind falling stones. But eddying blasts swirled round every side, snow flowed ever denser clouds. They huddled together backs wall. Bill pony stood patiently dejectedly front hobbits, screened little; long drifting snow hocks, went mounting. If larger companions hobbits would soon entirely buried. A great sleepiness came Frodo; felt sinking fast warm hazy dream. He thought fire heating toes, shadows side hearth heard Bilbo’s voice speaking. I don’t think much diary, said. Snowstorms January twelfth: need come back report that! But I wanted rest sleep, Bilbo, Frodo answered effort, felt shaken, came back painfully wakefulness. Boromir lifted ground nest snow. ‘This death halflings, Gandalf,’ said Boromir. ‘It useless sit snow goes heads. We must something save ourselves.’ ‘Give this,’ said Gandalf, searching pack drawing leathern flask. ‘Just mouthful – us. It precious. It miruvor, cordial Imladris. Elrond gave parting. Pass round!’ As soon Frodo swallowed little warm fragrant liquor felt new strength heart, heavy drowsiness left limbs. The others also revived found fresh hope vigour. But snow relent. It whirled thicker ever, wind blew louder. ‘What say fire?’ asked Boromir suddenly. ‘The choice seems near fire death, Gandalf. Doubtless shall hidden unfriendly eyes snow covered us, help us.’ ‘You may make fire, can,’ answered Gandalf. ‘If watchers endure storm, see us, fire no.’ But though brought wood kindlings advice Boromir, passed skill Elf even Dwarf strike flame would hold amid swirling wind catch wet fuel. At last reluctantly Gandalf took hand. Picking faggot held aloft moment, word command, naur edraith ammen! thrust end staff midst it. At great spout green blue flame sprang out, wood flared sputtered. ‘If see, I least revealed them,’ said. ‘I written Gandalf signs read Rivendell mouths Anduin.’ But Company cared longer watchers unfriendly eyes. Their hearts rejoiced see light fire. The wood burned merrily; though round snow hissed, pools slush crept feet, warmed hands gladly blaze. There stood, stooping circle round little dancing blowing flames. A red light tired anxious faces; behind night like black wall. But wood burning fast, snow still fell. The fire burned low, last faggot thrown on. ‘The night getting old,’ said Aragorn. ‘The dawn far off.’ ‘If dawn pierce clouds,’ said Gimli. Boromir stepped circle stared blackness. ‘The snow growing less,’ said, ‘and wind quieter.’ Frodo gazed wearily flakes still falling dark revealed white moment light dying fire; long time could see sign slackening. Then suddenly, sleep beginning creep again, aware wind indeed fallen, flakes becoming larger fewer. Very slowly dim light began grow. At last snow stopped altogether. As light grew stronger showed silent shrouded world. Below refuge white humps domes shapeless deeps beneath path trodden altogether lost; heights hidden great clouds still heavy threat snow. Gimli looked shook head. ‘Caradhras forgiven us,’ said. ‘He snow yet fling us, go on. The sooner go back better.’ To agreed, retreat difficult. It might well prove impossible. Only paces ashes fire snow lay many feet deep, higher heads hobbits; places scooped piled wind great drifts cliff. ‘If Gandalf would go us bright flame, might melt path you,’ said Legolas. The storm troubled little, alone Company remained still light heart. ‘If Elves could fly mountains, might fetch Sun save us,’ answered Gandalf. ‘But I must something work on. I cannot burn snow.’ ‘Well,’ said Boromir, ‘when heads loss bodies must serve, say country. The strongest us must seek way. See! Though snow-clad, path, came up, turned shoulder rock yonder. It snow first began burden us. If could reach point, maybe would prove easier beyond. It furlong off, I guess.’ ‘Then let us force path thither, I!’ said Aragorn. Aragorn tallest Company, Boromir, little less height, broader heavier build. He led way, Aragorn followed him. Slowly moved off, soon toiling heavily. In places snow breast-high, often Boromir seemed swimming burrowing great arms rather walking. Legolas watched smile upon lips, turned others. ‘The strongest must seek way, say you? But I say: let ploughman plough, choose otter swimming, running light grass leaf, snow – Elf.’ With sprang forth nimbly, Frodo noticed first time, though long known it, Elf boots, wore light shoes, always did, feet made little imprint snow. ‘Farewell!’ said Gandalf. ‘I go find Sun!’ Then swift runner firm sand shot away, quickly overtaking toiling men, wave hand passed them, sped distance, vanished round rocky turn. The others waited huddled together, watching Boromir Aragorn dwindled black specks whiteness. At length passed sight. The time dragged on. The clouds lowered, flakes snow came curling again. An hour, maybe, went by, though seemed far longer, last saw Legolas coming back. At time Boromir Aragorn reappeared round bend far behind came labouring slope. ‘Well,’ cried Legolas ran up, ‘I brought Sun. She walking blue fields South, little wreath snow Redhorn hillock troubles all. But I brought back gleam good hope doomed go feet. There greatest wind-drift beyond turn, Strong Men almost buried. They despaired, I returned told drift little wider wall. And side snow suddenly grows less, white coverlet cool hobbit’s toes.’ ‘Ah, I said,’ growled Gimli. ‘It ordinary storm. It ill Caradhras. He love Elves Dwarves, drift laid cut escape.’ ‘But happily Caradhras forgotten Men you,’ said Boromir, came moment. ‘And doughty Men too, I may say it; though lesser men spades might served better. Still, thrust lane drift; may grateful cannot run light Elves.’ ‘But get there, even cut drift?’ said Pippin, voicing thought hobbits. ‘Have hope!’ said Boromir. ‘I weary, I still strength left, Aragorn too. We bear little folk. The others doubt make shift tread path behind us. Come, Master Peregrin! I begin you.’ He lifted hobbit. ‘Cling back! I shall need arms,’ said strode forward. Aragorn Merry came behind. Pippin marvelled strength, seeing passage already forced tool great limbs. Even now, burdened was, widening track followed, thrusting snow aside went. They came length great drift. It flung across mountain-path like sheer sudden wall, crest, sharp shaped knives, reared twice height Boromir; middle passage beaten, rising falling like bridge. On far side Merry Pippin set down, waited Legolas rest Company arrive. After Boromir returned carrying Sam. Behind narrow well-trodden track came Gandalf, leading Bill Gimli perched among baggage. Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo. They passed lane; hardly Frodo touched ground deep rumble rolled fall stones slithering snow. The spray half blinded Company crouched cliff, air cleared saw path blocked behind them. ‘Enough,enough!’criedGimli.‘Wearedepartingasquickly may!’ And indeed last stroke malice mountainseemedtobeexpended,asifCaradhraswassatisfied invaders beaten would dare return. The threat snow lifted; clouds began break light grew broader. As Legolas reported, found snow became steadily shallow went down, even hobbits could trudge along. Soon stood flat shelf head steep slope felt first flakes snow night before. The morning far advanced. From high place looked back westwards lower lands. Far away tumble country lay foot mountain dell started climb pass. Frodo’s legs ached. He chilled bone hungry; head dizzy thought long painful march downhill. Black specks swam eyes. He rubbed them, black specks remained. In distance him, still high lower foothills, dark dots circling air. ‘The birds again!’ said Aragorn, pointing down. ‘That cannot helped now,’ said Gandalf. ‘Whether good evil, nothing us all, must go once. Not even knees Caradhras wait another night-fall!’ A cold wind flowed behind them, turned backs Redhorn Gate, stumbled wearily slope. Caradhras defeated them. Chapter 4 A JOURNEY IN THE DARK It evening, grey light waning fast, halted night. They weary. The mountains veiled deepening dusk, wind cold. Gandalf spared one mouthful miruvor Rivendell. When eaten food called council. ‘We cannot, course, go tonight,’ said. ‘The attack Redhorn Gate tired us out, must rest while.’ ‘And go?’ asked Frodo. ‘We still journey errand us,’ answered Gandalf. ‘We choice go on, return Rivendell.’ Pippin’s face brightened visibly mere mention return Rivendell; Merry Sam looked hopefully. But Aragorn Boromir made sign. Frodo looked troubled. ‘I wish I back there,’ said. ‘But I return without shame – unless indeed way, already defeated?’ ‘You right, Frodo,’ said Gandalf: ‘to go back admit defeat, face worse defeat come. If go back now, Ring must remain there: shall able set again. Then sooner later Rivendell besieged, brief bitter time destroyed. The Ringwraiths deadly enemies, shadows yet power terror would possess Ruling Ring master’s hand again.’ ‘Then must go on, way,’ said Frodo sigh. Sam sank back gloom. ‘There way may attempt,’ said Gandalf. ‘I thought beginning, first I considered journey, try it. But pleasant way, I spoken Company before. Aragorn it, pass mountains least tried.’ ‘If worse road Redhorn Gate, must evil indeed,’ said Merry. ‘But better tell us it, let us know worst once.’ ‘The road I speak leads Mines Moria,’ said Gandalf. Only Gimli lifted head; smouldering fire eyes. On others dread fell mention name. Even hobbits legend vague fear. ‘The road may lead Moria, hope lead Moria?’ said Aragorn darkly. ‘It name ill omen,’ said Boromir. ‘Nor I see need go there. If cannot cross mountains, let us journey southwards, come Gap Rohan, men friendly people, taking road I followed way hither. Or might pass cross Isen Langstrand Lebennin, come Gondor regions nigh sea.’ ‘Things changed since came north, Boromir,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Did hear I told Saruman? With I may business ere over. But Ring must come near Isengard, means prevented. The Gap Rohan closed us go Bearer. ‘As longer road: cannot afford time. We might spend year journey, pass many lands empty harbourless. Yet would safe. The watchful eyes Saruman Enemy them. When came north, Boromir, Enemy’s eyes one stray wanderer South matter small concern him: mind busy pursuit Ring. But return member Ring’s Company, peril long remain us. The danger increase every league go south naked sky. ‘Since open attempt mountain-pass plight become desperate, I fear. I see little hope, soon vanish sight while, cover trail. Therefore I advise go neither mountains, round them, them. That road rate Enemy least expect us take.’ ‘We know expects,’ said Boromir. ‘He may watch roads, likely unlikely. In case enter Moria would walk trap, hardly better knocking gates Dark Tower itself. The name Moria black.’ ‘You speak know, liken Moria stronghold Sauron,’ answered Gandalf. ‘I alone ever dungeons Dark Lord, older lesser dwelling Dol Guldur. Those pass gates Barad-duˆr return. But I would lead Moria hope coming again. If Orcs there, may prove ill us, true. But Orcs Misty Mountains scattered destroyed Battle Five Armies. The Eagles report Orcs gathering afar; hope Moria still free. ‘There even chance Dwarves there, deep hall fathers, Balin son Fundin may found. However may prove, one must tread path need chooses!’ ‘I tread path you, Gandalf!’ said Gimli. ‘I go look halls Durin, whatever may wait – find doors shut.’ ‘Good, Gimli!’ said Gandalf. ‘You encourage me. We seek hidden doors together. And come through. In ruins Dwarves, dwarf’s head less easy bewilder Elves Men Hobbits. Yet first time I Moria. I sought long Thra´in son Thro´r lost. I passed through, I came alive!’ ‘I passed Dimrill Gate,’ said Aragorn quietly; ‘but though I also came again, memory evil. I wish enter Moria second time.’ ‘And I don’t wish enter even once,’ said Pippin. ‘Nor me,’ muttered Sam. ‘Of course not!’ said Gandalf. ‘Who would? But question is: follow me, I lead there?’ ‘I will,’ said Gimli eagerly. ‘I will,’ said Aragorn heavily. ‘You followed lead almost disaster snow, said word blame. I follow lead – last warning move you. It Ring, us others I thinking now, you, Gandalf. And I say you: pass doors Moria, beware!’ ‘I go,’ said Boromir; ‘not unless vote whole Company me. What Legolas little folk say? The Ring-bearer’s voice surely heard?’ ‘I wish go Moria,’ said Legolas. The hobbits said nothing. Sam looked Frodo. At last Frodo spoke. ‘I wish go,’ said; ‘but neither I wish refuse advice Gandalf. I beg vote, slept it. Gandalf get votes easier light morning cold gloom. How wind howls!’ At words fell silent thought. They heard wind hissing among rocks trees, howling wailing round empty spaces night. Suddenly Aragorn leapt feet. ‘How wind howls!’ cried. ‘It howling wolf-voices. The Wargs come west Mountains!’ ‘Need wait morning then?’ said Gandalf. ‘It I said. The hunt up! Even live see dawn, wish journey south night wild wolves trail?’ ‘How far Moria?’ asked Boromir. ‘There door south-west Caradhras, fifteen miles crow flies, maybe twenty wolf runs,’ answered Gandalf grimly. ‘Then let us start soon light tomorrow, can,’ said Boromir. ‘The wolf one hears worse orc one fears.’ ‘True!’ said Aragorn, loosening sword sheath. ‘But warg howls, also orc prowls.’ ‘I wish I taken Elrond’s advice,’ muttered Pippin Sam. ‘I good all. There enough breed Bandobras Bullroarer me: howls freeze blood. I don’t ever remember feeling wretched.’ ‘My heart’s right toes, Mr. Pippin,’ said Sam. ‘But aren’t etten yet, stout folk us. Whatever may store old Gandalf, I’ll wager isn’t wolf’s belly.’ For defence night Company climbed top small hill sheltering. It crowned knot old twisted trees, lay broken circle boulder-stones. In midst lit fire, hope darkness silence would keep trail discovery hunting packs. Round fire sat, guard dozed uneasily. Poor Bill pony trembled sweated stood. The howling wolves round them, sometimes nearer sometimes off. In dead night many shining eyes seen peering brow hill. Some advanced almost ring stones. At gap circle great dark wolf-shape could seen halted, gazing them. A shuddering howl broke him, captain summoning pack assault. Gandalf stood strode forward, holding staff aloft. ‘Listen, Hound Sauron!’ cried. ‘Gandalf here. Fly, value foul skin! I shrivel tail snout, come within ring.’ The wolf snarled sprang towards great leap. At moment sharp twang. Legolas loosed bow. There hideous yell, leaping shape thudded ground; Elvish arrow pierced throat. The watching eyes suddenly extinguished. Gandalf Aragorn strode forward, hill deserted; hunting packs fled. All darkness grew silent, cry came sighing wind. The night old, westward waning moon setting, gleaming fitfully breaking clouds. Suddenly Frodo started sleep. Without warning storm howls broke fierce wild camp. A great host Wargs gathered silently attacking every side once. ‘Fling fuel fire!’ cried Gandalf hobbits. ‘Draw blades, stand back back!’ In leaping light, fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw many grey shapes spring ring stones. More followed. Through throat one huge leader Aragorn passed sword thrust; great sweep Boromir hewed head another. Beside Gimli stood stout legs apart, wielding dwarf-axe. The bow Legolas singing. In wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly grow: rose up, great menacing shape like monument ancient king stone set upon hill. Stooping like cloud, lifted burning branch strode meet wolves. They gave back him. High air tossed blazing brand. It flared sudden white radiance like lightning; voice rolled like thunder. ‘Naur edraith ammen! Naur dan ngaurhoth!’ cried. There roar crackle, tree burst leaf bloom blinding flame. The fire leapt tree-top tree-top. The whole hill crowned dazzling light. The swords knives defenders shone flickered. The last arrow Legolas kindled air flew, plunged burning heart great wolf-chieftain. All others fled. Slowly fire died till nothing left falling ash sparks; bitter smoke curled burned tree-stumps, blew darkly hill, first light dawn came dimly sky. Their enemies routed return. ‘What I tell you, Mr. Pippin?’ said Sam, sheathing sword. ‘Wolves won’t get him. That eye-opener, mistake! Nearly singed hair head!’ When full light morning came signs wolves found, looked vain bodies dead. No trace fight remained charred trees arrows Legolas lying hill-top. All undamaged save one point left. ‘It I feared,’ said Gandalf. ‘These ordinary wolves hunting food wilderness. Let us eat quickly go!’ That day weather changed again, almost command power longer use snow, since retreated pass, power wished clear light things moved wild could seen far away. The wind turning north north-west night, failed. The clouds vanished southwards sky opened, high blue. As stood upon hillside, ready depart, pale sunlight gleamed mountain-tops. ‘We must reach doors sunset,’ said Gandalf, ‘or I fear shall reach all. It far, path may winding, Aragorn cannot guide us; seldom walked country, I west wall Moria, long ago. ‘There lies,’ said, pointing away south-eastwards mountains’ sides fell sheer shadows feet. In distance could dimly seen line bare cliffs, midst, taller rest, one great grey wall. ‘When left pass I led southwards, back starting point, may noticed. It well I so, several miles less cross, haste needed. Let us go!’ ‘I know hope,’ said Boromir grimly: ‘that Gandalf find seeks, coming cliff shall find gates lost ever. All choices seem ill, caught wolves wall likeliest chance. Lead on!’ Gimli walked ahead wizard’s side, eager come Moria. Together led Company back towards mountains. The road old Moria west lain along course stream, Sirannon, ran feet cliffs near doors stood. But either Gandalf astray, else land changed recent years; strike stream looked find it, miles southwards start. The morning passing towards noon, still Company wandered scrambled barren country red stones. Nowhere could see gleam water hear sound it. All bleak dry. Their hearts sank. They saw living thing, bird sky; night would bring, caught lost land, none cared think. Suddenly Gimli, pressed ahead, called back them. He standing knoll pointing right. Hurrying saw deep narrow channel. It empty silent, hardly trickle water flowed among brown red-stained stones bed; near side path, much broken decayed, wound way among ruined walls paving-stones ancient highroad. ‘Ah! Here last!’ said Gandalf. ‘This stream ran: Sirannon, Gate-stream, used call it. But happened water, I cannot guess; used swift noisy. Come! We must hurry on. We late.’ The Company footsore tired; trudged doggedly along rough winding track many miles. The sun turned noon began go west. After brief halt hasty meal went again. Before mountains frowned, path lay deep trough land could see higher shoulders far eastward peaks. At length came sharp bend. There road, veering southwards brink channel steep fall land left, turned went due east again. Rounding corner saw low cliff, five fathoms high, broken jagged top. Over trickling water dripped, wide cleft seemed carved fall strong full. ‘Indeed things changed!’ said Gandalf. ‘But mistaking place. There remains Stair Falls. If I remember right, flight steps cut rock side, main road wound away left climbed several loops level ground top. There used shallow valley beyond falls right Walls Moria, Sirannon flowed road beside it. Let us go see things like now!’ They found stone steps without difficulty, Gimli sprang swiftly them, followed Gandalf Frodo. When reached top saw could go way, reason drying Gate-stream revealed. Behind sinking Sun filled cool western sky glimmering gold. Before stretched dark still lake. Neither sky sunset reflected sullen surface. The Sirannon dammed filled valley. Beyond ominous water reared vast cliffs, stern faces pallid fading light: final impassable. No sign gate entrance, fissure crack could Frodo see frowning stone. ‘There Walls Moria,’ said Gandalf, pointing across water. ‘And Gate stood upon time, Elven Door end road Hollin come. But way blocked. None Company, I guess, wish swim gloomy water end day. It unwholesome look.’ ‘We must find way round northern edge,’ said Gimli. ‘The first thing Company climb main path see lead us. Even lake, could get baggage-pony stair.’ ‘But case cannot take poor beast Mines,’ said Gandalf. ‘The road mountains dark road, places narrow steep cannot tread, even can.’ ‘Poor old Bill!’ said Frodo. ‘I thought that. And poor Sam! I wonder say?’ ‘I sorry,’ said Gandalf. ‘Poor Bill useful companion, goes heart turn adrift now. I would travelled lighter brought animal, least one Sam fond of, I way. I feared along obliged take road.’ The day drawing end, cold stars glinting sky high sunset, Company, speed could, climbed slopes reached side lake. In breadth looked two three furlongs widest point. How far stretched away southward could see failing light; northern end half mile stood, stony ridges enclosed valley water’s edge rim open ground. They hurried forward, still mile two go could reach point far shore Gandalf making for; still find doors. When came northernmost corner lake found narrow creek barred way. It green stagnant, thrust like slimy arm towards enclosing hills. Gimli strode forward undeterred, found water shallow, ankle-deep edge. Behind walked file, threading way care, weedy pools sliding greasy stones, footing treacherous. Frodo shuddered disgust touch dark unclean water feet. As Sam, last Company, led Bill dry ground far side, came soft sound: swish, followed plop, fish disturbed still surface water. Turning quickly saw ripples, black-edged shadow waning light: great rings widening outwards point far lake. There bubbling noise, silence. The dusk deepened, last gleams sunset veiled cloud. Gandalf pressed great pace, others followed quickly could. They reached strip dry land lake cliffs: narrow, often hardly dozen yards across, encumbered fallen rock stones; found way, hugging cliff, keeping far dark water might. A mile southwards along shore came upon holly trees. Stumps dead boughs rotting shallows, remains seemed old thickets, hedge lined road across drowned valley. But close cliff stood, still strong living, two tall trees, larger trees holly Frodo ever seen imagined. Their great roots spread wall water. Under looming cliffs looked like mere bushes, seen far top Stair; towered overhead, stiff, dark, silent, throwing deep night-shadows feet, standing like sentinel pillars end road. ‘Well, last!’ said Gandalf. ‘Here Elvenway Hollin ended. Holly token people land, planted mark end domain; West-door made chiefly use traffic Lords Moria. Those happier days, still close friendship times folk different race, even Dwarves Elves.’ ‘It fault Dwarves friendship waned,’ said Gimli. ‘I heard fault Elves,’ said Legolas. ‘I heard both,’ said Gandalf; ‘and I give judgement now. But I beg two, Legolas Gimli, least friends, help me. I need both. The doors shut hidden, sooner find better. Night hand!’ Turning others said: ‘While I searching, make ready enter Mines? For I fear must say farewell good beast burden. You must lay aside much stuff brought bitter weather: need inside, nor, I hope, come journey South. Instead us must take share pony carried, especially food water-skins.’ ‘But can’t leave poor old Bill behind forsaken place, Mr. Gandalf!’ cried Sam, angry distressed. ‘I won’t it, that’s flat. After come far all!’ ‘I sorry, Sam,’ said wizard. ‘But Door opens I think able drag Bill inside, long dark Moria. You choose Bill master.’ ‘He’d follow Mr. Frodo dragon’s den, I led him,’ protested Sam. ‘It’d nothing short murder turn loose wolves about.’ ‘It short murder, I hope,’ said Gandalf. He laid hand pony’s head, spoke low voice. ‘Go words guard guiding you,’ said. ‘You wise beast, learned much Rivendell. Make ways places find grass, come time Elrond’s house, wherever wish go. ‘There, Sam! He quite much chance escaping wolves getting home have.’ Sam stood sullenly pony returned answer. Bill, seeming understand well going on, nuzzled him, putting nose Sam’s ear. Sam burst tears, fumbled straps, unlading pony’s packs throwing ground. The others sorted goods, making pile could left behind, dividing rest. When done turned watch Gandalf. He appeared done nothing. He standing two trees gazing blank wall cliff, would bore hole eyes. Gimli wandering about, tapping stone axe. Legolas pressed rock, listening. ‘Well, ready,’ said Merry; ‘but Doors? I can’t see sign them.’ ‘Dwarf-doors made seen shut,’ said Gimli. ‘They invisible, makers cannot find open them, secret forgotten.’ ‘But Door made secret known Dwarves,’ said Gandalf, coming suddenly life turning round. ‘Unless things altogether changed, eyes know look may discover signs.’ He walked forward wall. Right shadow trees smooth space, passed hands fro, muttering words breath. Then stepped back. ‘Look!’ said. ‘Can see anything now?’ The Moon shone upon grey face rock; could see nothing else while. Then slowly surface, wizard’s hands passed, faint lines appeared, like slender veins silver running stone. At first pale gossamer-threads, fine twinkled fitfully Moon caught them, steadily grew broader clearer, design could guessed. At top, high Gandalf could reach, arch interlacing letters Elvish character. Below, though threads places blurred broken, outline could seen anvil hammer surmounted crown seven stars. Beneath two trees, bearing crescent moons. More clearly else shone forth middle door single star many rays. ‘There emblems Durin!’ cried Gimli. ‘And Tree High Elves!’ said Legolas. ‘And Star House Fe¨anor,’ said Gandalf. ‘They wrought ithildin mirrors starlight moonlight, sleeps touched one speaks words long forgotten Middle-earth. It long since I heard them, I thought deeply I could recall mind.’ ‘What writing say?’ asked Frodo, trying decipher inscription arch. ‘I thought I knew elf-letters, I cannot read these.’ ‘The words elven-tongue West Middleearth Elder Days,’ answered Gandalf. ‘But say anything importance us. They say only: The Doors Durin, Lord Moria. Speak, friend, enter. And underneath small faint written: I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor Hollin drew signs.’ ‘What mean speak, friend, enter?’ asked Merry. ‘That plain enough,’ said Gimli. ‘If friend, speak password, doors open, enter.’ ‘Yes,’ said Gandalf, ‘these doors probably governed words. Some dwarf-gates open special times, particular persons; locks keys still needed necessary times words known. These doors key. In days Durin secret. They usually stood open doorwards sat here. But shut, knew opening word could speak pass in. At least recorded, not, Gimli?’ ‘It is,’ said dwarf. ‘But word remembered. Narvi craft kindred vanished earth.’ ‘But know word, Gandalf?’ asked Boromir surprise. ‘No!’ said wizard. The others looked dismayed; Aragorn, knew Gandalf well, remained silent unmoved. ‘Then use bringing us accursed spot?’ cried Boromir, glancing back shudder dark water. ‘You told us passed Mines. How could be, know enter?’ ‘The answer first question, Boromir,’ said wizard, ‘is I know word – yet. But shall soon see. And,’ added, glint eyes bristling brows, ‘you may ask use deeds proved useless. As question: doubt tale? Or wits left? I enter way. I came East. ‘If wish know, I tell doors open outwards. From inside may thrust open hands. From outside nothing move save spell command. They cannot forced inwards.’ ‘What going then?’ asked Pippin, undaunted wizard’s bristling brows. ‘Knock doors head, Peregrin Took,’ said Gandalf. ‘But shatter them, I allowed little peace foolish questions, I seek opening words. ‘I knew every spell tongues Elves Men Orcs, ever used purpose. I still remember ten score without searching mind. But trials, I think, needed; I shall call Gimli words secret dwarf-tongue teach none. The opening words Elvish, like writing arch: seems certain.’ He stepped rock again, lightly touched staff silver star middle beneath sign anvil. Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen! Fennas nogothrim, lasto beth lammen! said commanding voice. The silver lines faded, blank grey stone stir. Many times repeated words different order, varied them. Then tried spells, one another, speaking faster louder, soft slow. Then spoke many single words Elvish speech. Nothing happened. The cliff towered night, countless stars kindled, wind blew cold, doors stood fast. Again Gandalf approached wall, lifting arms spoke tones command rising wrath. Edro, edro! cried, struck rock staff. Open, open! shouted, followed command every language ever spoken West Middleearth. Then threw staff ground, sat silence. At moment far wind bore listening ears howling wolves. Bill pony started fear, Sam sprang side whispered softly him. ‘Do let run away!’ said Boromir. ‘It seems shall need still, wolves find us. How I hate foul pool!’ He stooped picking large stone cast far dark water. The stone vanished soft slap; instant swish bubble. Great rippling rings formed surface beyond stone fallen, moved slowly towards foot cliff. ‘Why that, Boromir?’ said Frodo. ‘I hate place, too, I afraid. I don’t know what: wolves, dark behind doors, something else. I afraid pool. Don’t disturb it!’ ‘I wish could get away!’ said Merry. ‘Why doesn’t Gandalf something quick?’ said Pippin. Gandalf took notice them. He sat head bowed, either despair anxious thought. The mournful howling wolves heard again. The ripples water grew came closer; already lapping shore. With suddenness startled wizard sprang feet. He laughing! ‘I it!’ cried. ‘Of course, course! Absurdly simple, like riddles see answer.’ Picking staff stood rock said clear voice: Mellon! The star shone briefly faded again. Then silently great doorway outlined, though crack joint visible before. Slowly divided middle swung outwards inch inch, doors lay back wall. Through opening shadowy stair could seen climbing steeply up; beyond lower steps darkness deeper night. The Company stared wonder. ‘I wrong all,’ said Gandalf, ‘and Gimli too. Merry, people, right track. The opening word inscribed archway time! The translation been: Say ‘‘Friend’’ enter. I speak Elvish word friend doors opened. Quite simple. Too simple learned lore-master suspicious days. Those happier times. Now let us go!’ He strode forward set foot lowest step. But moment several things happened. Frodo felt something seize ankle, fell cry. Bill pony gave wild neigh fear, turned tail dashed away along lakeside darkness. Sam leaped him, hearing Frodo’s cry ran back again, weeping cursing. The others swung round saw waters lake seething, host snakes swimming southern end. Out water long sinuous tentacle crawled; pale-green luminous wet. Its fingered end hold Frodo’s foot, dragging water. Sam knees slashing knife. The arm let go Frodo, Sam pulled away, crying help. Twenty arms came rippling out. The dark water boiled, hideous stench. ‘Into gateway! Up stairs! Quick!’ shouted Gandalf leaping back. Rousing horror seemed rooted Sam ground stood, drove forward. They time. Sam Frodo steps up, Gandalf begun climb, groping tentacles writhed across narrow shore fingered cliff-wall doors. One came wriggling threshold, glistening starlight. Gandalf turned paused. If considering word would close gate within, need. Many coiling arms seized doors either side, horrible strength, swung round. With shattering echo slammed, light lost. A noise rending crashing came dully ponderous stone. Sam,clingingtoFrodo’sarm,collapsedonastepintheblack darkness. ‘Poor old Bill!’ said choking voice. ‘Poor old Bill!Wolvesandsnakes!Butthesnakesweretoomuchforhim. I choose, Mr. Frodo. I come you.’ They heard Gandalf go back steps thrust staff doors. There quiver stone stairs trembled, doors open. * * * ‘Well, well!’ said wizard. ‘The passage blocked behind us now, one way – side mountains. I fear sounds boulders piled up, trees uprooted thrown across gate. I sorry; trees beautiful, stood long.’ ‘I felt something horrible near moment foot first touched water,’ said Frodo. ‘What thing, many them?’ ‘I know,’ answered Gandalf; ‘but arms guided one purpose. Something crept, driven dark waters mountains. There older fouler things Orcs deep places world.’ He speak aloud thought whatever dwelt lake, seized Frodo first among Company. Boromir muttered breath, echoing stone magnified sound hoarse whisper could hear: ‘In deep places world! And thither going wish. Who lead us deadly dark?’ ‘I will,’ said Gandalf, ‘and Gimli shall walk me. Follow staff!’ As wizard passed ahead great steps, held staff aloft, tip came faint radiance. The wide stairway sound undamaged. Two hundred steps counted, broad shallow; top found arched passage level floor leading dark. ‘Let us sit rest something eat, landing, since can’t find dining-room!’ said Frodo. He begun shake terror clutching arm, suddenly felt extremely hungry. The proposal welcomed all; sat upper steps, dim figures gloom. After eaten, Gandalf gave third sip miruvor Rivendell. ‘It last much longer, I afraid,’ said; ‘but I think need horror gate. And unless great luck, shall need left see side! Go carefully water, too! There many streams wells Mines, touched. We may chance filling skins bottles till come Dimrill Dale.’ ‘How long going take us?’ asked Frodo. ‘I cannot say,’ answered Gandalf. ‘It depends many chances. But going straight, without mishap losing way, shall take three four marches, I expect. It cannot less forty miles West-door East-gate direct line, road may wind much.’ After brief rest started way again. All eager get journey quickly possible, willing, tired were, go marching still several hours. Gandalf walked front before. In left hand held glimmering staff, light showed ground feet; right held sword Glamdring. Behind came Gimli, eyes glinting dim light turned head side side. Behind dwarf walked Frodo, drawn short sword, Sting. No gleam came blades Sting Glamdring; comfort, work Elvish smiths Elder Days swords shone cold light, Orcs near hand. Behind Frodo went Sam, Legolas, young hobbits, Boromir. In dark rear, grim silent, walked Aragorn. The passage twisted round turns, began descend. It went steadily long became level again. The air grew hot stifling, foul, times felt currents cooler air upon faces, issuing half-guessed openings walls. There many these. In pale ray wizard’s staff, Frodo caught glimpses stairs arches, passages tunnels, sloping up, running steeply down, opening blankly dark either side. It bewildering beyond hope remembering. Gimli aided Gandalf little, except stout courage. At least not, others, troubled mere darkness itself. Often wizard consulted points choice way doubtful; always Gandalf final word. The Mines Moria vast intricate beyond imagination Gimli, Glo´in’s son, dwarf mountain-race though was. To Gandalf far-off memories journey long little help, even gloom despite windings road knew whither wished go, falter, long path led towards goal. ‘Do afraid!’ said Aragorn. There pause longer usual, Gandalf Gimli whispering together; others crowded behind, waiting anxiously. ‘Do afraid! I many journey, never one dark; tales Rivendell greater deeds I seen. He go astray – path find. He led us fears, lead us again, whatever cost himself. He surer finding way home blind night cats Queen Beru´thiel.’ It well Company guide. They fuel means making torches; desperate scramble doors many things left behind. But without light would soon come grief. There many roads choose from, also many places holes pitfalls, dark wells beside path passing feet echoed. There fissures chasms walls floor, every crack would open right feet. The widest seven feet across, long Pippin could summon enough courage leap dreadful gap. The noise churning water came far below, great mill-wheel turning depths. ‘Rope!’ muttered Sam. ‘I knew I’d want it, I hadn’t got it!’ As dangers became frequent march became slower. Already seemed tramping on, on, endlessly mountains’ roots. They weary, yet seemed comfort thought halting anywhere. Frodo’s spirits risen escape, food draught cordial; deep uneasiness, growing dread, crept again. Though healed Rivendell knifestroke, grim wound without effect. His senses sharper aware things could seen. One sign change soon noticed could see dark companions, save perhaps Gandalf. And case bearer Ring: hung upon chain breast, whiles seemed heavy weight. He felt certainty evil ahead evil following; said nothing. He gripped tighter hilt sword went doggedly. The Company behind spoke seldom, hurried whispers. There sound sound feet: dull stump Gimli’s dwarf-boots; heavy tread Boromir; light step Legolas; soft, scarceheard patter hobbit-feet; rear slow firm footfalls Aragorn long stride. When halted moment heard nothing all, unless occasionally faint trickle drip unseen water. Yet Frodo began hear, imagine heard, something else: like faint fall soft bare feet. It never loud enough, near enough, feel certain heard it; started never stopped, Company moving. But echo, halted pattered little itself, grew still. * * * It nightfall entered Mines. They going several hours brief halts, Gandalf came first serious check. Before stood wide dark arch opening three passages: led general direction, eastwards; left-hand passage plunged down, right-hand climbed up, middle way seemed run on, smooth level narrow. ‘I memory place all!’ said Gandalf, standing uncertainly arch. He held staff hope finding marks inscription might help choice; nothing kind seen. ‘I weary decide,’ said, shaking head. ‘And I expect weary I am, wearier. We better halt left night. You know I mean! In ever dark; outside late Moon riding westward middle-night passed.’ ‘Poor old Bill!’ said Sam. ‘I wonder is. I hope wolves haven’t got yet.’ To left great arch found stone door: half closed, swung back easily gentle thrust. Beyond seemed lie wide chamber cut rock. ‘Steady! Steady!’ cried Gandalf, Merry Pippin pushed forward, glad find place could rest least feeling shelter open passage. ‘Steady! You know inside yet. I go first.’ He went cautiously, others filed behind. ‘There!’ said, pointing staff middle floor. Before feet saw large round hole like mouth well. Broken rusty chains lay edge trailed black pit. Fragments stone lay near. ‘One might fallen still wondering going strike bottom,’ said Aragorn Merry. ‘Let guide go first one.’ ‘This seems guardroom, made watching three passages,’ said Gimli. ‘That hole plainly well guards’ use, covered stone lid. But lid broken, must take care dark.’ Pippin felt curiously attracted well. While others unrolling blankets making beds walls chamber, far possible hole floor, crept edge peered over. A chill air seemed strike face, rising invisible depths. Moved sudden impulse groped loose stone, let drop. He felt heart beat many times sound. Then far below, stone fallen deep water cavernous place, came plunk, distant, magnified repeated hollow shaft. ‘What’s that?’ cried Gandalf. He relieved Pippin confessed done; angry, Pippin could see eye glinting. ‘Fool Took!’ growled. ‘This serious journey, hobbit walking-party. Throw next time, nuisance. Now quiet!’ Nothing heard several minutes; came depths faint knocks: tom-tap, tap-tom. They stopped, echoes died away, repeated: tap-tom, tom-tap, tap-tap, tom. They sounded disquietingly like signals sort; knocking died away heard again. ‘That sound hammer, I never heard one,’ said Gimli. ‘Yes,’ said Gandalf, ‘and I like it. It may nothing Peregrin’s foolish stone; probably something disturbed would better left quiet. Pray, nothing kind again! Let us hope shall get rest without trouble. You, Pippin, go first watch, reward,’ growled, rolled blanket. Pippin sat miserably door pitch dark; kept turning round, fearing unknown thing would crawl well. He wished could cover hole, blanket, dared move go near it, even though Gandalf seemed asleep. Actually Gandalf awake, though lying still silent. He deep thought, trying recall every memory former journey Mines, considering anxiously next course take; false turn might disastrous. After hour rose came Pippin. ‘Get corner sleep, lad,’ said kindly tone. ‘You want sleep, I expect. I cannot get wink, I may well watching.’ ‘I know matter me,’ muttered, sat door. ‘I need smoke! I tasted since morning snowstorm.’ The last thing Pippin saw, sleep took him, dark glimpse old wizard huddled floor, shielding glowing chip gnarled hands knees. The flicker moment showed sharp nose, puff smoke. It Gandalf roused sleep. He sat watched alone six hours, let others rest. ‘And watches I made mind,’ said. ‘I like feel middle way; I like smell left-hand way: foul air there, I guide. I shall take right-hand passage. It time began climb again.’ For eight dark hours, counting two brief halts, marched on; met danger, heard nothing, saw nothing faint gleam wizard’s light, bobbing like will-o’-the-wisp front them. The passage chosen wound steadily upwards. As far could judge went great mounting curves, rose grew loftier wider. There openings galleries tunnels either side, floor level sound, without pits cracks. Evidently struck important road; went forward quicker done first march. In way advanced fifteen miles, measured direct line east, though must actually walked twenty miles more. As road climbed upwards, Frodo’s spirits rose little; still felt oppressed, still times heard, thought heard, away behind Company beyond fall patter feet, following footstep echo. They marched far hobbits could endure without rest, thinking place could sleep, suddenly walls right left vanished. They seemed passed arched doorway black empty space. There great draught warmer air behind them, darkness cold faces. They halted crowded anxiously together. Gandalf seemed pleased. ‘I chose right way,’ said. ‘At last coming habitable parts, I guess far eastern side. But high up, good deal higher Dimrill Gate, unless I mistaken. From feeling air must wide hall. I risk little real light.’ He raised staff, brief instant blaze like flash lightning. Great shadows sprang fled, second saw vast roof far heads upheld many mighty pillars hewn stone. Before either side stretched huge empty hall; black walls, polished smooth glass, flashed glittered. Three entrances saw, dark black arches: one straight eastwards, one either side. Then light went out. ‘That I shall venture present,’ said Gandalf. ‘There used great windows mountainside, shafts leading light upper reaches Mines. I think reached now, night outside again, cannot tell morning. If I right, tomorrow may actually see morning peeping in. But meanwhile better go further. Let us rest, can. Things gone well far, greater part dark road over. But yet, long way Gates open world.’ The Company spent night great cavernous hall, huddled close together corner escape draught: seemed steady inflow chill air eastern archway. All lay hung darkness, hollow immense, oppressed loneliness vastness dolven halls endlessly branching stairs passages. The wildest imaginings dark rumour ever suggested hobbits fell altogether short actual dread wonder Moria. ‘There must mighty crowd dwarves one time,’ said Sam; ‘and every one busier badgers five hundred years make this, hard rock too! What for? They didn’t live darksome holes surely?’ ‘These holes,’ said Gimli. ‘This great realm city Dwarrowdelf. And old darksome, full light splendour, still remembered songs.’ He rose standing dark began chant deep voice, echoes ran away roof. The world young, mountains green, No stain yet Moon seen, No words laid stream stone When Durin woke walked alone. He named nameless hills dells; He drank yet untasted wells; He stooped looked Mirrormere, And saw crown stars appear, As gems upon silver thread, Above shadow head. The world fair, mountains tall, In Elder Days fall Of mighty kings Nargothrond And Gondolin, beyond The Western Seas passed away: The world fair Durin’s Day. A king carven throne In many-pillared halls stone With golden roof silver floor, And runes power upon door. The light sun star moon In shining lamps crystal hewn Undimmed cloud shade night There shone ever fair bright. There hammer anvil smote, There chisel clove, graver wrote; There forged blade, bound hilt; The delver mined, mason built. There beryl, pearl, opal pale, And metal wrought like fishes’ mail, Buckler corslet, axe sword, And shining spears laid hoard. Unwearied Durin’s folk; Beneath mountains music woke: The harpers harped, minstrels sang, And gates trumpets rang. The world grey, mountains old, The forge’s fire ashen-cold; No harp wrung, hammer falls: The darkness dwells Durin’s halls; The shadow lies upon tomb In Moria, Khazad-duˆm. But still sunken stars appear In dark windless Mirrormere; There lies crown water deep, Till Durin wakes sleep. ‘I like that!’ said Sam. ‘I like learn it. In Moria, Khazad-duˆm! But makes darkness seem heavier, thinking lamps. Are piles jewels gold lying still?’ Gimli silent. Having sung song would say more. ‘Piles jewels?’ said Gandalf. ‘No. The Orcs often plundered Moria; nothing left upper halls. And since dwarves fled, one dares seek shafts treasuries deep places: drowned water – shadow fear.’ ‘Then dwarves want come back for?’ asked Sam. ‘For mithril,’ answered Gandalf. ‘The wealth Moria gold jewels, toys Dwarves; iron, servant. Such things found here, true, especially iron; need delve them: things desired could obtain traffic. For alone world found Moria-silver, true-silver called it: mithril Elvish name. The Dwarves name tell. Its worth ten times gold, beyond price; little left ground, even Orcs dare delve it. The lodes lead away north towards Caradhras, darkness. The Dwarves tell tale; even mithril foundation wealth, also destruction: delved greedily deep, disturbed fled, Durin’s Bane. Of brought light Orcs gathered nearly all, given tribute Sauron, covets it. ‘Mithril! All folk desired it. It could beaten like copper, polished like glass; Dwarves could make metal, light yet harder tempered steel. Its beauty like common silver, beauty mithril tarnish grow dim. The Elves dearly loved it, among many uses made ithildin, starmoon, saw upon doors. Bilbo corslet mithril-rings Thorin gave him. I wonder become it? Gathering dust still Michel Delving Mathom-house, I suppose.’ ‘What?’ cried Gimli, startled silence. ‘A corslet Moria-silver? That kingly gift!’ ‘Yes,’ said Gandalf. ‘I never told him, worth greater value whole Shire everything it.’ Frodo said nothing, put hand tunic touched rings mail-shirt. He felt staggered think walking price Shire jacket. Had Bilbo known? He felt doubt Bilbo knew quite well. It indeed kingly gift. But thoughts carried away dark Mines, Rivendell, Bilbo, Bag End days Bilbo still there. He wished heart back there, days, mowing lawn, pottering among flowers, never heard Moria, mithril – Ring. A deep silence fell. One one others fell asleep. Frodo guard. As breath came unseen doors deep places, dread came him. His hands cold brow damp. He listened. All mind given listening nothing else two slow hours; heard sound, even imagined echo footfall. His watch nearly over, when, far guessed western archway stood, fancied could see two pale points light, almost like luminous eyes. He started. His head nodded. ‘I must nearly fallen asleep guard,’ thought. ‘I edge dream.’ He stood rubbed eyes, remained standing, peering dark, relieved Legolas. When lay quickly went sleep, seemed dream went on: heard whispers, saw two pale points light approaching, slowly. He woke found others speaking softly near him, dim light falling face. High eastern archway shaft near roof came long pale gleam; across hall northern arch light also glimmered faint distantly. Frodo sat up. ‘Good morning!’ said Gandalf. ‘For morning last. I right, see. We high east side Moria. Before today ought find Great Gates see waters Mirrormere lying Dimrill Dale us.’ ‘I shall glad,’ said Gimli. ‘I looked Moria, great, become dark dreadful; found sign kindred. I doubt Balin ever came here.’ After breakfasted Gandalf decided go once. ‘We tired, shall rest better outside,’ said. ‘I think none us wish spend another night Moria.’ ‘No indeed!’ said Boromir. ‘Which way shall take? Yonder eastward arch?’ ‘Maybe,’ said Gandalf. ‘But I know yet exactly are. Unless I quite astray, I guess north Great Gates; may easy find right road them. The eastern arch probably prove way must take; make minds ought look us. Let us go towards light north door. If could find window would help, I fear light comes deep shafts.’ Following lead Company passed northern arch. They found wide corridor. As went along glimmer grew stronger, saw came doorway right. It high flat-topped, stone door still upon hinges, standing half open. Beyond large square chamber. It dimly lit, eyes, long time dark, seemed dazzlingly bright, blinked entered. Their feet disturbed deep dust upon floor, stumbled among things lying doorway whose shapes could first make out. The chamber lit wide shaft high eastern wall; slanted upwards and, far above, small square patch blue sky could seen. The light shaft fell directly table middle room: single oblong block, two feet high, upon laid great slab white stone. ‘It looks like tomb,’ muttered Frodo, bent forwards curious sense foreboding, look closely it. Gandalf came quickly side. On slab runes deeply graven: ‘These Daeron’s Runes, used old Moria,’ said Gandalf. ‘Here written tongues Men Dwarves: balin son fundin lord moria.’ ‘He dead then,’ said Frodo. ‘I feared so.’ Gimli cast hood face. Chapter 5 THE BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-DUˆ M The Company Ring stood silent beside tomb Balin. Frodo thought Bilbo long friendship dwarf, Balin’s visit Shire long ago. In dusty chamber mountains seemed thousand years ago side world. At length stirred looked up, began search anything would give tidings Balin’s fate, show become folk. There another smaller door side chamber, shaft. By doors could see many bones lying, among broken swords axe-heads, cloven shields helms. Some swords crooked: orc-scimitars blackened blades. There many recesses cut rock walls, large iron-bound chests wood. All broken plundered; beside shattered lid one lay remains book. It slashed stabbed partly burned, stained black dark marks like old blood little could read. Gandalf lifted carefully, leaves cracked broke laid slab. He pored time without speaking. Frodo Gimli standing side could see, gingerly turned leaves, written many different hands, runes, Moria Dale, Elvish script. At last Gandalf looked up. ‘It seems record fortunes Balin’s folk,’ said. ‘I guess began coming Dimrill Dale nigh thirty years ago: pages seem numbers referring years arrival. The top page marked one – three, least two missing beginning. Listen this! ‘We drove orcs great gate guard – I think; next word blurred burned: probably room – slew many bright – I think – sun dale. Flo´i killed arrow. He slew great. Then blur followed Flo´i grass near Mirror mere. The next line two I cannot read. Then comes We taken twentyfirst hall North end dwell in. There I cannot read what. A shaft mentioned. Then Balin set seat Chamber Mazarbul.’ ‘The Chamber Records,’ said Gimli. ‘I guess stand.’ ‘Well, I read long way,’ said Gandalf, ‘except word gold, Durin’s Axe something helm. Then Balin lord Moria. That seems end chapter. After stars another hand begins, I see found truesilver, later word wellforged, something, I it! mithril; last two lines O´ seek upper armouries Third Deep, something go westwards, blur, Hollin gate.’ Gandalf paused set leaves aside. ‘There several pages sort, rather hastily written much damaged,’ said; ‘but I make little light. Now must number leaves missing, begin numbered five, fifth year colony, I suppose. Let see! No, cut stained; I cannot read them. We might better sunlight. Wait! Here something: large bold hand using Elvish script.’ ‘That would Ori’s hand,’ said Gimli, looking wizard’s arm. ‘He could write well speedily, often used Elvish characters.’ ‘I fear ill tidings record fair hand,’ said Gandalf. ‘The first clear word sorrow, rest line lost, unless ends estre. Yes, must yestre followed day tenth novembre Balin lord Moria fell Dimrill Dale. He went alone look Mirror mere. orc shot behind stone. slew orc, many . . . east Silverlode. The remainder page blurred I hardly make anything out, I think I read barred gates, hold long if, perhaps horrible suffer. Poor Balin! He seems kept title took less five years. I wonder happened afterwards; time puzzle last pages. Here last page all.’ He paused sighed. ‘It grim reading,’ said. ‘I fear end cruel. Listen! We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They taken Bridge second hall. Fra´r Lo´ni Na´li fell there. Then four lines smeared I read went 5 days ago. The last lines run pool wall Westgate. The Watcher Water took O´ in. We cannot get out. The end comes, drums, drums deep. I wonder means. The last thing written trailing scrawl elf-letters: coming. There nothing more.’ Gandalf paused stood silent thought. A sudden dread horror chamber fell Company. ‘We cannot get out,’ muttered Gimli. ‘It well us pool sunk little, Watcher sleeping southern end.’ Gandalf raised head looked round. ‘They seem made last stand doors,’ said; ‘but many left time. So ended attempt retake Moria! It valiant foolish. The time come yet. Now, I fear, must say farewell Balin son Fundin. Here must lie halls fathers. We take book, Book Mazarbul, look closely later. You better keep it, Gimli, take back Da´in, get chance. It interest him, though grieve deeply. Come, let us go! The morning passing.’ ‘Which way shall go?’ asked Boromir. ‘Back hall,’ answered Gandalf. ‘But visit room vain. I know are. This must be, Gimli says, Chamber Mazarbul; hall must twenty-first North-end. Therefore leave eastern arch hall, bear right south, go downwards. The Twenty-first Hall Seventh Level, six level Gates. Come now! Back hall!’ Gandalf hardly spoken words, came great noise: rolling Boom seemed come depths far below, tremble stone feet. They sprang towards door alarm. Doom, doom rolled again, huge hands turning caverns Moria vast drum. Then came echoing blast: great horn blown hall, answering horns harsh cries heard off. There hurrying sound many feet. ‘They coming!’ cried Legolas. ‘We cannot get out,’ said Gimli. ‘Trapped!’ cried Gandalf. ‘Why I delay? Here are, caught, before. But I then. We see what——’ Doom, doom came drum-beat walls shook. ‘Slam doors wedge them!’ shouted Aragorn. ‘And keep packs long can: may get chance cut way yet.’ ‘No!’ said Gandalf. ‘We must get shut in. Keep east door ajar! We go way, get chance.’ Another harsh horn-call shrill cries rang out. Feet coming corridor. There ring clatter Company drew swords. Glamdring shone pale light, Sting glinted edges. Boromir set shoulder western door. ‘Wait moment! Do close yet!’ said Gandalf. He sprang forward Boromir’s side drew full height. ‘Who comes hither disturb rest Balin Lord Moria?’ cried loud voice. There rush hoarse laughter, like fall sliding stones pit; amid clamour deep voice raised command. Doom, boom, doom went drums deep. With quick movement Gandalf stepped narrow opening door thrust forward staff. There dazzling flash lit chamber passage outside. For instant wizard looked out. Arrows whined whistled corridor sprang back. ‘There Orcs, many them,’ said. ‘And large evil: black Uruks Mordor. For moment hanging back, something else there. A great cave-troll, I think, one. There hope escape way.’ ‘And hope all, come door well,’ said Boromir. ‘There sound outside yet,’ said Aragorn, standing eastern door listening. ‘The passage side plunges straight stair: plainly lead back towards hall. But good flying blindly way pursuit behind. We cannot block door. Its key gone lock broken, opens inwards. We must something delay enemy first. We make fear Chamber Mazarbul!’ said grimly, feeling edge sword, Andu´ril. Heavy feet heard corridor. Boromir flung door heaved to; wedged broken sword-blades splinters wood. The Company retreated side chamber. But chance fly yet. There blow door made quiver; began grind slowly open, driving back wedges. A huge arm shoulder, dark skin greenish scales, thrust widening gap. Then great, flat, toeless foot forced below. There dead silence outside. Boromir leaped forward hewed arm might; sword rang, glanced aside, fell shaken hand. The blade notched. Suddenly, surprise, Frodo felt hot wrath blaze heart. ‘The Shire!’ cried, springing beside Boromir, stooped, stabbed Sting hideous foot. There bellow, foot jerked back, nearly wrenching Sting Frodo’s arm. Black drops dripped blade smoked floor. Boromir hurled door slammed again. ‘One Shire!’ cried Aragorn. ‘The hobbit’s bite deep! You good blade, Frodo son Drogo!’ There crash door, followed crash crash. Rams hammers beating it. It cracked staggered back, opening grew suddenly wide. Arrows came whistling in, struck northern wall, fell harmlessly floor. There horn-blast rush feet, orcs one another leaped chamber. How many Company could count. The affray sharp, orcs dismayed fierceness defence. Legolas shot two throat. Gimli hewed legs another sprung Balin’s tomb. Boromir Aragorn slew many. When thirteen fallen rest fled shrieking, leaving defenders unharmed, except Sam scratch along scalp. A quick duck saved him; felled orc: sturdy thrust Barrow-blade. A fire smouldering brown eyes would made Ted Sandyman step backwards, seen it. ‘Now time!’ cried Gandalf. ‘Let us go, troll returns!’ But even retreated, Pippin Merry reached stair outside, huge orc-chieftain, almost man-high, clad black mail head foot, leaped chamber; behind followers clustered doorway. His broad flat face swart, eyes like coals, tongue red; wielded great spear. With thrust huge hide shield turned Boromir’s sword bore backwards, throwing ground. Diving Aragorn’s blow speed striking snake charged Company thrust spear straight Frodo. The blow caught right side, Frodo hurled wall pinned. Sam, cry, hacked spear-shaft, broke. But even orc flung truncheon swept scimitar, Andu´ril came upon helm. There flash like flame helm burst asunder. The orc fell cloven head. His followers fled howling, Boromir Aragorn sprang them. Doom, doom went drums deep. The great voice rolled again. ‘Now!’ shouted Gandalf. ‘Now last chance. Run it!’ Aragorn picked Frodo lay wall made stair, pushing Merry Pippin front him. The others followed; Gimli dragged away Legolas: spite peril lingered Balin’s tomb head bowed. Boromir hauled eastern door to, grinding upon hinges: great iron rings either side, could fastened. ‘I right,’ gasped Frodo. ‘I walk. Put down!’ Aragorn nearly dropped amazement. ‘I thought dead!’ cried. ‘Not yet!’ said Gandalf. ‘But time wonder. Off go, you, stairs! Wait minutes bottom, I come soon, go on! Go quickly choose paths leading right downwards.’ ‘We cannot leave hold door alone!’ said Aragorn. ‘Do I say!’ said Gandalf fiercely. ‘Swords use here. Go!’ The passage lit shaft utterly dark. They groped way long flight steps, looked back; could see nothing, except high faint glimmer wizard’s staff. He seemed still standing guard closed door. Frodo breathed heavily leaned Sam, put arms him. They stood peering stairs darkness. Frodo thought could hear voice Gandalf above, muttering words ran sloping roof sighing echo. He could catch said. The walls seemed trembling. Every drum-beats throbbed rolled: doom, doom. Suddenly top stair stab white light. Then dull rumble heavy thud. The drum-beats broke wildly: doom-boom, doom-boom, stopped. Gandalf came flying steps fell ground midst Company. ‘Well, well! That’s over!’ said wizard struggling feet. ‘I done I could. But I met match, nearly destroyed. But don’t stand here! Go on! You without light while: I rather shaken. Go on! Go on! Where you, Gimli? Come ahead me! Keep close behind, you!’ They stumbled wondering happened. Doom, doom went drum-beats again: sounded muffled far away, following. There sound pursuit, neither tramp feet, voice. Gandalf took turns, right left, passage seemed going direction desired. Every descended flight steps, fifty more, lower level. At moment chief danger; dark could see descent, came put feet emptiness. Gandalf felt ground staff like blind man. At end hour gone mile, maybe little more, descended many flights stairs. There still sound pursuit. Almost began hope would escape. At bottom seventh flight Gandalf halted. ‘It getting hot!’ gasped. ‘We ought least level Gates now. Soon I think look left-hand turn take us east. I hope far. I weary. I must rest moment, even orcs ever spawned us.’ Gimli took arm helped seat step. ‘What happened away door?’ asked. ‘Did meet beater drums?’ ‘I know,’ answered Gandalf. ‘But I found suddenly faced something I met before. I could think nothing try put shutting-spell door. I know many; things kind rightly requires time, even door broken strength. ‘As I stood I could hear orc-voices side: moment I thought would burst open. I could hear said; seemed talking hideous language. All I caught ghaˆsh: ‘‘fire’’. Then something came chamber – I felt door, orcs afraid fell silent. It laid hold iron ring, perceived spell. ‘What I cannot guess, I never felt challenge. The counter-spell terrible. It nearly broke me. For instant door left control began open! I speak word Command. That proved great strain. The door burst pieces. Something dark cloud blocking light inside, I thrown backwards stairs. All wall gave way, roof chamber well, I think. ‘I afraid Balin buried deep, maybe something else buried too. I cannot say. But least passage behind us completely blocked. Ah! I never felt spent, passing. And you, Frodo? There time say so, I never delighted life spoke. I feared brave dead hobbit Aragorn carrying.’ ‘What me?’ said Frodo. ‘I alive, whole I think. I bruised pain, bad.’ ‘Well,’ said Aragorn, ‘I say hobbits made stuff tough I never met like it. Had I known, I would spoken softer Inn Bree! That spear-thrust would skewered wild boar!’ ‘Well, skewer me, I glad say,’ said Frodo; ‘though I feel I caught hammer anvil.’ He said more. He found breathing painful. ‘You take Bilbo,’ said Gandalf. ‘There meets eye, I said long ago.’ Frodo wondered remark meant said. They went again. Before long Gimli spoke. He keen eyes dark. ‘I think,’ said, ‘that light ahead. But daylight. It red. What be?’ ‘Ghaˆsh!’ muttered Gandalf. ‘I wonder meant: lower levels fire? Still, go on.’ Soon light became unmistakable, could seen all. It flickering glowing walls away passage them. They could see way: front road sloped swiftly, way ahead stood low archway; growing light came. The air became hot. When came arch Gandalf went through, signing wait. As stood beyond opening saw face lit red glow. Quickly stepped back. ‘There new devilry here,’ said, ‘devised welcome, doubt. But I know are: reached First Deep, level immediately Gates. This Second Hall Old Moria; Gates near: away beyond eastern end, left, quarter mile. Across Bridge, broad stair, along wide road, First Hall, out! But come look!’ They peered out. Before another cavernous hall. It loftier far longer one slept. They near eastern end; westward ran away darkness. Down centre stalked double line towering pillars. They carved like boles mighty trees whose boughs upheld roof branching tracery stone. Their stems smooth black, red glow darkly mirrored sides. Right across floor, close feet two huge pillars great fissure opened. Out fierce red light came, flames licked brink curled bases columns. Wisps dark smoke wavered hot air. ‘If come main road upper halls, trapped here,’ said Gandalf. ‘Let us hope fire lies us pursuit. Come! There time lose.’ Even spoke heard pursuing drum-beat: Doom, doom, doom. Away beyond shadows western end hall came cries horn-calls. Doom, doom: pillars seemed tremble flames quiver. ‘Now last race!’ said Gandalf. ‘If sun shining outside, may still escape. After me!’ He turned left sped across smooth floor hall. The distance greater looked. As ran heard beat echo many hurrying feet behind. A shrill yell went up: seen. There ring clash steel. An arrow whistled Frodo’s head. Boromir laughed. ‘They expect this,’ said. ‘The fire cut off. We wrong side!’ ‘Look ahead!’ called Gandalf. ‘The Bridge near. lt dangerous narrow.’ Suddenly Frodo saw black chasm. At end hall floor vanished fell unknown depth. The outer door could reached slender bridge stone, without kerb rail, spanned chasm one curving spring fifty feet. It ancient defence Dwarves enemy might capture First Hall outer passages. They could pass across single file. At brink Gandalf halted others came pack behind. ‘Lead way, Gimli!’ said. ‘Pippin Merry next. Straight on, stair beyond door!’ Arrows fell among them. One struck Frodo sprang back. Another pierced Gandalf’s hat stuck like black feather. Frodo looked behind. Beyond fire saw swarming black figures: seemed hundreds orcs. They brandished spears scimitars shone red blood firelight. Doom, doom rolled drum-beats, growing louder louder, doom, doom. Legolas turned set arrow string, though long shot small bow. He drew, hand fell, arrow slipped ground. He gave cry dismay fear. Two great trolls appeared; bore great slabs stone, flung serve gangways fire. But trolls filled Elf terror. The ranks orcs opened, crowded away, afraid. Something coming behind them. What could seen: like great shadow, middle dark form, man-shape maybe, yet greater; power terror seemed go it. It came edge fire light faded cloud bent it. Then rush leaped across fissure. The flames roared greet it, wreathed it; black smoke swirled air. Its streaming mane kindled, blazed behind it. In right hand blade like stabbing tongue fire; left held whip many thongs. ‘Ai! ai!’ wailed Legolas. ‘A Balrog! A Balrog come!’ Gimli stared wide eyes. ‘Durin’s Bane!’ cried, letting axe fall covered face. ‘A Balrog,’ muttered Gandalf. ‘Now I understand.’ He faltered leaned heavily staff. ‘What evil fortune! And I already weary.’ The dark figure streaming fire raced towards them. The orcs yelled poured stone gangways. Then Boromir raised horn blew. Loud challenge rang bellowed, like shout many throats cavernous roof. For moment orcs quailed fiery shadow halted. Then echoes died suddenly flame blown dark wind, enemy advanced again. ‘Over bridge!’ cried Gandalf, recalling strength. ‘Fly! This foe beyond you. I must hold narrow way. Fly!’ Aragorn Boromir heed command, still held ground, side side, behind Gandalf far end bridge. The others halted within doorway hall’s end, turned, unable leave leader face enemy alone. The Balrog reached bridge. Gandalf stood middle span, leaning staff left hand, hand Glamdring gleamed, cold white. His enemy halted again, facing him, shadow reached like two vast wings. It raised whip, thongs whined cracked. Fire came nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm. ‘You cannot pass,’ said. The orcs stood still, dead silence fell. ‘I servant Secret Fire, wielder flame Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire avail you, flame Uduˆn. Go back Shadow! You cannot pass.’ The Balrog made answer. The fire seemed die, darkness grew. It stepped forward slowly bridge, suddenly drew great height, wings spread wall wall; still Gandalf could seen, glimmering gloom; seemed small, altogether alone: grey bent, like wizened tree onset storm. From shadow red sword leaped flaming. Glamdring glittered white answer. There ringing clash stab white fire. The Balrog fell back, sword flew molten fragments. The wizard swayed bridge, stepped back pace, stood still. ‘You cannot pass!’ said. With bound Balrog leaped full upon bridge. Its whip whirled hissed. ‘He cannot stand alone!’ cried Aragorn suddenly ran back along bridge. ‘Elendil!’ shouted. ‘I you, Gandalf!’ ‘Gondor!’ cried Boromir leaped him. At moment Gandalf lifted staff, crying aloud smote bridge him. The staff broke asunder fell hand. A blinding sheet white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked. Right Balrog’s feet broke, stone upon stood crashed gulf, rest remained, poised, quivering like tongue rock thrust emptiness. With terrible cry Balrog fell forward, shadow plunged vanished. But even fell swung whip, thongs lashed curled wizard’s knees, dragging brink. He staggered fell, grasped vainly stone, slid abyss. ‘Fly, fools!’ cried, gone. The fires went out, blank darkness fell. The Company stood rooted horror staring pit. Even Aragorn Boromir came flying back, rest bridge cracked fell. With cry Aragorn roused them. ‘Come! I lead now!’ called. ‘We must obey last command. Follow me!’ They stumbled wildly great stairs beyond door, Aragorn leading, Boromir rear. At top wide echoing passage. Along fled. Frodo heard Sam side weeping, found weeping ran. Doom, doom, doom drum-beats rolled behind, mournful slow; doom! They ran on. The light grew them; great shafts pierced roof. They ran swifter. They passed hall, bright daylight high windows east. They fled across it. Through huge broken doors passed, suddenly Great Gates opened, arch blazing light. There guard orcs crouching shadows behind great door-posts towering either side, gates shattered cast down. Aragorn smote ground captain stood path, rest fled terror wrath. The Company swept past took heed them. Out Gates ran sprang huge age-worn steps, threshold Moria. Thus, last, came beyond hope sky felt wind faces. They halt bowshot walls. Dimrill Dale lay them. The shadow Misty Mountains lay upon it, eastwards golden light land. It one hour noon. The sun shining; clouds white high. They looked back. Dark yawned archway Gates mountain-shadow. Faint far beneath earth rolled slow drum-beats: doom. A thin black smoke trailed out. Nothing else seen; dale around empty. Doom. Grief last wholly overcame them, wept long: standing silent, cast upon ground. Doom, doom. The drum-beats faded. Chapter 6 LOTHLO´ RIEN ‘Alas! I fear cannot stay longer,’ said Aragorn. He looked towards mountains held sword. ‘Farewell, Gandalf!’ cried. ‘Did I say you: pass doors Moria, beware? Alas I spoke true! What hope without you?’ He turned Company. ‘We must without hope,’ said. ‘At least may yet avenged. Let us gird weep more! Come! We long road, much do.’ They rose looked them. Northward dale ran glen shadows two great arms mountains, three white peaks shining: Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Caradhras, Mountains Moria. At head glen torrent flowed like white lace endless ladder short falls, mist foam hung air mountains’ feet. ‘Yonder Dimrill Stair,’ said Aragorn, pointing falls. ‘Down deep-cloven way climbs beside torrent come, fortune kinder.’ ‘Or Caradhras less cruel,’ said Gimli. ‘There stands smiling sun!’ He shook fist furthest snow-capped peaks turned away. To east outflung arm mountains marched sudden end, far lands could descried beyond them, wide vague. To south Misty Mountains receded endlessly far sight could reach. Less mile away, little them, still stood high west side dale, lay mere. It long oval, shaped like great spear-head thrust deep northern glen; southern end beyond shadows sunlit sky. Yet waters dark: deep blue like clear evening sky seen lamp-lit room. Its face still unruffled. About lay smooth sward, shelving sides bare unbroken rim. ‘There lies Mirrormere, deep Kheled-zaˆram!’ said Gimli sadly. ‘I remember said: ‘‘May joy sight! But cannot linger there.’’ Now long shall I journey ere I joy again. It I must hasten away, must remain.’ The Company went road Gates. It rough broken, fading winding track heather whin thrust amid cracking stones. But still could seen long ago great paved way wound upwards lowlands Dwarf-kingdom. In places ruined works stone beside path, mounds green topped slender birches, fir-trees sighing wind. An eastward bend led hard sward Mirrormere, far roadside stood single column broken top. ‘That Durin’s Stone!’ cried Gimli. ‘I cannot pass without turning aside moment look wonder dale!’ ‘Be swift then!’ said Aragorn, looking back towards Gates. ‘The Sun sinks early. The Orcs not, maybe, come till dusk, must far away nightfall. The Moon almost spent, dark tonight.’ ‘Come me, Frodo!’ cried dwarf, springing road. ‘I would go without seeing Kheledzaˆram.’ He ran long green slope. Frodo followed slowly, drawn still blue water spite hurt weariness; Sam came behind. Beside standing stone Gimli halted looked up. It cracked weather-worn, faint runes upon side could read. ‘This pillar marks spot Durin first looked Mirrormere,’ said dwarf. ‘Let us look once, ere go!’ They stooped dark water. At first could see nothing. Then slowly saw forms encircling mountains mirrored profound blue, peaks like plumes white flame them; beyond space sky. There like jewels sunk deep shone glinting stars, though sunlight sky above. Of stooping forms shadow could seen. ‘O Kheled-zaˆram fair wonderful!’ said Gimli. ‘There lies Crown Durin till wakes. Farewell!’ He bowed, turned away, hastened back greensward road again. ‘What see?’ said Pippin Sam, Sam deep thought answer. The road turned south went quickly downwards, running arms dale. Some way mere came deep well water, clear crystal, freshet fell stone lip ran glistening gurgling steep rocky channel. ‘Here spring Silverlode rises,’ said Gimli. ‘Do drink it! It icy cold.’ ‘Soon becomes swift river, gathers water many mountain-streams,’ said Aragorn. ‘Our road leads beside many miles. For I shall take road Gandalf chose, first I hope come woods Silverlode flows Great River – yonder.’ They looked pointed, could see stream leaping trough valley, running away lower lands, lost golden haze. ‘There lie woods Lothlo´rien!’ said Legolas. ‘That fairest dwellings people. There trees like trees land. For autumn leaves fall not, turn gold. Not till spring comes new green opens fall, boughs laden yellow flowers; floor wood golden, golden roof, pillars silver, bark trees smooth grey. So still songs Mirkwood say. My heart would glad I beneath eaves wood, springtime!’ ‘My heart glad, even winter,’ said Aragorn. ‘But lies many miles away. Let us hasten!’ For time Frodo Sam managed keep others; Aragorn leading great pace, lagged behind. They eaten nothing since early morning. Sam’s cut burning like fire, head felt light. In spite shining sun wind seemed chill warm darkness Moria. He shivered. Frodo felt every step painful gasped breath. At last Legolas turned, seeing far behind, spoke Aragorn. The others halted, Aragorn ran back, calling Boromir come him. ‘I sorry, Frodo!’ cried, full concern. ‘So much happened day need haste, I forgotten hurt; Sam too. You spoken. We done nothing ease you, ought, though orcs Moria us. Come now! A little place rest little. There I I you. Come, Boromir! We carry them.’ Soon afterwards came upon another stream ran west, joined bubbling water hurrying Silverlode. Together plunged fall green-hued stone, foamed dell. About stood fir-trees, short bent, sides steep clothed harts-tongue shrubs whortle-berry. At bottom level space stream flowed noisily shining pebbles. Here rested. It nearly three hours noon, come miles Gates. Already sun westering. While Gimli two younger hobbits kindled fire brush- fir-wood, drew water, Aragorn tended Sam Frodo. Sam’s wound deep, looked ugly, Aragorn’s face grave examined it. After moment looked relief. ‘Good luck, Sam!’ said. ‘Many received worse payment slaying first orc. The cut poisoned, wounds orc-blades often are. It heal well I tended it. Bathe Gimli heated water.’ He opened pouch drew withered leaves. ‘They dry, virtue gone,’ said, ‘but I still leaves athelas I gathered near Weathertop. Crush one water, wash wound clean, I bind it. Now turn, Frodo!’ ‘I right,’ said Frodo, reluctant garments touched. ‘All I needed food little rest.’ ‘No!’ said Aragorn. ‘We must look see hammer anvil done you. I still marvel alive all.’ Gently stripped Frodo’s old jacket worn tunic, gave gasp wonder. Then laughed. The silver corslet shimmered eyes like light upon rippling sea. Carefully took held up, gems glittered like stars, sound shaken rings like tinkle rain pool. ‘Look, friends!’ called. ‘Here’s pretty hobbit-skin wrap elven-princeling in! If known hobbits hides, hunters Middle-earth would riding Shire.’ ‘And arrows hunters world would vain,’ said Gimli, gazing mail wonder. ‘It mithril-coat. Mithril! I never seen heard tell one fair. Is coat Gandalf spoke of? Then undervalued it. But well given!’ ‘I often wondered Bilbo doing, close little room,’ said Merry. ‘Bless old hobbit! I love ever. I hope get chance telling it!’ There dark blackened bruise Frodo’s right side breast. Under mail shirt soft leather, one point rings driven flesh. Frodo’s left side also scored bruised hurled wall. While others set food ready, Aragorn bathed hurts water athelas steeped. The pungent fragrance filled dell, stooped steaming water felt refreshed strengthened. Soon Frodo felt pain leave him, breath grew easy: though stiff sore touch many days. Aragorn bound soft pads cloth side. ‘The mail marvellously light,’ said. ‘Put again, bear it. My heart glad know coat. Do lay aside, even sleep, unless fortune brings safe while; seldom chance quest lasts.’ When eaten, Company got ready go on. They put fire hid traces it. Then climbing dell took road again. They gone far sun sank behind westward heights great shadows crept mountain-sides. Dusk veiled feet, mist rose hollows. Away east evening light lay pale upon dim lands distant plain wood. Sam Frodo feeling eased greatly refreshed able go fair pace, one brief halt Aragorn led Company nearly three hours. It dark. Deep night fallen. There many clear stars, fast-waning moon would seen till late. Gimli Frodo rear, walking softly speaking, listening sound upon road behind. At length Gimli broke silence. ‘Not sound wind,’ said. ‘There goblins near, ears made wood. It hoped Orcs content driving us Moria. And maybe purpose, nothing else us – Ring. Though Orcs often pursue foes many leagues plain, fallen captain avenge.’ Frodo answer. He looked Sting, blade dull. Yet heard something, thought had. As soon shadows fallen road behind dim, heard quick patter feet. Even heard it. He turned swiftly. There two tiny gleams light behind, moment thought saw them, slipped aside vanished. ‘What it?’ said dwarf. ‘I don’t know,’ answered Frodo. ‘I thought I heard feet, I thought I saw light – like eyes. I thought often, since first entered Moria.’ Gimli halted stooped ground. ‘I hear nothing night-speech plant stone,’ said. ‘Come! Let us hurry! The others sight.’ The night-wind blew chill valley meet them. Before wide grey shadow loomed, heard endless rustle leaves like poplars breeze. ‘Lothlo´rien!’ cried Legolas. ‘Lothlo´rien! We come eaves Golden Wood. Alas winter!’ Under night trees stood tall them, arched road stream ran suddenly beneath spreading boughs. In dim light stars stems grey, quivering leaves hint fallow gold. ‘Lothlo´rien!’ said Aragorn. ‘Glad I hear wind trees! We still little five leagues Gates, go further. Here let us hope virtue Elves keep us tonight peril comes behind.’ ‘If Elves indeed still dwell darkening world,’ said Gimli. ‘It long since folk journeyed hither back land whence wandered ages long ago,’ said Legolas, ‘but hear Lo´rien yet deserted, secret power holds evil land. Nevertheless folk seldom seen, maybe dwell deep woods far northern border.’ ‘Indeed deep wood dwell,’ said Aragorn, sighed memory stirred him. ‘We must fend tonight. We go forward short way, trees us, turn aside path seek place rest in.’ He stepped forward; Boromir stood irresolute follow. ‘Is way?’ said. ‘What fairer way would desire?’ said Aragorn. ‘A plain road, though led hedge swords,’ said Boromir. ‘By strange paths Company led, far evil fortune. Against passed shades Moria, loss. And must enter Golden Wood, say. But perilous land heard Gondor, said come go in; none escaped unscathed.’ ‘Say unscathed, say unchanged, maybe speak truth,’ said Aragorn. ‘But lore wanes Gondor, Boromir, city wise speak evil Lothlo´rien. Believe will, way us – unless would go back Moria-gate, scale pathless mountains, swim Great River alone.’ ‘Then lead on!’ said Boromir. ‘But perilous.’ ‘Perilous indeed,’ said Aragorn, ‘fair perilous; evil need fear it, bring evil them. Follow me!’ They gone little mile forest came upon another stream flowing swiftly tree-clad slopes climbed back westward towards mountains. They heard splashing fall away among shadows right. Its dark hurrying waters ran across path them, joined Silverlode swirl dim pools among roots trees. ‘Here Nimrodel!’ said Legolas. ‘Of stream Silvan Elves made many songs long ago, still sing North, remembering rainbow falls, golden flowers floated foam. All dark Bridge Nimrodel broken down. I bathe feet, said water healing weary.’ He went forward climbed deep-cloven bank stepped stream. ‘Follow me!’ cried. ‘The water deep. Let us wade across! On bank rest, sound falling water may bring us sleep forgetfulness grief.’ One one climbed followed Legolas. For moment Frodo stood near brink let water flow tired feet. It cold touch clean, went mounted knees, felt stain travel weariness washed limbs. When Company crossed, sat rested ate little food; Legolas told tales Lothlo´rien Elves Mirkwood still kept hearts, sunlight starlight upon meadows Great River world grey. At length silence fell, heard music waterfall running sweetly shadows. Almost Frodo fancied could hear voice singing, mingled sound water. ‘Do hear voice Nimrodel?’ asked Legolas. ‘I sing song maiden Nimrodel, bore name stream beside lived long ago. It fair song woodland tongue; runs Westron Speech, Rivendell sing it.’ In soft voice hardly heard amid rustle leaves began: An Elven-maid old, A shining star day: Her mantle white hemmed gold, Her shoes silver-grey. A star bound upon brows, A light hair As sun upon golden boughs In Lo´rien fair. Her hair long, limbs white, And fair free; And wind went light As leaf linden-tree. Beside falls Nimrodel, By water clear cool, Her voice falling silver fell Into shining pool. Where wanders none tell, In sunlight shade; For lost yore Nimrodel And mountains strayed. The elven-ship grey Beneath mountain-lee Awaited many day Beside roaring sea. A wind night Northern lands Arose, loud cried, And drove ship elven-strands Across streaming tide. When dawn came dim land lost, The mountains sinking grey Beyond heaving waves tossed Their plumes blinding spray. Amroth beheld fading shore Now low beyond swell, And cursed faithless ship bore Him far Nimrodel. Of old Elven-king, A lord tree glen, When golden boughs spring In fair Lothlo´rien. From helm sea saw leap, As arrow string, And dive water deep, As mew upon wing. The wind flowing hair, The foam shone; Afar saw strong fair Go riding like swan. But West come word, And Hither Shore No tidings Elven-folk heard Of Amroth evermore. The voice Legolas faltered, song ceased. ‘I cannot sing more,’ said. ‘That part, I forgotten much. It long sad, tells sorrow came upon Lothlo´rien, Lo´rien Blossom, Dwarves awakened evil mountains.’ ‘But Dwarves make evil,’ said Gimli. ‘I said so; yet evil came,’ answered Legolas sadly. ‘Then many Elves Nimrodel’s kindred left dwellings departed, lost far South, passes White Mountains; came ship Amroth lover waited her. But spring wind new leaves echo voice may still heard falls bear name. And wind South voice Amroth comes sea; Nimrodel flows Silverlode, Elves call Celebrant, Celebrant Anduin Great, Anduin flows Bay Belfalas whence Elves Lo´rien set sail. But neither Nimrodel Amroth came ever back. ‘It told house built branches tree grew near falls; custom Elves Lo´rien, dwell trees, maybe still. Therefore called Galadhrim, Tree-people. Deep forest trees great. The people woods delve ground like Dwarves, build strong places stone Shadow came.’ ‘And even latter days dwelling trees might thought safer sitting ground,’ said Gimli. He looked across stream road led back Dimrill Dale, roof dark boughs above. ‘Your words bring good counsel, Gimli,’ said Aragorn. ‘We cannot build house, tonight Galadhrim seek refuge tree-tops, can. We sat beside road already longer wise.’ The Company turned aside path, went shadow deeper woods, westward along mountain-stream away Silverlode. Not far falls Nimrodel found cluster trees, overhung stream. Their great grey trunks mighty girth, height could guessed. ‘I climb up,’ said Legolas. ‘I home among trees, root bough, though trees kind strange me, save name song. Mellyrn called, bear yellow blossom, I never climbed one. I see shape way growth.’ ‘Whatever may be,’ said Pippin, ‘they marvellous trees indeed offer rest night, except birds. I cannot sleep perch!’ ‘Then dig hole ground,’ said Legolas, ‘if afterthefashionofyourkind.Butyoumustdigswiftanddeep, wish hide Orcs.’ He sprang lightly ground caught branch grew trunk high head. But even swung moment, voice spoke suddenly tree-shadows him. ‘Daro!’ said commanding tone, Legolas dropped back earth surprise fear. He shrank bole tree. ‘Stand still!’ whispered others. ‘Do move speak!’ There sound soft laughter heads, another clear voice spoke elven-tongue. Frodo could understand little said, speech Silvan folk east mountains used among unlike West. Legolas looked answered language.* ‘Who they, say?’ asked Merry. ‘They’re Elves,’ said Sam. ‘Can’t hear voices?’ ‘Yes, Elves,’ said Legolas; ‘and say breathe loud could shoot dark.’ Sam hastily put hand mouth. ‘But say also need fear. They aware us long while. They heard voice across Nimrodel, knew I one Northern kindred, therefore hinder crossing; afterwards heard song. Now bid climb Frodo; seem tidings journey. The others ask wait little, keep watch foot tree, decided done.’ * * * * See note Appendix F: Of Elves. Out shadows ladder let down: made rope, silver-grey glimmering dark, though looked slender proved strong enough bear many men. Legolas ran lightly up, Frodo followed slowly; behind came Sam trying breathe loudly. The branches mallorn-tree grew nearly straight trunk, swept upward; near top main stem divided crown many boughs, among found built wooden platform, flet things called days: Elves called talan. It reached round hole centre ladder passed. When Frodo came last flet found Legolas seated three Elves. They clad shadowygrey, could seen among tree-stems, unless moved suddenly. They stood up, one uncovered small lamp gave slender silver beam. He held up, looking Frodo’s face, Sam’s. Then shut light again, spoke words welcome elven-tongue. Frodo spoke haltingly return. ‘Welcome!’ Elf said Common Language, speaking slowly. ‘We seldom use tongue own; dwell heart forest, willingly dealings folk. Even kindred North sundered us. But us still go abroad gathering news watching enemies, speak languages lands. I one. Haldir name. My brothers, Ru´mil Orophin, speak little tongue. ‘But heard rumours coming, messengers Elrond passed Lo´rien way home Dimrill Stair. We heard – hobbits, halflings, many long year, know yet dwelt Middle-earth. You look evil! And since come Elf kindred, willing befriend you, Elrond asked; though custom lead strangers land. But must stay tonight. How many you?’ ‘Eight,’ said Legolas. ‘Myself, four hobbits; two men, one whom, Aragorn, Elf-friend folk Westernesse.’ ‘The name Aragorn son Arathorn known Lo´rien,’ said Haldir, ‘and favour Lady. All well. But yet spoken seven.’ ‘The eighth dwarf,’ said Legolas. ‘A dwarf!’ said Haldir. ‘That well. We dealings Dwarves since Dark Days. They permitted land. I cannot allow pass.’ ‘But Lonely Mountain, one Da´in’s trusty people, friendly Elrond,’ said Frodo. ‘Elrond chose one companions, brave faithful.’ The Elves spoke together soft voices, questioned Legolas tongue. ‘Very good,’ said Haldir last. ‘We this, though liking. If Aragorn Legolas guard him, answer him, shall pass; must go blindfold Lothlo´rien. ‘But must debate longer. Your folk must remain ground. We keeping watch rivers, ever since saw great troop Orcs going north towards Moria, along skirts mountains, many days ago. Wolves howling wood’s borders. If indeed come Moria, peril cannot far behind. Tomorrow early must go on. ‘The four hobbits shall climb stay us – fear them! There another talan next tree. There others must take refuge. You, Legolas, must answer us them. Call us, anything amiss! And eye dwarf!’ Legolas went ladder take Haldir’s message; soon afterwards Merry Pippin clambered high flet. They breath seemed rather scared. ‘There!’ said Merry panting. ‘We lugged blankets well own. Strider hidden rest baggage deep drift leaves.’ ‘You need burdens,’ said Haldir. ‘It cold tree-tops winter, though wind tonight South; food drink give drive away night-chill, skins cloaks spare.’ The hobbits accepted second (and far better) supper gladly. Then wrapped warmly, fur-cloaks Elves, blankets well, tried go sleep. But weary Sam found easy do. Hobbits like heights, sleep upstairs, even stairs. The flet liking bedroom. It walls, even rail; one side light plaited screen, could moved fixed different places according wind. Pippin went talking while. ‘I hope, I go sleep bird-loft, I shan’t roll off,’ said. ‘Once I get sleep,’ said Sam, ‘I shall go sleeping, whether I roll no. And less said, sooner I’ll drop off, take meaning.’ Frodo lay time awake, looked stars glinting pale roof quivering leaves. Sam snoring side long closed eyes. He could dimly see grey forms two elves sitting motionless arms knees, speaking whispers. The gone take watch one lower branches. At last lulled wind boughs above, sweet murmur falls Nimrodel below, Frodo fell asleep song Legolas running mind. Late night woke. The hobbits asleep. The Elves gone. The sickle Moon gleaming dimly among leaves. The wind still. A little way heard harsh laugh tread many feet ground below. There ring metal. The sounds died slowly away, seemed go southward, wood. A head appeared suddenly hole flet. Frodo sat alarm saw grey-hooded Elf. He looked towards hobbits. ‘What it?’ said Frodo. ‘Yrch!’ said Elf hissing whisper, cast flet rope-ladder rolled up. ‘Orcs!’ said Frodo. ‘What doing?’ But Elf gone. There sounds. Even leaves silent, falls seemed hushed. Frodo sat shivered wraps. He thankful caught ground; felt trees offered little protection, except concealment. Orcs keen hounds scent, said, could also climb. He drew Sting: flashed glittered like blue flame; slowly faded grew dull. In spite fading sword feeling immediate danger leave Frodo, rather grew stronger. He got crawled opening peered down. He almost certain could hear stealthy movements tree’s foot far below. Not Elves; woodland folk altogether noiseless movements. Then heard faintly sound like sniffing; something seemed scrabbling bark tree-trunk. He stared dark, holding breath. Something climbing slowly, breath came like soft hissing closed teeth. Then coming up, close stem, Frodo saw two pale eyes. They stopped gazed upward unwinking. Suddenly turned away, shadowy figure slipped round trunk tree vanished. Immediately afterwards Haldir came climbing swiftly branches. ‘There something tree I never seen before,’ said. ‘It orc. It fled soon I touched tree-stem. It seemed wary, skill trees, I might thought one hobbits. ‘I shoot, I dared arouse cries: cannot risk battle. A strong company Orcs passed. They crossed Nimrodel – curse foul feet clean water! – went old road beside river. They seemed pick scent, searched ground near place halted. The three us could challenge hundred, went ahead spoke feigned voices, leading wood. ‘Orophin gone haste back dwellings warn people. None Orcs ever return Lo´rien. And many Elves hidden northern border another night falls. But must take road south soon fully light.’ Day came pale East. As light grew filtered yellow leaves mallorn, seemed hobbits early sun cool summer’s morning shining. Pale-blue sky peeped among moving branches. Looking opening south side flet Frodo saw valley Silverlode lying like sea fallow gold tossing gently breeze. The morning still young cold Company set again, guided Haldir brother Ru´mil. ‘Farewell, sweet Nimrodel!’ cried Legolas. Frodo looked back caught gleam white foam among grey tree-stems. ‘Farewell,’ said. It seemed would never hear running water beautiful, ever blending innumerable notes endless changeful music. They went back path still went along west side Silverlode, way followed southward. There prints orc-feet earth. But soon Haldir turned aside trees halted bank river shadows. ‘There one people yonder across stream,’ said, ‘though may see him.’ He gave call like low whistle bird, thicket young trees Elf stepped, clad grey, hood thrown back; hair glinted like gold morning sun. Haldir skilfully cast stream coil grey rope, caught bound end tree near bank. ‘Celebrant already strong stream here, see,’ said Haldir, ‘and runs swift deep, cold. We set foot far north, unless must. But days watchfulness make bridges. This cross! Follow me!’ He made end rope fast another tree, ran lightly along it, river back again, road. ‘I walk path,’ said Legolas; ‘but others skill. Must swim?’ ‘No!’ said Haldir. ‘We two ropes. We fasten other, one shoulder-high, another halfhigh, holding strangers able cross care.’ When slender bridge made, Company passed over, cautiously slowly, others easily. Of hobbits Pippin proved best sure-footed, walked quickly, holding one hand; kept eyes bank ahead look down. Sam shuffled along, clutching hard, looking pale eddying water chasm mountains. He breathed relief safely across. ‘Live learn! gaffer used say. Though thinking gardening, roosting like bird, trying walk like spider. Not even uncle Andy ever trick like that!’ When length Company gathered east bank Silverlode, Elves untied ropes coiled two them. Ru´mil, remained side, drew back last one, slung shoulder, wave hand went away, back Nimrodel keep watch. ‘Now, friends,’ said Haldir, ‘you entered Naith Lo´rien, Gore, would say, land lies like spearhead arms Silverlode Anduin Great. We allow strangers spy secrets Naith. Few indeed permitted even set foot there. ‘As agreed, I shall blindfold eyes Gimli Dwarf. The others may walk free while, come nearer dwellings, Egladil, Angle waters.’ ThiswasnotatalltothelikingofGimli.‘Theagreementwas made without consent,’ said. ‘I walk blindfold, likeabeggaroraprisoner.AndIamnospy.Myfolkhavenever dealings servants Enemy. Neither done harm Elves. I likely betray Legolas, companions.’ ‘I doubt you,’ said Haldir. ‘Yet law. I master law, cannot set aside. I done much letting set foot Celebrant.’ Gimli obstinate. He planted feet firmly apart, laid hand upon haft axe. ‘I go forward free,’ said, ‘or I go back seek land, I known true word, though I perish alone wilderness.’ ‘You cannot go back,’ said Haldir sternly. ‘Now come thus far, must brought Lord Lady. They shall judge you, hold give leave, will. You cannot cross rivers again, behind secret sentinels cannot pass. You would slain saw them.’ Gimli drew axe belt. Haldir companion bent bows. ‘A plague Dwarves stiff necks!’ said Legolas. ‘Come!’ said Aragorn. ‘If I still lead Company, must I bid. It hard upon Dwarf thus singled out. We blindfold, even Legolas. That best, though make journey slow dull.’ Gimli laughed suddenly. ‘A merry troop fools shall look! Will Haldir lead us string, like many blind beggars one dog? But I content, Legolas shares blindness.’ ‘I Elf kinsman here,’ said Legolas, becoming angry turn. ‘Now let us cry: ‘‘a plague stiff necks Elves!’’’ said Aragorn. ‘But Company shall fare alike. Come, bind eyes, Haldir!’ ‘I shall claim full amends every fall stubbed toe, lead us well,’ said Gimli bound cloth eyes. ‘You claim,’ said Haldir. ‘I shall lead well, paths smooth straight.’ ‘Alas folly days!’ said Legolas. ‘Here enemies one Enemy, yet I must walk blind, sun merry woodland leaves gold!’ ‘Folly may seem,’ said Haldir. ‘Indeed nothing power Dark Lord clearly shown estrangement divides still oppose him. Yet little faith trust find world beyond Lothlo´rien, unless maybe Rivendell, dare trust endanger land. We live upon island amid many perils, hands often upon bowstring upon harp. ‘The rivers long defended us, sure guard more; Shadow crept northward us. Some speak departing, yet already seems late. The mountains west growing evil; east lands waste, full Sauron’s creatures; rumoured cannot safely pass southward Rohan, mouths Great River watched Enemy. Even could come shores Sea, find longer shelter there. It said still havens High Elves, far north west, beyond land Halflings. But may be, though Lord Lady may know, I not.’ ‘You ought least guess, since seen us,’ said Merry. ‘There Elf-havens west land, Shire, Hobbits live.’ ‘Happy folk Hobbits dwell near shores sea!’ said Haldir. ‘It long indeed since folk looked it, yet still remember song. Tell havens walk.’ ‘I cannot,’ said Merry. ‘I never seen them. I never land before. And I known world outside like, I don’t think I heart leave it.’ ‘Not even see fair Lothlo´rien?’ said Haldir. ‘The world indeed full peril, many dark places; still much fair, though lands love mingled grief, grows perhaps greater. ‘Some among us sing Shadow draw back, peace shall come again. Yet I believe world us ever old, light Sun aforetime. For Elves, I fear, prove best truce, may pass Sea unhindered leave Middle-earth ever. Alas Lothlo´rien I love! It would poor life land mallorn grew. But mallorn-trees beyond Great Sea, none reported it.’ As spoke thus, Company filed slowly along paths wood, led Haldir, Elf walked behind. They felt ground beneath feet smooth soft, walked freely, without fear hurt fall. Being deprived sight, Frodo found hearing senses sharpened. He could smell trees trodden grass. He could hear many different notes rustle leaves overhead, river murmuring away right, thin clear voices birds high sky. He felt sun upon face hands passed open glade. As soon set foot upon far bank Silverlode strange feeling come upon him, deepened walked Naith: seemed stepped bridge time corner Elder Days, walking world more. In Rivendell memory ancient things; Lo´rien ancient things still lived waking world. Evil seen heard there, sorrow known; Elves feared distrusted world outside: wolves howling wood’s borders: land Lo´rien shadow lay. All day Company marched on, felt cool evening come heard early night-wind whispering among many leaves. Then rested slept without fear upon ground; guides would permit unbind eyes, could climb. In morning went again, walking without haste. At noon halted, Frodo aware passed shining Sun. Suddenly heard sound many voices around him. A marching host Elves come silently: hastening towards northern borders guard attack Moria; brought news, Haldir reported. The marauding orcs waylaid almost destroyed; remnant fled westward towards mountains, pursued. A strange creature also seen, running bent back hands near ground, like beast yet beast-shape. It eluded capture, shot it, knowing whether good ill, vanished Silverlode southward. ‘Also,’ said Haldir, ‘they bring message Lord Lady Galadhrim. You walk free, even dwarf Gimli. It seems Lady knows member Company. New messages come Rivendell perhaps.’ He removed bandage first Gimli’s eyes. ‘Your pardon!’ said, bowing low. ‘Look us friendly eyes! Look glad, first dwarf behold trees Naith Lo´rien since Durin’s Day!’ When eyes turn uncovered, Frodo looked caught breath. They standing open space. To left stood great mound, covered sward grass green Springtime Elder Days. Upon it, double crown, grew two circles trees: outer bark snowy white, leafless beautiful shapely nakedness; inner mallorn-trees great height, still arrayed pale gold. High amid branches towering tree stood centre gleamed white flet. At feet trees, green hillsides grass studded small golden flowers shaped like stars. Among them, nodding slender stalks, flowers, white palest green: glimmered mist amid rich hue grass. Over sky blue, sun afternoon glowed upon hill cast long green shadows beneath trees. ‘Behold! You come Cerin Amroth,’ said Haldir. ‘For heart ancient realm long ago, mound Amroth, happier days high house built. Here ever bloom winter flowers unfading grass: yellow elanor, pale niphredil. Here stay awhile, come city Galadhrim dusk.’ The others cast upon fragrant grass, Frodo stood awhile still lost wonder. It seemed stepped high window looked vanished world. A light upon language name. All saw shapely, shapes seemed clear cut, first conceived drawn uncovering eyes, ancient endured ever. He saw colour knew, gold white blue green, fresh poignant, moment first perceived made names new wonderful. In winter heart could mourn summer spring. No blemish sickness deformity could seen anything grew upon earth. On land Lo´rien stain. He turned saw Sam standing beside him, looking round puzzled expression, rubbing eyes sure awake. ‘It’s sunlight bright day, right enough,’ said. ‘I thought Elves moon stars: Elvish anything I ever heard tell of. I feel I inside song, take meaning.’ Haldir looked them, seemed indeed take meaning thought word. He smiled. ‘You feel power Lady Galadhrim,’ said. ‘Would please climb Cerin Amroth?’ They followed stepped lightly grass-clad slopes. Though walked breathed, living leaves flowers stirred cool wind fanned face, Frodo felt timeless land fade change fall forgetfulness. When gone passed outer world, still Frodo wanderer Shire would walk there, upon grass among elanor niphredil fair Lothlo´rien. They entered circle white trees. As South Wind blew upon Cerin Amroth sighed among branches. Frodo stood still, hearing far great seas upon beaches long ago washed away, sea-birds crying whose race perished earth. Haldir gone climbing high flet. As Frodo prepared follow him, laid hand upon tree beside ladder: never suddenly keenly aware feel texture tree’s skin life within it. He felt delight wood touch it, neither forester carpenter; delight living tree itself. As stepped last upon lofty platform, Haldir took hand turned towards South. ‘Look way first!’ said. Frodo looked saw, still distance, hill many mighty trees, city green towers: could tell. Out it, seemed power light came held land sway. He longed suddenly fly like bird rest green city. Then looked eastward saw land Lo´rien running pale gleam Anduin, Great River. He lifted eyes across river light went out, back world knew. Beyond river land appeared flat empty, formless vague, far away rose like wall, dark drear. The sun lay Lothlo´rien power enlighten shadow distant height. ‘There lies fastness Southern Mirkwood,’ said Haldir. ‘It clad forest dark fir, trees strive one another branches rot wither. In midst upon stony height stands Dol Guldur, long hidden Enemy dwelling. We fear inhabited again, power sevenfold. A black cloud lies often late. In high place may see two powers opposed one another; ever strive thought, whereas light perceives heart darkness, secret discovered. Not yet.’ He turned climbed swiftly down, followed him. At hill’s foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still silent tree; hand small golden bloom elanor, light eyes. He wrapped fair memory: Frodo looked knew beheld things place. For grim years removed face Aragorn, seemed clothed white, young lord tall fair; spoke words Elvish tongue one Frodo could see. Arwen vanimelda, nama´rie¨! said, drew breath, returning thought looked Frodo smiled. ‘Here heart Elvendom earth,’ said, ‘and heart dwells ever, unless light beyond dark roads still must tread, I. Come me!’ And taking Frodo’s hand his, left hill Cerin Amroth came never living man. Chapter 7 THE MIRROR OF GALADRIEL The sun sinking behind mountains, shadows deepening woods, went again. Their paths went thickets dusk already gathered. Night came beneath trees walked, Elves uncovered silver lamps. Suddenly came open found pale evening sky pricked early stars. There wide treeless space them, running great circle bending away either hand. Beyond deep fosse lost soft shadow, grass upon brink green, glowed still memory sun gone. Upon side rose great height green wall encircling green hill thronged mallorn-trees taller yet seen land. Their height could guessed, stood twilight like living towers. In many-tiered branches amid ever-moving leaves countless lights gleaming, green gold silver. Haldir turned towards Company. ‘Welcome Caras Galadhon!’ said. ‘Here city Galadhrim dwell Lord Celeborn Galadriel Lady Lo´rien. But cannot enter here, gates look northward. We must go round southern side, way short, city great.’ There road paved white stone running outer brink fosse. Along went westward, city ever climbing like green cloud upon left; night deepened lights sprang forth, hill seemed afire stars. They came last white bridge, crossing found great gates city: faced south-west, set ends encircling wall overlapped, tall strong, hung many lamps. Haldir knocked spoke, gates opened soundlessly; guards Frodo could see sign. The travellers passed within, gates shut behind them. They deep lane ends wall, passing quickly entered City Trees. No folk could see, hear feet upon paths; many voices, them, air above. Far away hill could hear sound singing falling high like soft rain upon leaves. They went along many paths climbed many stairs, came high places saw amid wide lawn fountain shimmering. It lit silver lamps swung boughs trees, fell basin silver, white stream spilled. Upon south side lawn stood mightiest trees; great smooth bole gleamed like grey silk, towered, first branches, far above, opened huge limbs shadowy clouds leaves. Beside broad white ladder stood, foot three Elves seated. They sprang travellers approached, Frodo saw tall clad grey mail, shoulders hung long white cloaks. ‘Here dwell Celeborn Galadriel,’ said Haldir. ‘It wish ascend speak them.’ One Elf-wardens blew clear note small horn, answered three times far above. ‘I go first,’ said Haldir. ‘Let Frodo come next Legolas. The others may follow wish. It long climb accustomed stairs, may rest upon way.’ As climbed slowly Frodo passed many flets: one side, another, set bole tree, ladder passed them. At great height ground came wide talan, like deck great ship. On built house, large almost would served hall Men upon earth. He entered behind Haldir, found chamber oval shape, midst grew trunk great mallorn, tapering towards crown, yet making still pillar wide girth. The chamber filled soft light; walls green silver roof gold. Many Elves seated there. On two chairs beneath bole tree canopied living bough sat, side side, Celeborn Galadriel. They stood greet guests, manner Elves, even accounted mighty kings. Very tall were, Lady less tall Lord; grave beautiful. They clad wholly white; hair Lady deep gold, hair Lord Celeborn silver long bright; sign age upon them, unless depths eyes; keen lances starlight, yet profound, wells deep memory. Haldir led Frodo them, Lord welcomed tongue. The Lady Galadriel said word looked long upon face. ‘Sit beside chair, Frodo Shire!’ said Celeborn. ‘When come speak together.’ Each companions greeted courteously name entered. ‘Welcome Aragorn son Arathorn!’ said. ‘It eight thirty years world outside since came land; years lie heavy you. But end near, good ill. Here lay aside burden while!’ ‘Welcome son Thranduil! Too seldom kindred journey hither North.’ ‘Welcome Gimli son Glo´in! It long indeed since saw one Durin’s folk Caras Galadhon. But today broken long law. May sign though world dark better days hand, friendship shall renewed peoples.’ Gimli bowed low. When guests seated chair Lord looked again. ‘Here eight,’ said. ‘Nine set out: said messages. But maybe change counsel heard. Elrond far away, darkness gathers us, year shadows grown longer.’ ‘Nay, change counsel,’ said Lady Galadriel, speaking first time. Her voice clear musical, deeper woman’s wont. ‘Gandalf Grey set Company, pass borders land. Now tell us is; I much desired speak again. But I cannot see afar, unless comes within fences Lothlo´rien: grey mist him, ways feet mind hidden me.’ ‘Alas!’ said Aragorn. ‘Gandalf Grey fell shadow. He remained Moria escape.’ At words Elves hall cried aloud grief amazement. ‘These evil tidings,’ said Celeborn, ‘the evil spoken long years full grievous deeds.’ He turned Haldir. ‘Why nothing told before?’ asked elven-tongue. ‘We spoken Haldir deeds purpose,’ said Legolas. ‘At first weary danger close behind; afterwards almost forgot grief time, walked gladness fair paths Lo´rien.’ ‘Yet grief great loss cannot mended,’ said Frodo. ‘Gandalf guide, led us Moria; escape seemed beyond hope saved us, fell.’ ‘Tell us full tale!’ said Celeborn. Then Aragorn recounted happened upon pass Caradhras, days followed; spoke Balin book, fight Chamber Mazarbul, fire, narrow bridge, coming Terror. ‘An evil Ancient World seemed, I never seen before,’ said Aragorn. ‘It shadow flame, strong terrible.’ ‘It Balrog Morgoth,’ said Legolas; ‘of elf-banes deadly, save One sits Dark Tower.’ ‘Indeed I saw upon bridge haunts darkest dreams, I saw Durin’s Bane,’ said Gimli low voice, dread eyes. ‘Alas!’ said Celeborn. ‘We long feared Caradhras terror slept. But I known Dwarves stirred evil Moria again, I would forbidden pass northern borders, went you. And possible, one would say last Gandalf fell wisdom folly, going needlessly net Moria.’ ‘He would rash indeed said thing,’ said Galadriel gravely. ‘Needless none deeds Gandalf life. Those followed knew mind cannot report full purpose. But however may guide, followers blameless. Do repent welcome Dwarf. If folk exiled long far Lothlo´rien, Galadhrim, even Celeborn Wise, would pass nigh would wish look upon ancient home, though become abode dragons? ‘Dark water Kheled-zaˆram, cold springs Kibil-naˆla, fair many-pillared halls Khazad-duˆm Elder Days fall mighty kings beneath stone.’ She looked upon Gimli, sat glowering sad, smiled. And Dwarf, hearing names given ancient tongue, looked met eyes; seemed looked suddenly heart enemy saw love understanding. Wonder came face, smiled answer. He rose clumsily bowed dwarf-fashion, saying: ‘Yet fair living land Lo´rien, Lady Galadriel jewels lie beneath earth!’ There silence. At length Celeborn spoke again. ‘I know plight evil,’ said. ‘Let Gimli forget harsh words: I spoke trouble heart. I I aid you, according wish need, especially one little folk bears burden.’ ‘Your quest known us,’ said Galadriel, looking Frodo. ‘But speak openly. Yet vain prove, maybe, came land seeking aid, Gandalf plainly purposed. For Lord Galadhrim accounted wisest Elves Middleearth, giver gifts beyond power kings. He dwelt West since days dawn, I dwelt years uncounted; ere fall Nargothrond Gondolin I passed mountains, together ages world fought long defeat. ‘I first summoned White Council. And designs gone amiss, would governed Gandalf Grey, mayhap things would gone otherwise. But even hope left. I give counsel, saying this, that. For contriving, choosing course another, I avail; knowing is, part also shall be. But I say you: Quest stands upon edge knife. Stray little fail, ruin all. Yet hope remains Company true.’ And word held eyes, silence looked searchingly turn. None save Legolas Aragorn could long endure glance. Sam quickly blushed hung head. At length Lady Galadriel released eyes, smiled. ‘Do let hearts troubled,’ said. ‘Tonight shall sleep peace.’ Then sighed felt suddenly weary, questioned long deeply, though words spoken openly. ‘Go now!’ said Celeborn. ‘You worn sorrow much toil. Even Quest concern us closely, refuge City, healed refreshed. Now shall rest, speak road while.’ That night Company slept upon ground, much satisfaction hobbits. The Elves spread pavilion among trees near fountain, laid soft couches; speaking words peace fair Elvish voices left them. For little travellers talked night tree-tops, day’s journey, Lord Lady; yet heart look back. ‘What blush for, Sam?’ said Pippin. ‘You soon broke down. Anyone would thought guilty conscience. I hope nothing worse wicked plot steal one blankets.’ ‘I never thought thing,’ answered Sam, mood jest. ‘If want know, I felt I hadn’t got nothing on, I didn’t like it. She seemed looking inside asking I would gave chance flying back home Shire nice little hole – bit garden own.’ ‘That’s funny,’ said Merry. ‘Almost exactly I felt myself; only, well, I don’t think I’ll say more,’ ended lamely. All them, seemed, fared alike: felt offered choice shadow full fear lay ahead, something greatly desired: clear mind lay, get turn aside road leave Quest war Sauron others. ‘And seemed me, too,’ said Gimli, ‘that choice would remain secret known myself.’ ‘To seemed exceedingly strange,’ said Boromir. ‘Maybe test, thought read thoughts good purpose; almost I said tempting us, offering pretended power give. It need said I refused listen. The Men Minas Tirith true word.’ But thought Lady offered Boromir tell. And Frodo, would speak, though Boromir pressed questions. ‘She held long gaze, Ring-bearer,’ said. ‘Yes,’ said Frodo; ‘but whatever came mind I keep there.’ ‘Well, care!’ said Boromir. ‘I feel sure Elvish Lady purposes.’ ‘Speak evil Lady Galadriel!’ said Aragorn sternly. ‘You know say. There land evil, unless man bring hither himself. Then let beware! But tonight I shall sleep without fear first time since I left Rivendell. And may I sleep deep, forget grief! I weary body heart.’ He cast upon couch fell long sleep. The others soon same, sound dream disturbed slumber. When woke found light day broad upon lawn pavilion, fountain rose fell glittering sun. They remained days Lothlo´rien, far could tell remember. All dwelt sun shone clear, save gentle rain fell times, passed away leaving things fresh clean. The air cool soft, early spring, yet felt deep thoughtful quiet winter. It seemed little eat drink rest, walk among trees; enough. They seen Lord Lady again, little speech Elven-folk; knew would use Westron tongue. Haldir bidden farewell gone back fences North, great watch kept since tidings Moria Company brought. Legolas away much among Galadhrim, first night sleep companions, though returned eat talk them. Often took Gimli went abroad land, others wondered change. Now companions sat walked together spoke Gandalf, known seen came clear minds. As healed hurt weariness body grief loss grew keen. Often heard nearby Elvish voices singing, knew making songs lamentation fall, caught name among sweet sad words could understand. Mithrandir, Mithrandir sang Elves, O Pilgrim Grey! For loved call him. But Legolas Company, would interpret songs them, saying skill, grief still near, matter tears yet song. It Frodo first put something sorrow halting words. He seldom moved make song rhyme; even Rivendell listened sung himself, though memory stored many things others made him. But sat beside fountain Lo´rien heard voices Elves, thought took shape song seemed fair him; yet tried repeat Sam snatches remained, faded handful withered leaves. When evening Shire grey footsteps Hill heard; dawn went away journey long without word. From Wilderland Western shore, northern waste southern hill, dragon-lair hidden door darkling woods walked will. With Dwarf Hobbit, Elves Men, mortal immortal folk, bird bough beast den, secret tongues spoke. A deadly sword, healing hand, back bent beneath load; trumpet-voice, burning brand, weary pilgrim road. A lord wisdom throned sat, swift anger, quick laugh; old man battered hat leaned upon thorny staff. He stood upon bridge alone Fire Shadow defied; staff broken stone, Khazad-duˆm wisdom died. ‘Why, you’ll beating Mr. Bilbo next!’ said Sam. ‘No, I afraid not,’ said Frodo. ‘But best I yet.’ ‘Well, Mr. Frodo, another go, I hope you’ll say word fireworks,’ said Sam. ‘Something like this: The finest rockets ever seen: burst stars blue green, thunder golden showers came falling like rain flowers. Though doesn’t justice long road.’ ‘No, I’ll leave you, Sam. Or perhaps Bilbo. But – well, I can’t talk more. I can’t bear think bringing news him.’ One evening Frodo Sam walking together cool twilight. Both felt restless again. On Frodo suddenly shadow parting fallen: knew somehow time near must leave Lothlo´rien. ‘What think Elves now, Sam?’ said. ‘I asked question – seems long ago; seen since then.’ ‘I indeed!’ said Sam. ‘And I reckon there’s Elves Elves. They’re Elvish enough, they’re same. Now folk aren’t wanderers homeless, seem bit nearer likes us: seem belong here, even Hobbits Shire. Whether they’ve made land, land’s made them, it’s hard say, take meaning. It’s wonderfully quiet here. Nothing seems going on, nobody seems want to. If there’s magic about, it’s right deep, I can’t lay hands it, manner speaking.’ ‘You see feel everywhere,’ said Frodo. ‘Well,’ said Sam, ‘you can’t see nobody working it. No fireworks like poor old Gandalf used show. I wonder don’t see nothing Lord Lady days. I fancy could wonderful things, mind. I’d dearly love see Elf-magic, Mr. Frodo!’ ‘I wouldn’t,’ said Frodo. ‘I content. And I don’t miss Gandalf’s fireworks, bushy eyebrows, quick temper, voice.’ ‘You’re right,’ said Sam. ‘And don’t think I’m finding fault. I’ve often wanted see bit magic like tells old tales, I’ve never heard better land this. It’s like home holiday time, understand me. I don’t want leave. All same, I’m beginning feel we’ve got go on, we’d best get over. ‘It’s job that’s never started takes longest finish, old gaffer used say. And I don’t reckon folk much help us, magic no. It’s leave land shall miss Gandalf worse, I’m thinking.’ ‘I afraid that’s true, Sam,’ said Frodo. ‘Yet I hope much leave shall see Lady Elves again.’ Even spoke, saw, came answer words, Lady Galadriel approaching. Tall white fair walked beneath trees. She spoke word, beckoned them. Turning aside, led towards southern slopes hill Caras Galadhon, passing high green hedge came enclosed garden. No trees grew there, lay open sky. The evening star risen shining white fire western woods. Down long flight steps Lady went deep green hollow, ran murmuring silver stream issued fountain hill. At bottom, upon low pedestal carved like branching tree, stood basin silver, wide shallow, beside stood silver ewer. With water stream Galadriel filled basin brim, breathed it, water still spoke. ‘Here Mirror Galadriel,’ said. ‘I brought may look it, will.’ The air still, dell dark, Elflady beside tall pale. ‘What shall look for, shall see?’ asked Frodo, filled awe. ‘Many things I command Mirror reveal,’ answered, ‘and I show desire see. But Mirror also show things unbidden, often stranger profitable things wish behold. What see, leave Mirror free work, I cannot tell. For shows things were, things are, things yet may be. But sees, even wisest cannot always tell. Do wish look?’ Frodo answer. ‘And you?’ said, turning Sam. ‘For folk would call magic, I believe; though I understand clearly mean; seem use word deceits Enemy. But this, will, magic Galadriel. Did say wished see Elf-magic?’ ‘I did,’ said Sam, trembling little fear curiosity. ‘I’ll peep, Lady, you’re willing. ‘And I’d mind glimpse what’s going home,’ said aside Frodo. ‘It seems terrible long time I’ve away. But there, like I’ll see stars, something I won’t understand.’ ‘Like not,’ said Lady gentle laugh. ‘But come, shall look see may. Do touch water!’ Sam climbed foot pedestal leaned basin. The water looked hard dark. Stars reflected it. ‘There’s stars, I thought,’ said. Then gave low gasp, stars went out. As dark veil withdrawn, Mirror grew grey, clear. There sun shining, branches trees waving tossing wind. But Sam could make mind saw, light faded; thought saw Frodo pale face lying fast asleep great dark cliff. Then seemed see going along dim passage, climbing endless winding stair. It came suddenly looking urgently something, know. Like dream vision shifted went back, saw trees again. But time close, could see going on: waving wind, falling, crashing ground. ‘Hi!’ cried Sam outraged voice. ‘There’s Ted Sandyman a-cutting trees shouldn’t. They didn’t ought felled: it’s avenue beyond Mill shades road Bywater. I wish I could get Ted, I’d fell him!’ But Sam noticed Old Mill vanished, large red-brick building put stood. Lots folk busily work. There tall red chimney nearby. Black smoke seemed cloud surface Mirror. ‘There’s devilry work Shire,’ said. ‘Elrond knew wanted send Mr. Merry back.’ Then suddenly Sam gave cry sprang away. ‘I can’t stay here,’ said wildly. ‘I must go home. They’ve dug Bagshot Row, there’s poor old Gaffer going Hill bits things barrow. I must go home!’ ‘You cannot go home alone,’ said Lady. ‘You wish go home without master looked Mirror, yet knew evil things might well happening Shire. Remember Mirror shows many things, yet come pass. Some never come be, unless behold visions turn aside path prevent them. The Mirror dangerous guide deeds.’ Sam sat ground put head hands. ‘I wish I never come here, I don’t want see magic,’ said fell silent. After moment spoke thickly, struggling tears. ‘No, I’ll go home long road Mr. Frodo, all,’ said. ‘But I hope I get back day. If I’ve seen turns true, somebody’s going catch hot!’ ‘Do wish look, Frodo?’ said Lady Galadriel. ‘You wish see Elf-magic content.’ ‘Do advise look?’ asked Frodo. ‘No,’ said. ‘I counsel one way other. I counsellor. You may learn something, whether see fair evil, may profitable, yet may not. Seeing good perilous. Yet I think, Frodo, courage wisdom enough venture, I would brought here. Do will!’ ‘I look,’ said Frodo, climbed pedestal bent dark water. At Mirror cleared saw twilit land. Mountains loomed dark distance pale sky. A long grey road wound back sight. Far away figure came slowly road, faint small first, growing larger clearer approached. Suddenly Frodo realized reminded Gandalf. He almost called aloud wizard’s name, saw figure clothed grey white, white shone faintly dusk; hand white staff. The head bowed could see face, presently figure turned aside round bend road went Mirror’s view. Doubt came Frodo’s mind: vision Gandalf one many lonely journeys long ago, Saruman? The vision changed. Brief small vivid caught glimpse Bilbo walking restlessly room. The table littered disordered papers; rain beating windows. Then pause, many swift scenes followed Frodo way knew parts great history become involved. The mist cleared saw sight never seen knew once: Sea. Darkness fell. The sea rose raged great storm. Then saw Sun, sinking blood-red wrack clouds, black outline tall ship torn sails riding West. Then wide river flowing populous city. Then white fortress seven towers. And ship black sails, morning again, water rippled light, banner bearing emblem white tree shone sun. A smoke fire battle arose, sun went burning red faded grey mist; mist small ship passed away, twinkling lights. It vanished, Frodo sighed prepared draw away. But suddenly Mirror went altogether dark, dark hole opened world sight, Frodo looked emptiness. In black abyss appeared single Eye slowly grew, filled nearly Mirror. So terrible Frodo stood rooted, unable cry withdraw gaze. The Eye rimmed fire, glazed, yellow cat’s, watchful intent, black slit pupil opened pit, window nothing. Then Eye began rove, searching way that; Frodo knew certainty horror among many things sought one. But also knew could see – yet, unless willed it. The Ring hung upon chain neck grew heavy, heavier great stone, head dragged downwards. The Mirror seemed growing hot curls steam rising water. He slipping forward. ‘Do touch water!’ said Lady Galadriel softly. The vision faded, Frodo found looking cool stars twinkling silver basin. He stepped back shaking looked Lady. ‘I know last saw,’ said; ‘for also mind. Do afraid! But think singing amid trees, even slender arrows elven-bows, land Lothlo´rien maintained defended Enemy. I say you, Frodo, even I speak you, I perceive Dark Lord know mind, mind concerns Elves. And gropes ever see thought. But still door closed!’ She lifted white arms, spread hands towards East gesture rejection denial. Ea¨rendil, Evening Star, beloved Elves, shone clear above. So bright figure Elven-lady cast dim shadow ground. Its rays glanced upon ring finger; glittered like polished gold overlaid silver light, white stone twinkled Evenstar come rest upon hand. Frodo gazed ring awe; suddenly seemed understood. ‘Yes,’ said, divining thought, ‘it permitted speak it, Elrond could so. But cannot hidden Ring-bearer, one seen Eye. Verily land Lo´rien upon finger Galadriel one Three remains. This Nenya, Ring Adamant, I keeper. ‘He suspects, know – yet. Do see wherefore coming us footstep Doom? For fail, laid bare Enemy. Yet succeed, power diminished, Lothlo´rien fade, tides Time sweep away. We must depart West, dwindle rustic folk dell cave, slowly forget forgotten.’ Frodo bent head. ‘And wish?’ said last. ‘That shall be,’ answered. ‘The love Elves land works deeper deeps Sea, regret undying cannot ever wholly assuaged. Yet cast away rather submit Sauron: know now. For fate Lothlo´rien answerable, task. Yet I could wish, avail, One Ring never wrought, remained ever lost.’ ‘You wise fearless fair, Lady Galadriel,’ said Frodo. ‘I give One Ring, ask it. It great matter me.’ Galadriel laughed sudden clear laugh. ‘Wise Lady Galadriel may be,’ said, ‘yet met match courtesy. Gently revenged testing heart first meeting. You begin see keen eye. I deny heart greatly desired ask offer. For many long years I pondered I might do, Great Ring come hands, behold! brought within grasp. The evil devised long ago works many ways, whether Sauron stands falls. Would noble deed set credit Ring, I taken force fear guest? ‘And last comes. You give Ring freely! In place Dark Lord set Queen. And I shall dark, beautiful terrible Morning Night! Fair Sea Sun Snow upon Mountain! Dreadful Storm Lightning! Stronger foundations earth. All shall love despair!’ She lifted hand ring wore issued great light illumined alone left else dark. She stood Frodo seeming tall beyond measurement, beautiful beyond enduring, terrible worshipful. Then let hand fall, light faded, suddenly laughed again, lo! shrunken: slender elf-woman, clad simple white, whose gentle voice soft sad. ‘I pass test,’ said. ‘I diminish, go West, remain Galadriel.’ They stood long silence. At length Lady spoke again. ‘Let us return!’ said. ‘In morning must depart, chosen, tides fate flowing.’ ‘I would ask one thing go,’ said Frodo, ‘a thing I often meant ask Gandalf Rivendell. I permitted wear One Ring: cannot I see others know thoughts wear them?’ ‘You tried,’ said. ‘Only thrice set Ring upon finger since knew possessed. Do try! It would destroy you. Did Gandalf tell rings give power according measure possessor? Before could use power would need become far stronger, train domination others. Yet even so, Ring-bearer one borne finger seen hidden, sight grown keener. You perceived thought clearly many accounted wise. You saw Eye holds Seven Nine. And see recognize ring upon finger? Did see ring?’ asked turning Sam. ‘No, Lady,’ answered. ‘To tell truth, I wondered talking about. I saw star fingers. But you’ll pardon speaking out, I think master right. I wish you’d take Ring. You’d put things rights. You’d stop digging Gaffer turning adrift. You’d make folk pay dirty work.’ ‘I would,’ said. ‘That would begin. But would stop that, alas! We speak it. Let us go!’ Chapter 8 FAREWELL TO LO´ RIEN That night Company summoned chamber Celeborn, Lord Lady greeted fair words. At length Celeborn spoke departure. ‘Now time,’ said, ‘when wish continue Quest must harden hearts leave land. Those longer wish go forward may remain here, while. But whether stay go, none sure peace. For come edge doom. Here wish may await oncoming hour till either ways world lie open again, summon last need Lo´rien. Then may return lands, else go long home fall battle.’ There silence. ‘They resolved go forward,’ said Galadriel looking eyes. ‘As me,’ said Boromir, ‘my way home lies onward back.’ ‘That true,’ said Celeborn, ‘but Company going Minas Tirith?’ ‘We decided course,’ said Aragorn. ‘Beyond Lothlo´rien I know Gandalf intended do. Indeed I think even clear purpose.’ ‘Maybe not,’ said Celeborn, ‘yet leave land, longer forget Great River. As know well, cannot crossed travellers baggage Lo´rien Gondor, save boat. And bridges Osgiliath broken landings held Enemy? ‘On side journey? The way Minas Tirith lies upon side, upon west; straight road Quest lies east River, upon darker shore. Which shore take?’ ‘If advice heeded, western shore, way Minas Tirith,’ answered Boromir. ‘But I leader Company.’ The others said nothing, Aragorn looked doubtful troubled. ‘I see yet know do,’ said Celeborn. ‘It part choose you; I help I may. There among handle boats: Legolas, whose folk know swift Forest River; Boromir Gondor; Aragorn traveller.’ ‘And one Hobbit!’ cried Merry. ‘Not us look boats wild horses. My people live banks Brandywine.’ ‘That well,’ said Celeborn. ‘Then I furnish Company boats. They must small light, go far water, places forced carry them. You come rapids Sarn Gebir, maybe last great falls Rauros River thunders Nen Hithoel; perils. Boats may make journey less toilsome while. Yet give counsel: end must leave River, turn west – east.’ Aragorn thanked Celeborn many times. The gift boats comforted much, least would need decide course days. The others, too, looked hopeful. Whatever perils lay ahead, seemed better float broad tide Anduin meet plod forward bent backs. Only Sam doubtful: rate still thought boats bad wild horses, worse, dangers survived made think better them. ‘All shall prepared await noon tomorrow,’ said Celeborn. ‘I send people morning help make ready journey. Now wish fair night untroubled sleep.’ ‘Good night, friends!’ said Galadriel. ‘Sleep peace! Do trouble hearts overmuch thought road tonight. Maybe paths shall tread already laid feet, though see them. Good night!’ The Company took leave returned pavilion. Legolas went them, last night Lothlo´rien, spite words Galadriel wished take counsel together. For long time debated do, would best attempt fulfilling purpose Ring; came decision. It plain desired go first Minas Tirith, escape least terror Enemy. They would willing follow leader River shadow Mordor; Frodo spoke word, Aragorn still divided mind. His plan, Gandalf remained them, go Boromir, sword help deliver Gondor. For believed message dreams summons, hour come last heir Elendil come forth strive Sauron mastery. But Moria burden Gandalf laid him; knew could forsake Ring, Frodo refused end go Boromir. And yet help could Company give Frodo, save walk blindly darkness? ‘I shall go Minas Tirith, alone need be, duty,’ said Boromir; silent while, sitting eyes fixed Frodo, trying read Halfling’s thoughts. At length spoke again, softly, debating himself. ‘If wish destroy Ring,’ said, ‘then little use war weapons; Men Minas Tirith cannot help. But wish destroy armed might Dark Lord, folly go without force domain; folly throw away.’ He paused suddenly, become aware speaking thoughts aloud. ‘It would folly throw lives away, I mean,’ ended. ‘It choice defending strong place walking openly arms death. At least, I see it.’ Frodo caught something new strange Boromir’s glance, looked hard him. Plainly Boromir’s thought different final words. It would folly throw away: what? The Ring Power? He said something like Council, accepted correction Elrond. Frodo looked Aragorn, seemed deep thought made sign heeded Boromir’s words. And debate ended. Merry Pippin already asleep, Sam nodding. The night growing old. In morning, beginning pack slender goods, Elves could speak tongue came brought many gifts food clothing journey. The food mostly form thin cakes, made meal baked light brown outside, inside colour cream. Gimli took one cakes looked doubtful eye. ‘Cram,’ said breath, broke crisp corner nibbled it. His expression quickly changed, ate rest cake relish. ‘No more, more!’ cried Elves laughing. ‘You eaten enough already long day’s march.’ ‘I thought kind cram, Dale-men make journeys wild,’ said Dwarf. ‘So is,’ answered. ‘But call lembas waybread, strengthening food made Men, pleasant cram, accounts.’ ‘Indeed is,’ said Gimli. ‘Why, better honeycakes Beornings, great praise, Beornings best bakers I know of; none willing deal cakes travellers days. You kindly hosts!’ ‘All same, bid spare food,’ said. ‘Eat little time, need. For things given serve else fails. The cakes keep sweet many many days, unbroken left leaf-wrappings, brought them. One keep traveller feet day long labour, even one tall Men Minas Tirith.’ The Elves next unwrapped gave Company clothes brought. For provided hood cloak, made according size, light warm silken stuff Galadhrim wove. It hard say colour were: grey hue twilight trees seemed be; yet moved, set another light, green shadowed leaves, brown fallow fields night, dusksilver water stars. Each cloak fastened neck brooch like green leaf veined silver. ‘Are magic cloaks?’ asked Pippin, looking wonder. ‘I know mean that,’ answered leader Elves. ‘They fair garments, web good, made land. They Elvish robes certainly, mean. Leaf branch, water stone: hue beauty things twilight Lo´rien love; put thought love make. Yet garments, armour, turn shaft blade. But serve well: light wear, warm enough cool enough need. And find great aid keeping sight unfriendly eyes, whether walk among stones trees. You indeed high favour Lady! For maidens wove stuff; never clad strangers garb people.’ After morning meal Company said farewell lawn fountain. Their hearts heavy; fair place, become like home them, though could count days nights passed there. As stood moment looking white water sunlight, Haldir came walking towards green grass glade. Frodo greeted delight. ‘I returned Northern Fences,’ said Elf, ‘and I sent guide again. The Dimrill Dale full vapour clouds smoke, mountains troubled. There noises deeps earth. If thought returning northwards homes, would able pass way. But come! Your path goes south.’ As walked Caras Galadhon green ways empty; trees many voices murmuring singing. They went silently. At last Haldir led southward slopes hill, came great gate hung lamps, white bridge; passed left city Elves. Then turned away paved road took path went deep thicket mallorntrees, passed on, winding rolling woodlands silver shadow, leading ever down, southwards eastwards, towards shores River. They gone ten miles noon hand came high green wall. Passing opening came suddenly trees. Before lay long lawn shining grass, studded golden elanor glinted sun. The lawn ran narrow tongue bright margins: right west Silverlode flowed glittering; left east Great River rolled broad waters, deep dark. On shores woodlands still marched southwards far eye could see, banks bleak bare. No mallorn lifted gold-hung boughs beyond Land Lo´rien. On bank Silverlode, distance meeting streams, hythe white stones white wood. By moored many boats barges. Some brightly painted, shone silver gold green, either white grey. Three small grey boats made ready travellers, Elves stowed goods. And added also coils rope, three boat. Slender looked, strong, silken touch, grey hue like elven-cloaks. ‘What these?’ asked Sam, handling one lay upon greensward. ‘Ropes indeed!’ answered Elf boats. ‘Never travel far without rope! And one long strong light. Such these. They may help many needs.’ ‘You don’t need tell that!’ said Sam. ‘I came without any, I’ve worried ever since. But I wondering made of, knowing bit rope-making: it’s family might say.’ ‘They made hithlain,’ said Elf, ‘but time instruct art making. Had known craft delighted you, could taught much. But alas! unless time return hither, must content gift. May serve well!’ ‘Come!’ said Haldir. ‘All ready you. Enter boats! But take care first!’ ‘Heed words!’ said Elves. ‘These boats light-built, crafty unlike boats folk. They sink, lade will; wayward mishandled. It would wise accustomed stepping out, landing-place, set downstream.’ The Company arranged way: Aragorn, Frodo, Sam one boat; Boromir, Merry, Pippin another; third Legolas Gimli, become fast friends. In last boat goods packs stowed. The boats moved steered short-handled paddles broad leaf-shaped blades. When ready Aragorn led trial Silverlode. The current swift went forward slowly. Sam sat bows, clutching sides, looking back wistfully shore. The sunlight glittering water dazzled eyes. As passed beyond green field Tongue, trees drew river’s brink. Here golden leaves tossed floated rippling stream. The air bright still, silence, except high distant song larks. They turned sharp bend river, there, sailing proudly stream towards them, saw swan great size. The water rippled either side white breast beneath curving neck. Its beak shone like burnished gold, eyes glinted like jet set yellow stones; huge white wings half lifted. A music came river drew nearer; suddenly perceived ship, wrought carved elven-skill likeness bird. Two elves clad white steered black paddles. In midst vessel sat Celeborn, behind stood Galadriel, tall white; circlet golden flowers hair, hand held harp, sang. Sad sweet sound voice cool clear air: I sang leaves, leaves gold, leaves gold grew: Of wind I sang, wind came branches blew. Beyond Sun, beyond Moon, foam Sea, And strand Ilmarin grew golden Tree. Beneath stars Ever-eve Eldamar shone, In Eldamar beside walls Elven Tirion. There long golden leaves grown upon branching years, While beyond Sundering Seas fall Elventears. O Lo´rien! The Winter comes, bare leafless Day; The leaves falling stream, River flows away. O Lo´rien! Too long I dwelt upon Hither Shore And fading crown twined golden elanor. But ships I sing, ship would come me, What ship would bear ever back across wide Sea? Aragorn stayed boat Swan-ship drew alongside. The Lady ended song greeted them. ‘We come bid last farewell,’ said, ‘and speed blessings land.’ ‘Though guests,’ said Celeborn, ‘you yet eaten us, bid you, therefore, parting feast, flowing waters bear far Lo´rien.’ The Swan passed slowly hythe, turned boats followed it. There last end Egladil upon green grass parting feast held; Frodo ate drank little, heeding beauty Lady voice. She seemed longer perilous terrible, filled hidden power. Already seemed him, men later days Elves still times seen: present yet remote, living vision already left far behind flowing streams Time. After eaten drunk, sitting upon grass, Celeborn spoke journey, lifting hand pointed south woods beyond Tongue. ‘As go water,’ said, ‘you find trees fail, come barren country. There River flows stony vales amid high moors, last many leagues comes tall island Tindrock, call Tol Brandir. There casts arms steep shores isle, falls great noise smoke cataracts Rauros Nindalf, Wetwang called tongue. That wide region sluggish fen stream becomes tortuous much divided. There Entwash flows many mouths Forest Fangorn west. About stream, side Great River, lies Rohan. On side bleak hills Emyn Muil. The wind blows East there, look Dead Marshes Noman-lands Cirith Gorgor black gates Mordor. ‘Boromir, go seeking Minas Tirith, well leave Great River Rauros cross Entwash finds marshes. Yet go far stream, risk becoming entangled Forest Fangorn. That strange land, little known. But Boromir Aragorn doubtless need warning.’ ‘Indeed heard Fangorn Minas Tirith,’ said Boromir. ‘But I heard seems part old wives’ tales, tell children. All lies north Rohan us far away fancy wander freely there. Of old Fangorn lay upon borders realm; many lives men since us visited it, prove disprove legends come distant years. ‘I whiles Rohan, I never crossed northwards. When I sent messenger, I passed Gap skirts White Mountains, crossed Isen Greyflood Northerland. A long wearisome journey. Four hundred leagues I reckoned it, took many months; I lost horse Tharbad, fording Greyflood. After journey, road I trodden Company, I much doubt I shall find way Rohan, Fangorn too, need be.’ ‘Then I need say more,’ said Celeborn. ‘But despise lore come distant years; oft may chance old wives keep memory word things needful wise know.’ Now Galadriel rose grass, taking cup one maidens filled white mead gave Celeborn. ‘Now time drink cup farewell,’ said. ‘Drink, Lord Galadhrim! And let heart sad, though night must follow noon, already evening draweth nigh.’ Then brought cup Company, bade drink farewell. But drunk commanded sit grass, chairs set Celeborn. Her maidens stood silent her, looked upon guests. At last spoke again. ‘We drunk cup parting,’ said, ‘and shadows fall us. But go, I brought ship gifts Lord Lady Galadhrim offer memory Lothlo´rien.’ Then called turn. ‘Here gift Celeborn Galadriel leader Company,’ said Aragorn, gave sheath made fit sword. It overlaid tracery flowers leaves wrought silver gold, set elven-runes formed many gems name Andu´ril lineage sword. ‘The blade drawn sheath shall stained broken even defeat,’ said. ‘But aught else desire parting? For darkness flow us, may shall meet again, unless far hence upon road returning.’ And Aragorn answered: ‘Lady, know desire, long held keeping treasure I seek. Yet give me, even would; darkness shall I come it.’ ‘Yet maybe lighten heart,’ said Galadriel; ‘for left care given you, pass land.’ Then lifted lap great stone clear green, set silver brooch wrought likeness eagle outspread wings; held gem flashed like sun shining leaves spring. ‘This stone I gave Celebrı´an daughter, hers; comes token hope. In hour take name foretold you, Elessar, Elfstone House Elendil!’ Then Aragorn took stone pinned brooch upon breast, saw wondered; marked tall kingly stood, seemed many years toil fallen shoulders. ‘For gifts given I thank you,’ said, ‘O Lady Lo´rien sprung Celebrı´an Arwen Evenstar. What praise could I say more?’ The Lady bowed head, turned Boromir, gave belt gold; Merry Pippin gave small silver belts, clasp wrought like golden flower. To Legolas gave bow Galadhrim used, longer stouter bows Mirkwood, strung string elf-hair. With went quiver arrows. ‘For little gardener lover trees,’ said Sam, ‘I small gift.’ She put hand little box plain grey wood, unadorned save single silver rune upon lid. ‘Here set G Galadriel,’ said; ‘but also may stand garden tongue. In box earth orchard, blessing Galadriel still bestow upon it. It keep road, defend peril; keep see home last, perhaps may reward you. Though find barren laid waste, gardens Middle-earth bloom like garden, sprinkle earth there. Then may remember Galadriel, catch glimpse far Lo´rien, seen winter. For Spring Summer gone by, never seen earth save memory.’ Sam went red ears muttered something inaudible, clutched box bowed well could. ‘And gift would Dwarf ask Elves?’ said Galadriel, turning Gimli. ‘None, Lady,’ answered Gimli. ‘It enough seen Lady Galadhrim, heard gentle words.’ ‘Hear ye Elves!’ cried her. ‘Let none say Dwarves grasping ungracious! Yet surely, Gimli son Glo´in, desire something I could give? Name it, I bid you! You shall guest without gift.’ ‘There nothing, Lady Galadriel,’ said Gimli, bowing low stammering. ‘Nothing, unless might – unless permitted ask, nay, name single strand hair, surpasses gold earth stars surpass gems mine. I ask gift. But commanded name desire.’ The Elves stirred murmured astonishment, Celeborn gazed Dwarf wonder, Lady smiled. ‘It said skill Dwarves hands rather tongues,’ said; ‘yet true Gimli. For none ever made request bold yet courteous. And shall I refuse, since I commanded speak? But tell me, would gift?’ ‘Treasure it, Lady,’ answered, ‘in memory words first meeting. And ever I return smithies home, shall set imperishable crystal heirloom house, pledge good Mountain Wood end days.’ Then Lady unbraided one long tresses, cut three golden hairs, laid Gimli’s hand. ‘These words shall go gift,’ said. ‘I foretell, foretelling vain: one hand lies darkness, hope. But hope fail, I say you, Gimli son Glo´in, hands shall flow gold, yet gold shall dominion. ‘And you, Ring-bearer,’ said, turning Frodo. ‘I come last last thoughts. For I prepared this.’ She held small crystal phial: glittered moved it, rays white light sprang hand. ‘In phial,’ said, ‘is caught light Ea¨rendil’s star, set amid waters fountain. It shine still brighter night you. May light dark places, lights go out. Remember Galadriel Mirror!’ Frodo took phial, moment shone them, saw standing like queen, great beautiful, longer terrible. He bowed, found words say. Now Lady arose, Celeborn led back hythe. A yellow noon lay green land Tongue, water glittered silver. All last made ready. The Company took places boats before. Crying farewell, Elves Lo´rien long grey poles thrust flowing stream, rippling waters bore slowly away. The travellers sat still without moving speaking. On green bank near point Tongue Lady Galadriel stood alone silent. As passed turned eyes watched slowly floating away them. For seemed them: Lo´rien slipping backward, like bright ship masted enchanted trees, sailing forgotten shores, sat helpless upon margin grey leafless world. Even gazed, Silverlode passed currents Great River, boats turned began speed southward. Soon white form Lady small distant. She shone like window glass upon far hill westering sun, remote lake seen mountain: crystal fallen lap land. Then seemed Frodo lifted arms final farewell, far piercing-clear following wind came sound voice singing. But sang ancient tongue Elves beyond Sea, understand words: fair music, comfort him. Yet way Elvish words, remained graven memory, long afterwards interpreted them, well could: language Elven-song spoke things little known Middle-earth. Ai! laurie¨ lantar lassi su´rinen, ye´ni u´no´time¨ ra´mar aldaron!

Suddenly River swept round bend, banks rose upon either side, light Lo´rien hidden. To fair land Frodo never came again. The travellers turned faces journey; sun them, eyes dazzled, filled tears. Gimli wept openly. ‘I looked last upon fairest,’ said Legolas companion. ‘Henceforward I call nothing fair, unless gift.’ He put hand breast. ‘Tell me, Legolas, I come Quest? Little I know chief peril lay! Truly Elrond spoke, saying could foresee might meet upon road. Torment dark danger I feared, hold back. But I would come, I known danger light joy. Now I taken worst wound parting, even I go night straight Dark Lord. Alas Gimli son Glo´in!’ ‘Nay!’ said Legolas. ‘Alas us all! And walk world after-days. For way it: find lose, seems whose boat running stream. But I count blessed, Gimli son Glo´in: loss suffer free will, might chosen otherwise. But forsaken companions, least reward shall memory Lothlo´rien shall remain ever clear unstained heart, shall neither fade grow stale.’ ‘Maybe,’ said Gimli; ‘and I thank words. True words doubtless; yet comfort cold. Memory heart desires. That mirror, clear Kheled-zaˆram. Or says heart Gimli Dwarf. Elves may see things otherwise. Indeed I heard memory like waking world dream. Not Dwarves. ‘But let us talk it. Look boat! She low water baggage, Great River swift. I wish drown grief cold water.’ He took paddle, steered towards western bank, following Aragorn’s boat ahead, already moved middle stream. So Company went long way, wide hurrying waters, borne ever southwards. Bare woods stalked along either bank, could see glimpse lands behind. The breeze died away River flowed without sound. No voice bird broke silence. The sun grew misty day grew old, gleamed pale sky like high white pearl. Then faded West, dusk came early, followed grey starless night. Far dark quiet hours floated on, guiding boats overhanging shadows western woods. Great trees passed like ghosts, thrusting twisted thirsty roots mist water. It dreary cold. Frodo sat listened faint lap gurgle River fretting among tree-roots driftwood near shore, head nodded fell uneasy sleep. Chapter 9 THE GREAT RIVER Frodo roused Sam. He found lying, well wrapped, tall grey-skinned trees quiet corner woodlands west bank Great River, Anduin. He slept night away, grey morning dim among bare branches. Gimli busy small fire near hand. They started day broad. Not Company eager hurry southwards: content decision, must make latest came Rauros Tindrock Isle, still lay days ahead; let River bear pace, desire hasten towards perils lay beyond, whichever course took end. Aragorn let drift stream wished, husbanding strength weariness come. But insisted least start early day journey far evening; felt heart time pressing, feared Dark Lord idle lingered Lo´rien. Nonetheless saw sign enemy day, next. The dull grey hours passed without event. As third day voyage wore lands changed slowly: trees thinned failed altogether. On eastern bank left saw long formless slopes stretching away towards sky; brown withered looked, fire passed them, leaving living blade green: unfriendly waste without even broken tree bold stone relieve emptiness. They come Brown Lands lay, vast desolate, Southern Mirkwood hills Emyn Muil. What pestilence war evil deed Enemy blasted region even Aragorn could tell. Upon west right land treeless also, flat, many places green wide plains grass. On side River passed forests great reeds, tall shut view west, little boats went rustling along fluttering borders. Their dark withered plumes bent tossed light cold airs, hissing softly sadly. Here openings Frodo could catch sudden glimpses rolling meads, far beyond hills sunset, away edge sight dark line, marched southernmost ranks Misty Mountains. There sign living moving things, save birds. Of many: small fowl whistling piping reeds, seldom seen. Once twice travellers heard rush whine swan-wings, looking saw great phalanx streaming along sky. ‘Swans!’ said Sam. ‘And mighty big ones too!’ ‘Yes,’ said Aragorn, ‘and black swans.’ ‘How wide empty mournful country looks!’ said Frodo. ‘I always imagined one journeyed south got warmer merrier, winter left behind ever.’ ‘But journeyed far south yet,’ answered Aragorn. ‘It still winter, far sea. Here world cold sudden spring, may yet snow again. Far away Bay Belfalas, Anduin runs, warm merry, maybe, would Enemy. But sixty leagues, I guess, south Southfarthing away Shire, hundreds long miles yonder. You looking south-west across north plains Riddermark, Rohan land Horse-lords. Ere long shall come mouth Limlight runs Fangorn join Great River. That north boundary Rohan; old lay Limlight White Mountains belonged Rohirrim. It rich pleasant land, grass rival; evil days folk dwell River ride often shores. Anduin wide, yet orcs shoot arrows far across stream; late, said, dared cross water raid herds studs Rohan.’ Sam looked bank bank uneasily. The trees seemed hostile before, harboured secret eyes lurking dangers; wished trees still there. He felt Company naked, afloat little open boats midst shelterless lands, river frontier war. In next day two, went on, borne steadily southwards, feeling insecurity grew Company. For whole day took paddles hastened forward. The banks slid by. Soon River broadened grew shallow; long stony beaches lay upon east, gravel-shoals water, careful steering needed. The Brown Lands rose bleak wolds, flowed chill air East. On side meads become rolling downs withered grass amidst land fen tussock. Frodo shivered, thinking lawns fountains, clear sun gentle rains Lothlo´rien. There little speech laughter boats. Each member Company busy thoughts. The heart Legolas running stars summer night northern glade amid beech-woods; Gimli fingering gold mind, wondering fit wrought housing Lady’s gift. Merry Pippin middle boat ill ease, Boromir sat muttering himself, sometimes biting nails, restlessness doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing paddle driving boat close behind Aragorn’s. Then Pippin, sat bow looking back, caught queer gleam eye, peered forward gazing Frodo. Sam long ago made mind that, though boats maybe dangerous brought believe, far uncomfortable even imagined. He cramped miserable, nothing stare winter-lands crawling grey water either side him. Even paddles use trust Sam one. As dusk drew fourth day, looking back bowed heads Frodo Aragorn following boats; drowsy longed camp feel earth toes. Suddenly something caught sight: first stared listlessly, sat rubbed eyes; looked could see more. That night camped small eyot close western bank. Sam lay rolled blankets beside Frodo. ‘I funny dream hour two stopped, Mr. Frodo,’ said. ‘Or maybe wasn’t dream. Funny anyway.’ ‘Well, it?’ said Frodo, knowing Sam would settle told tale, whatever was. ‘I haven’t seen thought anything make smile since left Lothlo´rien.’ ‘It wasn’t funny way, Mr. Frodo. It queer. All wrong, wasn’t dream. And best hear it. It like this: I saw log eyes!’ ‘The log’s right,’ said Frodo. ‘There many River. But leave eyes!’ ‘That I won’t,’ said Sam. ‘’Twas eyes made sit up, speak. I saw I took log floating along half-light behind Gimli’s boat; I didn’t give much heed it. Then seemed log slowly catching us up. And peculiar, might say, seeing floating stream together. Just I saw eyes: two pale sort points, shiny-like, hump near end log. What’s more, wasn’t log, paddle-feet, like swan’s almost, seemed bigger, kept dipping water. ‘That’s I sat right rubbed eyes, meaning give shout, still I rubbed drowse head. For whatever-it-was coming along fast getting close behind Gimli. But whether two lamps spotted moving staring, whether I came senses, I don’t know. When I looked again, wasn’t there. Yet I think I caught glimpse, tail eye, saying is, something dark shooting shadow bank. I couldn’t see eyes, though. ‘I said myself: ‘‘dreaming again, Sam Gamgee,’’ I said; I said then. But I’ve thinking since, I’m sure. What make it, Mr. Frodo?’ ‘I make nothing log dusk sleep eyes, Sam,’ said Frodo, ‘if first time eyes seen. But isn’t. I saw away back north reached Lo´rien. And I saw strange creature eyes climbing flet night. Haldir saw too. And remember report Elves went orc-band?’ ‘Ah,’ said Sam, ‘I do; I remember too. I don’t like thoughts; thinking one thing another, Mr. Bilbo’s stories all, I fancy I could put name creature, guess. A nasty name. Gollum, maybe?’ ‘Yes, I feared time,’ said Frodo. ‘Ever since night flet. I suppose lurking Moria, picked trail then; I hoped stay Lo´rien would throw scent again. The miserable creature must hiding woods Silverlode, watching us start off!’ ‘That’s it,’ said Sam. ‘And we’d better bit watchful ourselves, we’ll feel nasty fingers round necks one nights, ever wake feel anything. And that’s I leading to. No need trouble Strider others tonight. I’ll keep watch. I sleep tomorrow, luggage boat, might say.’ ‘I might,’ said Frodo, ‘and I might say ‘‘luggage eyes’’. You shall watch; promise wake half-way towards morning, nothing happens then.’ In dead hours Frodo came deep dark sleep find Sam shaking him. ‘It’s shame wake you,’ whispered Sam, ‘but that’s said. There’s nothing tell, much. I thought I heard soft plashing sniffing noise, back; hear lot queer sounds river night.’ He lay down, Frodo sat up, huddled blankets, fought sleep. Minutes hours passed slowly, nothing happened. Frodo yielding temptation lie dark shape, hardly visible, floated close one moored boats. A long whitish hand could dimly seen shot grabbed gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes shone coldly peered inside, lifted gazed Frodo eyot. They yard two away, Frodo heard soft hiss intaken breath. He stood up, drawing Sting sheath, faced eyes. Immediately light shut off. There another hiss splash, dark log-shape shot away downstream night. Aragorn stirred sleep, turned over, sat up. ‘What it?’ whispered, springing coming Frodo. ‘I felt something sleep. Why drawn sword?’ ‘Gollum,’ answered Frodo. ‘Or least, I guess.’ ‘Ah!’ said Aragorn. ‘So know little footpad, you? He padded us Moria right Nimrodel. Since took boats, lying log paddling hands feet. I tried catch twice night; slier fox, slippery fish. I hoped river-voyage would beat him, clever waterman. ‘We shall try going faster tomorrow. You lie now, I keep watch left night. I wish I could lay hands wretch. We might make useful. But I cannot, shall try lose him. He dangerous. Quite apart murder night account, may put enemy track.’ The night passed without Gollum showing much shadow again. After Company kept sharp look-out, saw Gollum voyage lasted. If still following, wary cunning. At Aragorn’s bidding paddled long spells, banks went swiftly by. But saw little country, journeyed mostly night twilight, resting day, lying hidden land allowed. In way time passed without event seventh day. The weather still grey overcast, wind East, evening drew night sky away westward cleared, pools faint light, yellow pale green, opened grey shores cloud. There white rind new Moon could seen glimmering remote lakes. Sam looked puckered brows. The next day country either side began change rapidly. The banks began rise grow stony. Soon passing hilly rocky land, shores steep slopes buried deep brakes thorn sloe, tangled brambles creepers. Behind stood low crumbling cliffs, chimneys grey weathered stone dark ivy; beyond rose high ridges crowned wind-writhen firs. They drawing near grey hill-country Emyn Muil, southern march Wilderland. There many birds cliffs rockchimneys, day high air flocks birds circling, black pale sky. As lay camp day Aragorn watched flights doubtfully, wondering Gollum mischief news voyage moving wilderness. Later sun setting, Company stirring getting ready start again, descried dark spot fading light: great bird high far off, wheeling, flying slowly southwards. ‘What that, Legolas?’ asked, pointing northern sky. ‘Is it, I think, eagle?’ ‘Yes,’ said Legolas. ‘It eagle, hunting eagle. I wonder forebodes. It far mountains.’ ‘We start fully dark,’ said Aragorn. The eighth night journey came. It silent windless; grey east wind passed away. The thin crescent Moon fallen early pale sunset, sky clear above, though far away South great ranges cloud still shone faintly, West stars glinted bright. ‘Come!’ said Aragorn. ‘We venture one journey night. We coming reaches River I know well; I never journeyed water parts before, rapids Sarn Gebir. But I right reckoning, still many miles ahead. Still dangerous places even come there: rocks stony eyots stream. We must keep sharp watch try paddle swiftly.’ To Sam leading boat given task watchman. He lay forward peering gloom. The night grew dark, stars strangely bright, glimmer face River. It close midnight, drifting while, hardly using paddles, suddenly Sam cried out. Only yards ahead dark shapes loomed stream heard swirl racing water. There swift current swung left, towards eastern shore channel clear. As swept aside travellers could see, close, pale foam River lashing sharp rocks thrust far stream like ridge teeth. The boats huddled together. ‘Hoy there, Aragorn!’ shouted Boromir, boat bumped leader. ‘This madness! We cannot dare Rapids night! But boat live Sarn Gebir, night day.’ ‘Back, back!’ cried Aragorn. ‘Turn! Turn can!’ He drove paddle water, trying hold boat bring round. ‘I reckoning,’ said Frodo. ‘I know come far: Anduin flows faster I thought. Sarn Gebir must close hand already.’ With great efforts checked boats slowly brought about; first could make small headway current, time carried nearer nearer eastern bank. Now dark ominous loomed night. ‘All together, paddle!’ shouted Boromir. ‘Paddle! Or shall driven shoals.’ Even spoke Frodo felt keel beneath grate upon stone. At moment twang bowstrings: several arrows whistled them, fell among them. One smote Frodo shoulders lurched forward cry, letting go paddle: arrow fell back, foiled hidden coat mail. Another passed Aragorn’s hood; third stood fast gunwale second boat, close Merry’s hand. Sam thought could glimpse black figures running fro upon long shingle-banks lay eastern shore. They seemed near. ‘Yrch!’ said Legolas, falling tongue. ‘Orcs!’ cried Gimli. ‘Gollum’s doing, I’ll bound,’ said Sam Frodo. ‘And nice place choose, too. The River seems set taking us right arms!’ They leaned forward straining paddles: even Sam took hand. Every moment expected feel bite black-feathered arrows. Many whined overhead struck water nearby; hits. It dark, dark night-eyes Orcs, starglimmer must offered cunning foes mark, unless grey cloaks Lo´rien grey timber elf-wrought boats defeated malice archers Mordor. Stroke stroke laboured on. In darkness hard sure indeed moving all; slowly swirl water grew less, shadow eastern bank faded back night. At last, far could judge, reached middle stream driven boats back distance jutting rocks. Then half turning thrust strength towards western shore. Under shadow bushes leaning water halted drew breath. Legolas laid paddle took bow brought Lo´rien. Then sprang ashore climbed paces bank. Stringing bow fitting arrow turned, peering back River darkness. Across water shrill cries, nothing could seen. Frodo looked Elf standing tall him, gazed night, seeking mark shoot at. His head dark, crowned sharp white stars glittered black pools sky behind. But rising sailing South great clouds advanced, sending dark outriders starry fields. A sudden dread fell Company. ‘Elbereth Gilthoniel!’ sighed Legolas looked up. Even so, dark shape, like cloud yet cloud, moved far swiftly, came blackness South, sped towards Company, blotting light approached. Soon appeared great winged creature, blacker pits night. Fierce voices rose greet across water. Frodo felt sudden chill running clutching heart; deadly cold, like memory old wound, shoulder. He crouched down, hide. Suddenly great bow Lo´rien sang. Shrill went arrow elven-string. Frodo looked up. Almost winged shape swerved. There harsh croaking scream, fell air, vanishing gloom eastern shore. The sky clean again. There tumult many voices far away, cursing wailing darkness, silence. Neither shaft cry came east night. After Aragorn led boats back upstream. They felt way along water’s edge distance, found small shallow bay. A low trees grew close water, behind rose steep rocky bank. Here Company decided stay await dawn: useless attempt move night. They made camp lit fire, lay huddled boats, moored close together. ‘Praised bow Galadriel, hand eye Legolas!’ said Gimli, munched wafer lembas. ‘That mighty shot dark, friend!’ ‘But say hit?’ said Legolas. ‘I cannot,’ said Gimli. ‘But I glad shadow came nearer. I liked all. Too much reminded shadow Moria – shadow Balrog,’ ended whisper. ‘It Balrog,’ said Frodo, still shivering chill come upon him. ‘It something colder. I think was——’ Then paused fell silent. ‘What think?’ asked Boromir eagerly, leaning boat, trying catch glimpse Frodo’s face. ‘I think—No, I say,’ answered Frodo. ‘Whatever was, fall dismayed enemies.’ ‘So seems,’ said Aragorn. ‘Yet are, many, next, know. This night must sleepless! Dark hides us now. But day show tell? Have weapons close hand!’ Sam sat tapping hilt sword counting fingers, looking sky. ‘It’s strange,’ murmured. ‘The Moon’s Shire Wilderland, ought be. But either it’s running, I’m wrong reckoning. You’ll remember, Mr. Frodo, Moon waning lay flet tree: week full, I reckon. And we’d week way last night, pops New Moon thin nail-paring, never stayed time Elvish country. ‘Well, I remember three nights certain, I seem remember several more, I would take oath never whole month. Anyone would think time count there!’ ‘And perhaps way it,’ said Frodo. ‘In land, maybe, time elsewhere long gone by. It not, I think, Silverlode bore us back Anduin returned time flows mortal lands Great Sea. And I don’t remember moon, either new old, Caras Galadhon: stars night sun day.’ Legolas stirred boat. ‘Nay, time tarry ever,’ said; ‘but change growth things places alike. For Elves world moves, moves swift slow. Swift, change little, else fleets by: grief them. Slow, need count running years, themselves. The passing seasons ripples ever repeated long long stream. Yet beneath Sun things must wear end last.’ ‘But wearing slow Lo´rien,’ said Frodo. ‘The power Lady it. Rich hours, though short seem, Caras Galadhon, Galadriel wields Elvenring.’ ‘That said outside Lo´rien, even me,’ said Aragorn. ‘Speak it! But is, Sam: land lost count. There time flowed swiftly us, Elves. The old moon passed, new moon waxed waned world outside, tarried there. And yestereve new moon came again. Winter nearly gone. Time flows spring little hope.’ The night passed silently. No voice call heard across water. The travellers huddled boats felt changing weather. The air grew warm still great moist clouds floated South distant seas. The rushing River rocks rapids seemed grow louder closer. The twigs trees began drip. When day came mood world become soft sad. Slowly dawn grew pale light, diffused shadowless. There mist River, white fog swathed shore; far bank could seen. ‘I can’t abide fog,’ said Sam; ‘but seems lucky one. Now perhaps get away without cursed goblins seeing us.’ ‘Perhaps so,’ said Aragorn. ‘But hard find path unless fog lifts little later on. And must find path, pass Sarn Gebir come Emyn Muil.’ ‘I see pass Rapids follow River further,’ said Boromir. ‘If Emyn Muil lie us, abandon cockle-boats, strike westward southward, come Entwash cross land.’ ‘We can, making Minas Tirith,’ said Aragorn, ‘but yet agreed. And course may perilous sounds. The vale Entwash flat fenny, fog deadly peril foot laden. I would abandon boats must. The River least path cannot missed.’ ‘But Enemy holds eastern bank,’ objected Boromir. ‘And even pass Gates Argonath come unmolested Tindrock, then? Leap Falls land marshes?’ ‘No!’ answered Aragorn. ‘Say rather bear boats ancient way Rauros-foot, take water again. Do know, Boromir, choose forget North Stair, high seat upon Amon Hen, made days great kings? I least mind stand high place again, I decide course. There, maybe, shall see sign guide us.’ Boromir held long choice; became plain Frodo would follow Aragorn, wherever went, gave in. ‘It way Men Minas Tirith desert friends need,’ said, ‘and need strength, ever reach Tindrock. To tall isle I go, further. There I shall turn home, alone help earned reward companionship.’ The day growing, fog lifted little. It decided Aragorn Legolas go forward along shore, others remained boats. Aragorn hoped find way could carry boats baggage smoother water beyond Rapids. ‘Boats Elves would sink, maybe,’ said, ‘but say come Sarn Gebir alive. None ever done yet. No road made Men Gondor region, even great days realm reach Anduin beyond Emyn Muil; portage-way somewhere western shore, I find it. It cannot yet perished; light boats used journey Wilderland Osgiliath, still years ago, Orcs Mordor began multiply.’ ‘Seldom life boat come North, Orcs prowl east-shore,’ said Boromir. ‘If go forward, peril grow every mile, even find path.’ ‘Peril lies ahead every southward road,’ answered Aragorn. ‘Wait us one day. If return time, know evil indeed befallen us. Then must take new leader follow best can.’ It heavy heart Frodo saw Aragorn Legolas climb steep bank vanish mists; fears proved groundless. Only two three hours passed, barely mid-day, shadowy shapes explorers appeared again. ‘All well,’ said Aragorn, clambered bank. ‘There track, leads good landing still serviceable. The distance great: head Rapids half mile us, little mile long. Not far beyond stream becomes clear smooth again, though runs swiftly. Our hardest task get boats baggage old portage-way. We found it, lies well back water-side here, runs lee rock-wall, furlong shore. We find northward landing lies. If still remains, must passed yesterday night. We might labour far upstream yet miss fog. I fear must leave River now, make portageway best here.’ ‘That would easy, even Men,’ said Boromir. ‘Yet try it,’ said Aragorn. ‘Aye, will,’ said Gimli. ‘The legs Men lag rough road, Dwarf goes on, burden twice weight, Master Boromir!’ The task proved hard indeed, yet end done. The goods taken boats brought top bank, level space. Then boats drawn water carried up. They far less heavy expected. Of tree growing Elvish country made even Legolas knew; wood tough yet strangely light. Merry Pippin alone could carry boat ease along flat. Nonetheless needed strength two Men lift haul ground Company cross. It sloped away River, tumbled waste grey limestone-boulders, many hidden holes shrouded weeds bushes; thickets brambles, sheer dells; boggy pools fed waters trickling terraces inland. One one Boromir Aragorn carried boats, others toiled scrambled baggage. At last removed laid portage-way. Then little hindrance, save sprawling briars many fallen stones, moved forward together. Fog still hung veils upon crumbling rock-wall, left mist shrouded River: could hear rushing foaming sharp shelves stony teeth Sarn Gebir, could see it. Twice made journey, brought safe southern landing. There portage-way, turning back water-side, ran gently shallow edge little pool. It seemed scooped river-side, hand, water swirling Sarn Gebir low pier rock jutted way stream. Beyond shore rose sheer grey cliff, passage foot. Already short afternoon past, dim cloudy dusk closing in. They sat beside water listening confused rush roar Rapids hidden mist; tired sleepy, hearts gloomy dying day. ‘Well, are, must pass another night,’ said Boromir. ‘We need sleep, even Aragorn mind pass Gates Argonath night, tired – except, doubt, sturdy dwarf.’ Gimli made reply: nodding sat. ‘Let us rest much now,’ said Aragorn. ‘Tomorrow must journey day again. Unless weather changes cheats us, shall good chance slipping through, unseen eyes eastern shore. But tonight two must watch together turns: three hours one guard.’ Nothing happened night worse brief drizzle rain hour dawn. As soon fully light started. Already fog thinning. They kept close could western side, could see dim shapes low cliffs rising ever higher, shadowy walls feet hurrying river. In mid-morning clouds drew lower, began rain heavily. They drew skin-covers boats prevent flooded, drifted on; little could seen grey falling curtains. The rain, however, last long. Slowly sky grew lighter, suddenly clouds broke, draggled fringes trailed away northward River. The fogs mists gone. Before travellers lay wide ravine, great rocky sides clung, upon shelves narrow crevices, thrawn trees. The channel grew narrower River swifter. Now speeding along little hope stopping turning, whatever might meet ahead. Over lane pale-blue sky, around dark overshadowed River, black, shutting sun, hills Emyn Muil, opening could seen. Frodo peering forward saw distance two great rocks approaching: like great pinnacles pillars stone seemed. Tall sheer ominous stood upon either side stream. A narrow gap appeared them, River swept boats towards it. ‘Behold Argonath, Pillars Kings!’ cried Aragorn. ‘We shall pass soon. Keep boats line, far apart can! Hold middle stream!’ As Frodo borne towards great pillars rose like towers meet him. Giants seemed him, vast grey figures silent threatening. Then saw indeed shaped fashioned: craft power old wrought upon them, still preserved suns rains forgotten years mighty likenesses hewn. Upon great pedestals founded deep waters stood two great kings stone: still blurred eyes crannied brows frowned upon North. The left hand raised palm outwards gesture warning; right hand axe; upon head crumbling helm crown. Great power majesty still wore, silent wardens long-vanished kingdom. Awe fear fell upon Frodo, cowered down, shutting eyes daring look boat drew near. Even Boromir bowed head boats whirled by, frail fleeting little leaves, enduring shadow sentinels Nu´menor. So passed dark chasm Gates. Sheer rose dreadful cliffs unguessed heights either side. Far dim sky. The black waters roared echoed, wind screamed them. Frodo crouching knees heard Sam front muttering groaning: ‘What place! What horrible place! Just let get boat, I’ll never wet toes puddle again, let alone river!’ ‘Fear not!’ said strange voice behind him. Frodo turned saw Strider, yet Strider; weatherworn Ranger longer there. In stern sat Aragorn son Arathorn, proud erect, guiding boat skilful strokes; hood cast back, dark hair blowing wind, light eyes: king returning exile land. ‘Fear not!’ said. ‘Long I desired look upon likenesses Isildur Ana´rion, sires old. Under shadow Elessar, Elfstone son Arathorn House Valandil Isildur’s son, heir Elendil, naught dread!’ Then light eyes faded, spoke himself: ‘Would Gandalf here! How heart yearns Minas Anor walls city! But whither shall I go?’ The chasm long dark, filled noise wind rushing water echoing stone. It bent somewhat towards west first dark ahead; soon Frodo saw tall gap light him, ever growing. Swiftly drew near, suddenly boats shot through, wide clear light. The sun, already long fallen noon, shining windy sky. The pent waters spread long oval lake, pale Nen Hithoel, fenced steep grey hills whose sides clad trees, heads bare, cold-gleaming sunlight. At far southern end rose three peaks. The midmost stood somewhat forward others sundered them, island waters, flowing River flung pale shimmering arms. Distant deep came wind roaring sound like roll thunder heard far away. ‘Behold Tol Brandir!’ said Aragorn, pointing south tall peak. ‘Upon left stands Amon Lhaw, upon right Amon Hen, Hills Hearing Sight. In days great kings high seats upon them, watch kept there. But said foot man beast ever set upon Tol Brandir. Ere shade night falls shall come them. I hear endless voice Rauros calling.’ The Company rested while, drifting south current flowed middle lake. They ate food, took paddles hastened way. The sides westward hills fell shadow, Sun grew round red. Here misty star peered out. The three peaks loomed them, darkling twilight. Rauros roaring great voice. Already night laid flowing waters travellers came last shadow hills. The tenth day journey over. Wilderland behind them. They could go without choice east-way west. The last stage Quest them. Chapter 10 THE BREAKING OF THE FELLOWSHIP Aragorn led right arm River. Here upon western side shadow Tol Brandir green lawn ran water feet Amon Hen. Behind rose first gentle slopes hill clad trees, trees marched away westward along curving shores lake. A little spring fell tumbling fed grass. ‘Here rest tonight,’ said Aragorn. ‘This lawn Parth Galen: fair place summer days old. Let us hope evil yet come here.’ They drew boats green banks, beside made camp. They set watch, sight sound enemies. If Gollum contrived follow them, remained unseen unheard. Nonetheless night wore Aragorn grew uneasy, tossing often sleep waking. In small hours got came Frodo, whose turn watch. ‘Why waking?’ asked Frodo. ‘It watch.’ ‘I know,’ answered Aragorn; ‘but shadow threat growing sleep. It would well draw sword.’ ‘Why?’ said Frodo. ‘Are enemies hand?’ ‘Let us see Sting may show,’ answered Aragorn. Frodo drew elf-blade sheath. To dismay edges gleamed dimly night. ‘Orcs!’ said. ‘Not near, yet near, seems.’ ‘I feared much,’ said Aragorn. ‘But maybe side River. The light Sting faint, may point spies Mordor roaming slopes Amon Lhaw. I never heard Orcs upon Amon Hen. Yet knows may happen evil days, Minas Tirith longer holds secure passages Anduin. We must go warily tomorrow.’ The day came like fire smoke. Low East black bars cloud like fumes great burning. The rising sun lit beneath flames murky red; soon climbed clear sky. The summit Tol Brandir tipped gold. Frodo looked eastward gazed tall island. Its sides sprang sheer running water. High tall cliffs steep slopes upon trees climbed, mounting one head another; grey faces inaccessible rock, crowned great spire stone. Many birds circling it, sign living things could seen. When eaten, Aragorn called Company together. ‘The day come last,’ said: ‘the day choice long delayed. What shall become Company travelled far fellowship? Shall turn west Boromir go wars Gondor; turn east Fear Shadow; shall break fellowship go way may choose? Whatever must done soon. We cannot long halt here. The enemy eastern shore, know; I fear Orcs may already side water.’ There long silence one spoke moved. ‘Well, Frodo,’ said Aragorn last. ‘I fear burden laid upon you. You Bearer appointed Council. Your way alone choose. In matter I cannot advise you. I Gandalf, though I tried bear part, I know design hope hour, indeed any. Most likely seems choice would still wait you. Such fate.’ Frodo answer once. Then spoke slowly. ‘I know haste needed, yet I cannot choose. The burden heavy. Give hour longer, I speak. Let alone!’ Aragorn looked kindly pity. ‘Very well, Frodo son Drogo,’ said. ‘You shall hour, shall alone. We stay while. But stray far call.’ Frodo sat moment head bowed. Sam, watching master great concern, shook head muttered: ‘Plain pikestaff is, it’s good Sam Gamgee putting spoke now.’ Presently Frodo got walked away; Sam saw others restrained stare him, eyes Boromir followed Frodo intently, passed sight trees foot Amon Hen. Wandering aimlessly first wood, Frodo found feet leading towards slopes hill. He came path, dwindling ruins road long ago. In steep places stairs stone hewn, cracked worn, split roots trees. For climbed, caring way went, came grassy place. Rowan-trees grew it, midst wide flat stone. The little upland lawn open upon East filled early sunlight. Frodo halted looked River, far him, Tol Brandir birds wheeling great gulf air untrodden isle. The voice Rauros mighty roaring mingled deep throbbing boom. He sat upon stone cupped chin hands, staring eastwards seeing little eyes. All happened since Bilbo left Shire passing mind, recalled pondered everything could remember Gandalf’s words. Time went on, still nearer choice. Suddenly awoke thoughts: strange feeling came something behind him, unfriendly eyes upon him. He sprang turned; saw surprise Boromir, face smiling kind. ‘I afraid you, Frodo,’ said, coming forward. ‘If Aragorn right Orcs near, none us wander alone, least all: much depends you. And heart heavy. May I stay talk while, since I found you? It would comfort me. Where many, speech becomes debate without end. But two together may perhaps find wisdom.’ ‘You kind,’ answered Frodo. ‘But I think speech help me. For I know I do, I afraid it, Boromir: afraid.’ Boromir stood silent. Rauros roared endlessly on. The wind murmured branches trees. Frodo shivered. Suddenly Boromir came sat beside him. ‘Are sure suffer needlessly?’ said. ‘I wish help you. Youneedcounselinyourhardchoice.Willyounottakemine?’ ‘I think I know already counsel would give, Boromir,’ said Frodo. ‘And would seem like wisdom warning heart.’ ‘Warning? Warning what?’ said Boromir sharply. ‘Against delay. Against way seems easier. Against refusal burden laid me. Against – well, must said, trust strength truth Men.’ ‘Yet strength long protected far away little country, though knew not.’ ‘I doubt valour people. But world changing. The walls Minas Tirith may strong, strong enough. If fail, then?’ ‘We shall fall battle valiantly. Yet still hope fail.’ ‘No hope Ring lasts,’ said Frodo. ‘Ah! The Ring!’ said Boromir, eyes lighting. ‘The Ring! Is strange fate suffer much fear doubt small thing? So small thing! And I seen instant house Elrond. Could I sight again?’ Frodo looked up. His heart went suddenly cold. He caught strange gleam Boromir’s eyes, yet face still kind friendly. ‘It best lie hidden,’ answered. ‘As wish. I care not,’ said Boromir. ‘Yet may I even speak it? For seem ever think power hands Enemy: evil uses good. The world changing, say. Minas Tirith fall, Ring lasts. But why? Certainly, Ring Enemy. But why, us?’ ‘Were Council?’ answered Frodo. ‘Because cannot use it, done turns evil.’ Boromir got walked impatiently. ‘So go on,’ cried. ‘Gandalf, Elrond – folk taught say so. For may right. These elves half-elves wizards, would come grief perhaps. Yet often I doubt wise merely timid. But kind. True-hearted Men, corrupted. We Minas Tirith staunch long years trial. We desire power wizardlords, strength defend ourselves, strength cause. And behold! need chance brings light Ring Power. It gift, I say; gift foes Mordor. It mad use it, use power Enemy him. The fearless, ruthless, alone achieve victory. What could warrior hour, great leader? What could Aragorn do? Or refuses, Boromir? The Ring would give power Command. How I would drive hosts Mordor, men would flock banner!’ Boromir strode down, speaking ever loudly. Almost seemed forgotten Frodo, talk dwelt walls weapons, mustering men; drew plans great alliances glorious victories be; cast Mordor, became mighty king, benevolent wise. Suddenly stopped waved arms. ‘And tell us throw away!’ cried. ‘I say destroy it. That might well, reason could show hope so. It not. The plan proposed us halfling walk blindly Mordor offer Enemy every chance recapturing himself. Folly! ‘Surely see it, friend?’ said, turning suddenly Frodo again. ‘You say afraid. If so, boldest pardon you. But really good sense revolts?’ ‘No, I afraid,’ said Frodo. ‘Simply afraid. But I glad heard speak fully. My mind clearer now.’ ‘Then come Minas Tirith?’ cried Boromir. His eyes shining face eager. ‘You misunderstand me,’ said Frodo. ‘But come, least while?’ Boromir persisted. ‘My city far now; little Mordor here. We long wilderness, need news Enemy make move. Come me, Frodo,’ said. ‘You need rest venture, go must.’ He laid hand hobbit’s shoulder friendly fashion; Frodo felt hand trembling suppressed excitement. He stepped quickly away, eyed alarm tall Man, nearly twice height many times match strength. ‘Why unfriendly?’ said Boromir. ‘I true man, neither thief tracker. I need Ring: know now; I give word I desire keep it. Will least let make trial plan? Lend Ring!’ ‘No! no!’ cried Frodo. ‘The Council laid upon bear it.’ ‘It folly Enemy defeat us,’ cried Boromir. ‘How angers me! Fool! Obstinate fool! Running wilfully death ruining cause. If mortals claim Ring, men Nu´menor, Halflings. It save unhappy chance. It might mine. It mine. Give me!’ Frodo answer, moved away till great flat stone stood them. ‘Come, come, friend!’ said Boromir softer voice. ‘Why get rid it? Why free doubt fear? You lay blame me, will. You say I strong took force. For I strong you, halfling,’ cried; suddenly sprang stone leaped Frodo. His fair pleasant face hideously changed; raging fire eyes. Frodo dodged aside put stone them. There one thing could do: trembling pulled Ring upon chain quickly slipped finger, even Boromir sprang again. The Man gasped, stared moment amazed, ran wildly about, seeking among rocks trees. ‘Miserable trickster!’ shouted. ‘Let get hands you! Now I see mind. You take Ring Sauron sell us all. You waited chance leave us lurch. Curse halflings death darkness!’ Then, catching foot stone, fell sprawling lay upon face. For still curse struck down; suddenly wept. He rose passed hand eyes, dashing away tears. ‘What I said?’ cried. ‘What I done? Frodo, Frodo!’ called. ‘Come back! A madness took me, passed. Come back!’ There answer. Frodo even hear cries. He already far away, leaping blindly path hill-top. Terror grief shook him, seeing thought mad fierce face Boromir, burning eyes. Soon came alone summit Amon Hen, halted, gasping breath. He saw mist wide flat circle, paved mighty flags, surrounded crumbling battlement; middle, set upon four carven pillars, high seat, reached stair many steps. Up went sat upon ancient chair, feeling like lost child clambered upon throne mountainkings. At first could see little. He seemed world mist shadows: Ring upon him. Then mist gave way saw many visions: small clear eyes upon table, yet remote. There sound, bright living images. The world seemed shrunk fallen silent. He sitting upon Seat Seeing, Amon Hen, Hill Eye Men Nu´menor. Eastward looked wide uncharted lands, nameless plains, forests unexplored. Northward looked, Great River lay like ribbon beneath him, Misty Mountains stood small hard broken teeth. Westward looked saw broad pastures Rohan; Orthanc, pinnacle Isengard, like black spike. Southward looked, feet Great River curled like toppling wave plunged falls Rauros foaming pit; glimmering rainbow played upon fume. And Ethir Anduin saw, mighty delta River, myriads sea-birds whirling like white dust sun, beneath green silver sea, rippling endless lines. But everywhere looked saw signs war. The Misty Mountains crawling like anthills: orcs issuing thousand holes. Under boughs Mirkwood deadly strife Elves Men fell beasts. The land Beornings aflame; cloud Moria; smoke rose borders Lo´rien. Horsemen galloping grass Rohan; wolves poured Isengard. From havens Harad ships war put sea; East Men moving endlessly: swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon horses, chariots chieftains laden wains. All power Dark Lord motion. Then turning south beheld Minas Tirith. Faraway seemed, andbeautiful: white-walled, many-towered, proud fair upon mountain-seat; battlementsglitteredwithsteel,anditsturretswere bright many banners. Hope leaped heart. But Minas Tirith set another fortress, greater strong. Thither, eastward, unwilling eye drawn. It passed ruined bridges Osgiliath, grinning gates Minas Morgul, haunted Mountains, looked upon Gorgoroth, valley terror Land Mordor. Darkness lay Sun. Fire glowed amid smoke. Mount Doom burning, great reek rising. Then last gaze held: wall upon wall, battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain iron, gate steel, tower adamant, saw it: Barad-duˆr, Fortress Sauron. All hope left him. And suddenly felt Eye. There eye Dark Tower sleep. He knew become aware gaze. A fierce eager there. It leaped towards him; almost like finger felt it, searching him. Very soon would nail down, know exactly was. Amon Lhaw touched. It glanced upon Tol Brandir – threw seat, crouching, covering head grey hood. He heard crying out: Never, never! Or it: Verily I come, I come you? He could tell. Then flash point power came mind another thought: Take off! Take off! Fool, take off! Take Ring! The two powers strove him. For moment, perfectly balanced piercing points, writhed, tormented. Suddenly aware again, Frodo, neither Voice Eye: free choose, one remaining instant so. He took Ring finger. He kneeling clear sunlight high seat. A black shadow seemed pass like arm him; missed Amon Hen groped west, faded. Then sky clean blue birds sang every tree. Frodo rose feet. A great weariness him, firm heart lighter. He spoke aloud himself. ‘I I must,’ said. ‘This least plain: evil Ring already work even Company, Ring must leave harm. I go alone. Some I cannot trust, I trust dear me: poor old Sam, Merry Pippin. Strider, too: heart yearns Minas Tirith, needed there, Boromir fallen evil. I go alone. At once.’ He went quickly path came back lawn Boromir found him. Then halted, listening. He thought could hear cries calls woods near shore below. ‘They’ll hunting me,’ said. ‘I wonder long I away. Hours, I think.’ He hesitated. ‘What I do?’ muttered. ‘I must go I shall never go. I shan’t get chance again. I hate leaving them, like without explanation. But surely understand. Sam will. And else I do?’ Slowly drew Ring put more. He vanished passed hill, less rustle wind. The others remained long river-side. For time silent, moving restlessly about; sitting circle, talking. Every made efforts speak things, long road many adventures; questioned Aragorn concerning realm Gondor ancient history, remnants great works could still seen strange border-land Emyn Muil: stone kings seats Lhaw Hen, great Stair beside falls Rauros. But always thoughts words strayed back Frodo Ring. What would Frodo choose do? Why hesitating? ‘He debating course desperate, I think,’ said Aragorn. ‘And well may. It hopeless ever Company go east, since tracked Gollum, must fear secret journey already betrayed. But Minas Tirith nearer Fire destruction Burden. ‘We may remain make brave stand; Lord Denethor men cannot hope even Elrond said beyond power: either keep Burden secret, hold full might Enemy comes take it. Which way would us choose Frodo’s place? I know. Now indeed miss Gandalf most.’ ‘Grievous loss,’ said Legolas. ‘Yet must needs make minds without aid. Why cannot decide, help Frodo? Let us call back vote! I vote Minas Tirith.’ ‘And I,’ said Gimli. ‘We, course, sent help Bearer along road, go wished; none us oath command seek Mount Doom. Hard parting Lothlo´rien. Yet I come far, I say this: reached last choice, clear I cannot leave Frodo. I would choose Minas Tirith, not, I follow him.’ ‘And I go him,’ said Legolas. ‘It would faithless say farewell.’ ‘It would indeed betrayal, left him,’ said Aragorn. ‘But goes east, need go him; I think should. That venture desperate: much eight three two, one alone. If would let choose, I appoint three companions: Sam, could bear otherwise; Gimli; myself. Boromir return city, father people need him; others go, least Meriadoc Peregrin, Legolas willing leave us.’ ‘That won’t all!’ cried Merry. ‘We can’t leave Frodo! Pippin I always intended go wherever went, still do. But realize would mean. It seemed different far away, Shire Rivendell. It would mad cruel let Frodo go Mordor. Why can’t stop him?’ ‘We must stop him,’ said Pippin. ‘And worrying about, I sure. He knows shan’t agree going east. And doesn’t like ask anyone go him, poor old fellow. Imagine it: going Mordor alone!’ Pippin shuddered. ‘But dear silly old hobbit, ought know hasn’t got ask. He ought know can’t stop him, shan’t leave him.’ ‘Begging pardon,’ said Sam. ‘I don’t think understand master all. He isn’t hesitating way go. Of course not! What’s good Minas Tirith anyway? To him, I mean, begging pardon, Master Boromir,’ added, turned. It discovered Boromir, first sitting silent outside circle, longer there. ‘Now where’s got to?’ cried Sam, looking worried. ‘He’s bit queer lately, mind. But anyway he’s business. He’s home, always said; blame him. But Mr. Frodo, knows he’s got find Cracks Doom, can. But he’s afraid. Now it’s come point, he’s plain terrified. That’s trouble is. Of course he’s bit schooling, speak – – since left home, he’d terrified he’d fling Ring River bolt. But he’s still frightened start. And isn’t worrying us either: whether we’ll go along no. He knows mean to. That’s another thing that’s bothering him. If screws go, he’ll want go alone. Mark words! We’re going trouble comes back. For he’ll screw right, sure name’s Baggins.’ ‘I believe speak wisely us, Sam,’ said Aragorn. ‘And shall do, prove right?’ ‘Stop him! Don’t let go!’ cried Pippin. ‘I wonder?’ said Aragorn. ‘He Bearer, fate Burden him. I think part drive one way other. Nor I think succeed, tried. There powers work far stronger.’ ‘Well, I wish Frodo would ‘‘screw up’’ come back, let us get over,’ said Pippin. ‘This waiting horrible! Surely time up?’ ‘Yes,’ said Aragorn. ‘The hour long passed. The morning wearing away. We must call him.’ At moment Boromir reappeared. He came trees walked towards without speaking. His face looked grim sad. He paused counting present, sat aloof, eyes ground. ‘Where been, Boromir?’ asked Aragorn. ‘Have seen Frodo?’ Boromir hesitated second. ‘Yes, no,’ answered slowly. ‘Yes: I found way hill, I spoke him. I urged come Minas Tirith go east. I grew angry left me. He vanished. I never seen thing happen before, though I heard tales. He must put Ring on. I could find again. I thought would return you.’ ‘Is say?’ said Aragorn, looking hard kindly Boromir. ‘Yes,’ answered. ‘I say yet.’ ‘This bad!’ cried Sam, jumping up. ‘I don’t know Man to. Why Mr. Frodo put thing on? He didn’t ought have; has, goodness knows may happened!’ ‘But wouldn’t keep on,’ said Merry. ‘Not escaped unwelcome visitor, like Bilbo used to.’ ‘But go? Where he?’ cried Pippin. ‘He’s away ages now.’ ‘How long since saw Frodo last, Boromir?’ asked Aragorn. ‘Half hour, maybe,’ answered. ‘Or might hour. I wandered time since. I know! I know!’ He put head hands, sat bowed grief. ‘An hour since vanished!’ shouted Sam. ‘We must try find once. Come on!’ ‘Wait moment!’ cried Aragorn. ‘We must divide pairs, arrange – here, hold on! Wait!’ It good. They took notice him. Sam dashed first. Merry Pippin followed, already disappearing westward trees shore, shouting: Frodo! Frodo! clear, high, hobbit-voices. Legolas Gimli running. A sudden panic madness seemed fallen Company. ‘We shall scattered lost,’ groaned Aragorn. ‘Boromir!Ido know part played mischief, help now! Go two young hobbits, guard least, even cannot find Frodo. Come back spot, find him, traces him. I shall return soon.’ Aragorn sprang swiftly away went pursuit Sam. Just reached little lawn among rowans overtook him, toiling uphill, panting calling, Frodo! ‘Come me, Sam!’ said. ‘None us alone. There mischief about. I feel it. I going top, Seat Amon Hen, see may seen. And look! It heart guessed, Frodo went way. Follow me, keep eyes open!’ He sped path. Sam best, could keep Strider Ranger, soon fell behind. He gone far Aragorn sight ahead. Sam stopped puffed. Suddenly clapped hand head. ‘Whoa, Sam Gamgee!’ said aloud. ‘Your legs short, use head! Let see now! Boromir isn’t lying, that’s way; hasn’t told us everything. Something scared Mr. Frodo badly. He screwed point, sudden. He made mind last – go. Where to? Off East. Not without Sam? Yes, without even Sam. That’s hard, cruel hard.’ Sam passed hand eyes, brushing away tears. ‘Steady, Gamgee!’ said. ‘Think, can! He can’t fly across rivers, can’t jump waterfalls. He’s got gear. So he’s got get back boats. Back boats! Back boats, Sam, like lightning!’ Sam turned bolted back path. He fell cut knees. Up got ran on. He came edge lawn Parth Galen shore, boats drawn water. No one there. There seemed cries woods behind, heed them. He stood gazing moment, stock-still, gaping. A boat sliding bank itself. With shout Sam raced across grass. The boat slipped water. ‘Coming, Mr. Frodo! Coming!’ called Sam, flung bank, clutching departing boat. He missed yard. With cry splash fell face downward deep swift water. Gurgling went under, River closed curly head. An exclamation dismay came empty boat. A paddle swirled boat put about. Frodo time grasp Sam hair came up, bubbling struggling. Fear staring round brown eyes. ‘Up come, Sam lad!’ said Frodo. ‘Now take hand!’ ‘Save me, Mr. Frodo!’ gasped Sam. ‘I’m drownded. I can’t see hand.’ ‘Here is. Don’t pinch, lad! I won’t let go. Tread water don’t flounder, you’ll upset boat. There now, get hold side, let use paddle!’ With strokes Frodo brought boat back bank, Sam able scramble out, wet water-rat. Frodo took Ring stepped ashore again. ‘Of confounded nuisances worst, Sam!’ said. ‘Oh, Mr. Frodo, that’s hard!’ said Sam shivering. ‘That’s hard, trying go without all. If I hadn’t guessed right, would now?’ ‘Safely way.’ ‘Safely!’ said Sam. ‘All alone without help you? I couldn’t borne it, it’d death me.’ ‘It would death come me, Sam,’ said Frodo, ‘and I could borne that.’ ‘Not certain left behind,’ said Sam. ‘But I going Mordor.’ ‘I know well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course are. And I’m coming you.’ ‘Now, Sam,’ said Frodo, ‘don’t hinder me! The others coming back minute. If catch here, I shall argue explain, I shall never heart chance get off. But I must go once. It’s way.’ ‘Of course is,’ answered Sam. ‘But alone. I’m coming too, neither us isn’t going. I’ll knock holes boats first.’ Frodo actually laughed. A sudden warmth gladness touched heart. ‘Leave one!’ said. ‘We’ll need it. But can’t come like without gear food anything.’ ‘Just hold moment, I’ll get stuff!’ cried Sam eagerly. ‘It’s ready. I thought today.’ He rushed camping place, fished pack pile Frodo laid emptied boat companions’ goods, grabbed spare blanket, extra packages food, ran back. ‘So plan spoilt!’ said Frodo. ‘It good trying escape you. But I’m glad, Sam. I cannot tell glad. Come along! It plain meant go together. We go, may others find safe road! Strider look them. I don’t suppose shall see again.’ ‘Yet may, Mr. Frodo. We may,’ said Sam. So Frodo Sam set last stage Quest together. Frodo paddled away shore, River bore swiftly away, western arm, past frowning cliffs Tol Brandir. The roar great falls drew nearer. Even help Sam could give, hard work pass across current southward end island drive boat eastward towards far shore. At length came land upon southern slopes Amon Lhaw. There found shelving shore, drew boat out, high water, hid well could behind great boulder. Then shouldering burdens, set off, seeking path would bring grey hills Emyn Muil, Land Shadow. .

Tolkien’s The Lord Rings often erroneously called trilogy, fact single novel, consisting six books plus appendices, sometimes published three volumes. The first volume, The Fellowship Ring, published Great Britain London firm George Allen & Unwin 29 July 1954; American edition followed 21 October year, published Houghton Mifflin Company Boston. In production first volume, Tolkien experienced became continual problem: printer’s errors compositor’s mistakes, including wellintentioned ‘corrections’ sometimes idiosyncratic usage. These ‘corrections’ include altering dwarves dwarfs, elvish elfish, farther, nasturtians nasturtiums, try say try say (‘worst all’ Tolkien) elven elfin. In work The Lord Rings, containing invented languages delicately constructed nomenclatures, errors inconsistencies impede understanding appreciation serious readers – Tolkien many readers early on. Even publication third volume, contained much hitherto unrevealed information invented languages writing systems, Tolkien received many letters readers written systems, addition numerous enquiries finer points usage. The second volume, The Two Towers, published England 11 November 1954 United States 21 April 1955. Meanwhile Tolkien worked keep promise made foreword volume one: ‘an index names strange words’ would appear third volume. As originally planned, index would contain much etymological information languages, particularly elven tongues, large vocabulary. It proved chief cause delay publishing volume three, end contained index all, apology publisher absence. For Tolkien abandoned work indexing volumes one two, believing size therefore cost ruinous. Volume three, The Return King, finally appeared England 20 October 1955 United States 5 January 1956. With appearance third volume, The Lord Rings published entirety, first edition text remained virtually unchanged decade. Tolkien made small corrections, errors entered The Fellowship Ring December 1954 second impression printer, distributed type first printing, reset book without informing author publisher. These include misrepresentations original printed text – is, words phrases read acceptably context, depart Tolkien’s wording originally written published. In 1965, stemming appeared copyright problems United States, American paperback firm published unauthorized non-royalty-paying edition The Lord Rings. For new edition Ace Books text narrative reset, thus introducing new typographical errors; appendices, however, reproduced photographically hardcover edition, remain consistent it. Tolkien set work first revision text newly revised authorized edition could successfully compete American market. This first revision text published America paperback Ballantine Books, licence Houghton Mifflin, October 1965. In addition revisions within text itself, Tolkien replaced original foreword new one. He pleased remove original foreword; check copy, wrote it: ‘confusing (as does) real personal matters ‘‘machinery’’ Tale, serious mistake’. Tolkien also added extension prologue index – detailed index names promised first edition, but, rather, bald index names page references. Additionally, time appendices greatly revised. Tolkien received copies Ballantine edition late January 1966, early February recorded diary ‘worked hours Appendices Ballantine version & found errors I first expected’. Soon sent small number revisions Ballantine appendices, including well-known addition ‘Estella Bolger’ wife Meriadoc family trees Appendix C. Most revisions, entered variously third fourth impressions (June August 1966) volume three, always inserted correctly (thereby causing confusion text), somehow never made main sequence revision three-volume British hardcover edition, long remained anomalies. Tolkien wrote, concerning revising The Lord Rings, perhaps failed keep notes order; errant branch revision seems likely example disorder – either notes ability publishers follow utmost accuracy. The revised text first appeared Great Britain threevolume hardcover ‘Second Edition’ Allen & Unwin 27 October 1966. But problems. Although revisions Tolkien sent America text available utilized new British edition, extensive revisions appendices lost entered Ballantine edition. Allen & Unwin forced reset appendices using copy published first Ballantine edition. This include Tolkien’s second, small set revisions sent Ballantine; but, significantly, include great number errors omissions, many discovered long afterwards. Thus, appendices, close scrutiny first edition text much later corrected impressions second edition necessary discern whether particular change edition authorial erroneous. In America, revised text appeared hardcover three-volume edition published Houghton Mifflin 27 February 1967. This text evidently photo-offset 1966 Allen & Unwin three-volume hardcover, thus consistent it. Aside first printing second Houghton Mifflin edition, 1967 date title page, none many reprintings dated. After initial printings edition, bore 1966 copyright notice, date copyright changed 1965 match statement Ballantine edition. This change caused great deal confusion librarians researchers tried sort sequence publication editions. Meanwhile, Tolkien spent much summer 1966 revising text. In June learned revisions late inclusion 1966 Allen & Unwin second edition, recorded diary: ‘But I attempting complete work [on revisions] – I cannot leave mind. So much time wasted work constant breaking threads.’ This last major set revisions Tolkien made text lifetime. They added second impression (1967) three-volume hardcover Allen & Unwin second edition. The revisions mostly include corrections nomenclature attempts consistency usage throughout three volumes. Some small alterations made Tolkien 1969 one-volume India paper edition. J.R.R. Tolkien died 1973. His third son literary executor, Christopher Tolkien, sent large number corrections misprints, mainly appendices index, Allen & Unwin use editions 1974. Most corrections typographical, line father’s expressed intent check copies. Since 1974, Christopher Tolkien sent additional corrections, errors discovered, British publishers The Lord Rings (Allen & Unwin, later Unwin Hyman, HarperCollins), tried conscientious impossible task maintaining textual integrity whichever editions The Lord Rings published. However, every time text reset publication new format (e.g. various paperback editions published England 1970s 1980s), huge numbers new misprints crept in, though times errors observed corrected later printings. Still, throughout years three-volume British hardcover edition retained highest textual integrity. In United States, text Ballantine paperback remained unchanged three decades Tolkien added revisions 1966. The text Houghton Mifflin editions remained unchanged 1967 1987, Houghton Mifflin photo-offset current three-volume British hardcover edition order update text used editions. In new reprintings number corrections (overseen Christopher Tolkien) added, errant Ballantine branch revision (including ‘Estella Bolger’ addition) integrated main branch textual descent. This method correction involved cut-and-paste process printed versions text. Beginning 1987 Houghton Mifflin edition, earlier version ‘Note Text’ (dated October 1986) added The Lord Rings. This ‘Note’ reworked three times since – version dated April 1993 first appeared 1994, version dated April 2002 came later year. The present ‘Note’ replaces supersedes previous versions. For 1994 British edition published HarperCollins, text The Lord Rings entered wordprocessing files. This next stage textual evolution came allow greater uniformity text future editions, it, inevitably, came new wrinkles. Some new misreadings entered text, time others fixed. In worst instance, one line ring inscription chapter ‘The Shadow Past’ The Fellowship Ring simply dropped. Unforeseeable glitches arose editions base computerized text transferred page-making typesetting programs – e.g., one edition The Fellowship Ring, closing two sentences ‘The Council Elrond’ simply inexplicably disappeared. Such glitches much exception, rule, text otherwise maintained consistency integrity throughout computerized evolution. The 1994 edition also contained number new corrections (again supervised Christopher Tolkien), well reconfigured index names page references. The 1994 text first used American editions published Houghton Mifflin 1999. A small number corrections added 2002 three-volume edition illustrated Alan Lee, published HarperCollins Great Britain Houghton Mifflin United States. The textual history The Lord Rings, merely published form, vast complex web. In brief note I given glimpse overall sequence structure. Further details revisions corrections made years published text The Lord Rings, fuller account publishing history, may found J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography, Wayne G. Hammond, assistance Douglas A. Anderson (1993). For interested observing gradual evolving The Lord Rings earliest drafts published form, I highly recommend Christopher Tolkien’s account, appears within five volumes twelve-volume series The History Middle-earth. Volumes six nine contain major part study pertaining The Lord Rings: The Return Shadow (1988); The Treason Isengard (1989); The War Ring (1990); Sauron Defeated (1992). Also, final book series, The Peoples Middle-earth (1996), covers evolution prologue appendices The Lord Rings. These volumes contain engrossing over-the-shoulder account growth writing Tolkien’s masterpiece. The process studying Tolkien’s manuscripts The Lord Rings involved deciphering versions Tolkien wrote first pencil ink atop pencilled draft. Christopher Tolkien decribed father’s method composition The Return Shadow: ‘In handwriting used rapid drafts sketches, intended endure long turned gave workable form, letters loosely formed word cannot deduced guessed context later versions prove perfectly opaque long examination; if, often did, used soft pencil much become blurred faint.’ The true difficulty reading double-drafts observed frontispiece The War Ring, reproduces colour Tolkien’s illustration ‘Shelob’s Lair’ page Tolkien’s manuscript. Looking closely hasty ink draft alongside illustration, one see underneath earlier, hastier, pencilled draft. Also The War Ring, Christopher Tolkien reproduces page first manuscript chapter ‘The Taming Sme´agol’, printed text corresponding text facing page (see pp. 90–91). One astonished anyone’s ability decipher texts. That difficulty aside, books signify ordinary readers Tolkien scholars? And ‘the history writing’ book? Simply, volumes show great detail development story The Lord Rings earliest drafts hasty projections completion. We see earliest materials much children’s book, sequel The Hobbit, story grows various ‘phases’, increase seriousness depth. We see alternate branches development, gradual blending merging certain characters, slow emergence nature rings motivations characters. Some various ideas abandoned altogether, others reworked variant form may may survive final version. One could make whole catalogue interesting tidbits Christopher Tolkien’s study – fact Strider called Trotter late stage writing book; Trotter one time hobbit, named wore wooden shoes; Tolkien one point considered romance Aragorn E´owyn; Tolkien wrote epilogue book, tying loose ends, dropped publication (and appears Sauron Defeated); on. But developments best appreciated read within context Christopher Tolkien’s commentary rather discussed separately. The significant achievement volumes show us Tolkien wrote thought. Nowhere else see authorial process work detail. Tolkien’s hastiest comments story might proceed, can’t go way – queries written out: Tolkien literally thinking paper. This gives added dimension understanding Tolkien’s comment Stanley Unwin 1963 letter that, suffering trouble shoulder right arm, ‘I found able use pen pencil defeating loss beak would hen.’ And we, readers volumes, share Tolkien wonder bewilderment new characters appearing nowhere, sudden change development, moment emergence story. I know instance literature ‘history writing’ book, told mostly author himself, hesitations false paths laid us, sorted out, commented upon, served reader like feast. We shown innumerable instances minutest detail thought-process work. We see author fully absorbed creation sake. And exceptional history unfolding story text, evolution world. There additional wealth material beyond simple narrative text. There maps illustrations. There languages writing systems, histories peoples spoke wrote systems. All additional materials add multiple dimensions complexity appreciation invented world itself. Fifty years published life The Lord Rings, seems extraordinary masterful work literature also companion unparalleled account writing. Our gratitude readers goes Tolkiens, father son. Douglas A. Anderson May 2004 NOTE ON THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION In edition The Lord Rings, prepared fiftieth anniversary publication, three four hundred emendations made following exhaustive review past editions printings. The present text based setting HarperCollins three-volume hardcover edition 2002, turn revision HarperCollins reset edition 1994. As Douglas A. Anderson comments preceding ‘Note Text’, editions corrected, also introduced new errors. At time, errors survived undetected, among five dozen entered long ago 1954, resetting The Fellowship Ring published ‘second impression’. That printer quietly reset The Fellowship Ring, copies issued without proof read author, never became known Tolkien; publisher, Rayner Unwin, learned thirtyeight years fact. Tolkien found unauthorized changes introduced second printing (probably preparing second edition 1965) read copy twelfth impression (1962), thought errors newly made. These, among others, corrected course reprinting. Then 1992 Eric Thompson, reader keen eye typographic detail, noticed small differences first second impressions The Fellowship Ring called attention present editors. About one-sixth errors entered second printing quickly came light. Many revealed recently, Steven M. Frisby used ingenious optical aids make comparison copies The Lord Rings greater detail previously accomplished. We gladly made full use Mr Frisby’s results, generously shared discussed. In course fifty-year history The Lord Rings many readers recorded changes made various appearances print, document gone aid achievement authoritative text. Errors possible errors reported author publishers, information textual history work circulated among Tolkien enthusiasts least early 1966, Banks Mebane published ‘Prolegomena Variorum Tolkien’ fanzine Entmoot. Most notably later years, Douglas A. Anderson forefront efforts achieve accurate text The Lord Rings (and The Hobbit); Christina Scull published ‘A Preliminary Study Variations Editions The Lord Rings’ Beyond Bree (April August 1985); Wayne G. Hammond compiled extensive lists textual changes J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography (1993); David Bratman published important article, ‘A Corrigenda The Lord Rings’, March 1994 number The Tolkien Collector. The observations Dainis Bisenieks, Yuval Welis, Charles Noad, readers, sent us directly posted public forums, also service. Efforts follow example author The Lord Rings lifetime. His concern textual accuracy coherence work evident many emendations made later printings, notes made emendations one reason another previously (or partly) put effect. Even late life, labours wearied him, feelings clear. On 30 October 1967 wrote Joy Hill George Allen & Unwin, concerning reader’s query received points Appendices The Lord Rings: ‘Personally I ceased bother minor ‘‘discrepancies’’, since genealogies calendars etc. lack verisimilitude general excessive accuracy: compared real annals genealogies! Anyway slips few, mostly removed, discovery remain seems amusing pastime! But errors text another matter’ (italics ours). In fact Tolkien ‘ceased bother’, ‘slips’ dealt opportunities arose. These, indulgence publisher, allowed Tolkien luxury authors enjoy: multiple chances correct text improve it, develop languages, geography, peoples Middle-earth. The fiftieth anniversary The Lord Rings seemed ideal opportunity consider latest (2002) text light information gathered course decades work Tolkien studies, Steve Frisby’s research hand, electronic copy The Lord Rings (supplied HarperCollins) searchable keyword phrase. The latter especially allowed us develop lists words varied one instance another, investigate variations usage, stood copy-text relative earlier editions printings. Of course Tolkien wrote The Lord Rings long period time, eighteen years, inconsistencies text almost inevitable. Christopher Tolkien even observed us apparent inconsistencies form father’s work may even deliberate: instance, although Tolkien carefully distinguished house ‘dwelling’ House ‘noble family dynasty’, two instances used house latter sense lower case, perhaps capital letter would detracted importance adjective word paired (‘royal house’, ‘golden house’). There doubt, however, Tolkien attempted correct inconsistency, less outright error, whenever came attention, opinion, advice agreement Christopher Tolkien, attempt made anniversary edition, far could carefully conservatively distinguish emend. Many emendations present text marks punctuation, either correct recent typographical errors repair surviving alterations introduced second printing The Fellowship Ring. In latter respect every case, Tolkien’s original punctuation always felicitous – subtle points, one comparing commas semi-colons, less part author’s intended expression. Distinctive words chill rather cold, glistered rather glistened, changed typesetters long ago without authorization, likewise restored. A controlled amount regularization also seemed called for, naught rather nought, change instituted Tolkien carried instances; Dark Power rather dark power reference obviouslytoSauron(orMorgoth);Barrow-downsbyTolkien’s preference rather Barrowdowns; likewise Bree-hill rather Bree Hill; accented common Dru´adan rather Druadan; capitalized names seasons used personification metaphor, according Tolkien’s predominant practice internal logic text; Elvish rather elvish used separate adjective, following preference Tolkien marked copy second edition The Lord Rings. In addition, added second accent Nu´meno´rean(s), Tolkien often wrote name manuscript appears The Silmarillion posthumous publications. The result, nonetheless, still includes many variations capitalization, punctuation, points style. Not erroneous: include words Sun, Moon, Hobbit, Man (or sun, moon, hobbit, man), may change form according meaning application, relation adjacent adjectives, whether Tolkien intended personification, poetry, emphasis. His intent cannot divined confidence every case. But possible discern Tolkien’s preferences many instances, statements wrote check copies The Lord Rings close analysis text manuscript, typescript, proof, print. Whenever doubt whatsoever author’s intentions, text allowed stand. Most demonstrable errors noted Christopher Tolkien The History Middle-earth also corrected, distance Brandywine Bridge Ferry (ten miles rather twenty) number Merry’s ponies (five rather six), shadows earlier drafts. But inconsistencies content, Gimli’s famous (and erroneous) statement Book III, Chapter 7, ‘Till I hewn naught wood since I left Moria’, would require rewriting emend rather simple correction, remain unchanged. So many new emendations The Lord Rings, extensive review text, deserve fully documented. Although readers content text alone, many want know problems encountered preparing new edition, solutions (where solutions possible), especially text emended, also not. To end, illuminate work respects, preparing volume annotations The Lord Rings publication 2005. This allow us discuss, length impossible prefatory note, various textual cruces The Lord Rings, identify changes made present text, remark significant alterations published work throughout history.

Wayne G. Hammond & Christina Scull May 2004 FOREWORD TO THE SECOND EDITION This tale grew telling, became history Great War Ring included many glimpses yet ancient history preceded it. It begun soon The Hobbit written publication 1937; I go sequel, I wished first complete set order mythology legends Elder Days, taking shape years. I desired satisfaction, I little hope people would interested work, especially since primarily linguistic inspiration begun order provide necessary background ‘history’ Elvish tongues. When whose advice opinion I sought corrected little hope hope, I went back sequel, encouraged requests readers information concerning hobbits adventures. But story drawn irresistibly towards older world, became account, were, end passing away beginning middle told. The process begun writing The Hobbit, already references older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, High-elves, orcs, well glimpses arisen unbidden things higher deeper darker surface: Durin, Moria, Gandalf, Necromancer, Ring. The discovery significance glimpses relation ancient histories revealed Third Age culmination War Ring. Those asked information hobbits eventually got it, wait long time; composition The Lord Rings went intervals years 1936 1949, period I many duties I neglect, many interests learner teacher often absorbed me. The delay was, course, also increased outbreak war 1939, end year tale yet reached end Book One. In spite darkness next five years I found story could wholly abandoned, I plodded on, mostly night, till I stood Balin’s tomb Moria. There I halted long while. It almost year later I went came Lothlo´rien Great River late 1941. In next year I wrote first drafts matter stands Book Three, beginnings chapters I III Book Five; beacons flared Ano´rien The´oden came Harrowdale I stopped. Foresight failed time thought. It 1944 that, leaving loose ends perplexities war task conduct, least report, I forced tackle journey Frodo Mordor. These chapters, eventually become Book Four, written sent serial son, Christopher, South Africa RAF. Nonetheless took another five years tale brought present end; time I changed house, chair, college, days though less dark less laborious. Then ‘end’ last reached whole story revised, indeed largely re-written backwards. And typed, re-typed: me; cost professional typing ten-fingered beyond means. The Lord Rings read many people since finally appeared print; I like say something reference many opinions guesses I received read concerning motives meaning tale. The prime motive desire tale-teller try hand really long story would hold attention readers, amuse them, delight them, times maybe excite deeply move them. As guide I feelings appealing moving, many guide inevitably often fault. Some xxvii read book, rate reviewed it, found boring, absurd, contemptible; I cause complain, since I similar opinions works, kinds writing evidently prefer. But even points view many enjoyed story much fails please. It perhaps possible long tale please everybody points, displease everybody points; I find letters I received passages chapters blemish others specially approved. The critical reader all, myself, finds many defects, minor major, fortunately obligation either review book write again, pass silence, except one noted others: book short. As inner meaning ‘message’, intention author none. It neither allegorical topical. As story grew put roots (into past) threw unexpected branches: main theme settled outset inevitable choice Ring link The Hobbit. The crucial chapter, ‘The Shadow Past’, one oldest parts tale. It written long foreshadow 1939 yet become threat inevitable disaster, point story would developed along essentially lines, disaster averted. Its sources things long mind, cases already written, little nothing modified war began 1939 sequels. The real war resemble legendary war process conclusion. If inspired directed development legend, certainly Ring would seized used Sauron; would annihilated enslaved, Barad-duˆr would destroyed occupied. Saruman, failing get possession Ring, would confusion treacheries time found Mordor missing links researches Ring-lore, long would made Great Ring challenge self-styled Ruler Middle-earth. In conflict sides would held hobbits hatred contempt: would long survived even slaves. Other arrangements could devised according tastes views like allegory topical reference. But I cordially dislike allegory manifestations, always done since I grew old wary enough detect presence. I much prefer history, true feigned, varied applicability thought experience readers. I think many confuse ‘applicability’ ‘allegory’; one resides freedom reader, purposed domination author. An author cannot course remain wholly unaffected experience, ways story-germ uses soil experience extremely complex, attempts define process best guesses evidence inadequate ambiguous. It also false, though naturally attractive, lives author critic overlapped, suppose movements thought events times common necessarily powerful influences. One indeed personally come shadow war feel fully oppression; years go seems often forgotten caught youth 1914 less hideous experience involved 1939 following years. By 1918 one close friends dead. Or take less grievous matter: supposed ‘The Scouring Shire’ reflects situation England time I finishing tale. It not. It essential part plot, foreseen outset, though event modified character Saruman developed story without, need I say, allegorical significance contemporary political reference whatsoever. It indeed basis experience, though slender (for economic situation entirely different), much back. The xxix country I lived childhood shabbily destroyed I ten, days motor-cars rare objects (I never seen one) men still building suburban railways. Recently I saw paper picture last decrepitude thriving corn-mill beside pool long ago seemed important. I never liked looks Young miller, father, Old miller, black beard, named Sandyman. The Lord Rings issued new edition, opportunity taken revising it. A number errors inconsistencies still remained text corrected, attempt made provide information points attentive readers raised. I considered comments enquiries, seem passed may I failed keep notes order; many enquiries could answered additional appendices, indeed production accessory volume containing much material I include original edition, particular detailed linguistic information. In meantime edition offers Foreword, addition Prologue, notes, index names persons places. This index intention complete items references, since present purpose necessary reduce bulk. A complete index, making full use material prepared Mrs. N. Smith, belongs rather accessory volume. . PROLOGUE 1 Concerning Hobbits This book largely concerned Hobbits, pages reader may discover much character little history. Further information also found selection Red Book Westmarch already published, title The Hobbit. That story derived earlier chapters Red Book, composed Bilbo himself, first Hobbit become famous world large, called There Back Again, since told journey East return: adventure later involved Hobbits great events Age related. Many, however, may wish know remarkable people outset, may possess earlier book. For readers notes important points collected Hobbit-lore, first adventure briefly recalled. Hobbits unobtrusive ancient people, numerous formerly today; love peace quiet good tilled earth: well-ordered wellfarmed countryside favourite haunt. They understand like machines complicated forge-bellows, water-mill, hand-loom, though skilful tools. Even ancient days were, rule, shy ‘the Big Folk’, call us, avoid us dismay becoming hard find. They quick hearing sharp-eyed, though inclined fat hurry unnecessarily, nonetheless nimble deft movements. They possessed first art disappearing swiftly silently, large folk wish meet come blundering by; art developed Men may seem magical. But Hobbits never, fact, studied magic kind, elusiveness due solely professional skill heredity practice, close friendship earth, rendered inimitable bigger clumsier races. For little people, smaller Dwarves: less stout stocky, is, even actually much shorter. Their height variable, ranging two four feet measure. They seldom reach three feet; dwindled, say, ancient days taller. According Red Book, Bandobras Took (Bullroarer), son Isumbras Third, four foot five able ride horse. He surpassed Hobbit records two famous characters old; curious matter dealt book. As Hobbits Shire, tales concerned, days peace prosperity merry folk. They dressed bright colours, notably fond yellow green; seldom wore shoes, since feet tough leathery soles clad thick curling hair, much like hair heads, commonly brown. Thus, craft little practised among shoe-making; long skilful fingers could make many useful comely things. Their faces rule good-natured rather beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked, mouths apt laughter, eating drinking. And laugh did, eat, drink, often heartily, fond simple jests times, six meals day (when could get them). They hospitable delighted parties, presents, gave away freely eagerly accepted. It plain indeed spite later estrangement Hobbits relatives ours: far nearer us Elves, even Dwarves. Of old spoke languages Men, fashion, liked disliked much things Men did. But exactly relationship longer discovered. The beginning Hobbits lies far back Elder Days lost forgotten. Only Elves still preserve records vanished time, traditions concerned almost entirely history, Men appear seldom Hobbits mentioned all. Yet clear Hobbits had, fact, lived quietly Middle-earth many long years folk became even aware them. And world full strange creatures beyond count, little people seemed little importance. But days Bilbo, Frodo heir, suddenly became, wish own, important renowned, troubled counsels Wise Great. Those days, Third Age Middle-earth, long past, shape lands changed; regions Hobbits lived doubtless still linger: North-West Old World, east Sea. Of original home Hobbits Bilbo’s time preserved knowledge. A love learning (other genealogical lore) far general among them, remained still older families studied books, even gathered reports old times distant lands Elves, Dwarves, Men. Their records began settlement Shire, ancient legends hardly looked back Wandering Days. It clear, nonetheless, legends, evidence peculiar words customs, like many folk Hobbits distant past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem glimpse time dwelt upper vales Anduin, eaves Greenwood Great Misty Mountains. Why later undertook hard perilous crossing mountains Eriador longer certain. Their accounts speak multiplying Men land, shadow fell forest, became darkened new name Mirkwood. Before crossing mountains Hobbits already become divided three somewhat different breeds: Harfoots, Stoors, Fallohides. The Harfoots browner skin, smaller, shorter, beardless bootless; hands feet neat nimble; preferred highlands hillsides. The Stoors broader, heavier build; feet hands larger; preferred flat lands riversides. The Fallohides fairer skin also hair, taller slimmer others; lovers trees woodlands. The Harfoots much Dwarves ancient times, long lived foothills mountains. They moved westward early, roamed Eriador far Weathertop others still Wilderland. They normal representative variety Hobbit, far numerous. They inclined settle one place, longest preserved ancestral habit living tunnels holes. The Stoors lingered long banks Great River Anduin, less shy Men. They came west Harfoots followed course Loudwater southwards; many long dwelt Tharbad borders Dunland moved north again. The Fallohides, least numerous, northerly branch. They friendly Elves Hobbits were, skill language song handicrafts; old preferred hunting tilling. They crossed mountains north Rivendell came River Hoarwell. In Eriador soon mingled kinds preceded them, somewhat bolder adventurous, often found leaders chieftains among clans Harfoots Stoors. Even Bilbo’s time strong Fallohidish strain could still noted among greater families, Tooks Masters Buckland. In westlands Eriador, Misty Mountains Mountains Lune, Hobbits found Men Elves. Indeed, remnant still dwelt Du´nedain, kings Men came Sea Westernesse; dwindling fast lands North Kingdom falling far wide waste. There room spare incomers, ere long Hobbits began settle ordered communities. Most earlier settlements long disappeared forgotten Bilbo’s time; one first become important still endured, though reduced size; Bree Chetwood lay round about, forty miles east Shire. It early days, doubtless, Hobbits learned letters began write manner Du´nedain, turn long learned art Elves. And days also forgot whatever languages used before, spoke ever Common Speech, Westron named, current lands kings Arnor Gondor, coasts Sea Belfalas Lune. Yet kept words own, well names months days, great store personal names past. About time legend among Hobbits first becomes history reckoning years. For one thousand six hundred first year Third Age Fallohide brothers, Marcho Blanco, set Bree; obtained permission high king Fornost,* crossed brown river Baranduin great following Hobbits. They passed Bridge Stonebows, built days power North Kingdom, took land beyond dwell in, river Far Downs. All * As records Gondor relate Argeleb II, twentieth Northern line, came end Arvedui three hundred years later. demanded keep Great Bridge repair, bridges roads, speed king’s messengers, acknowledge lordship. Thus began Shire-reckoning, year crossing Brandywine (as Hobbits turned name) became Year One Shire, later dates reckoned it.* At western Hobbits fell love new land, remained there, soon passed history Men Elves. While still king name subjects, were, fact, ruled chieftains meddled events world outside. To last battle Fornost Witch-lord Angmar sent bowmen aid king, maintained, though tales Men record it. But war North Kingdom ended; Hobbits took land own, chose chiefs Thain hold authority king gone. There thousand years little troubled wars, prospered multiplied Dark Plague (S.R. 37) disaster Long Winter famine followed it. Many thousands perished, Days Dearth (1158–60) time tale long past Hobbits become accustomed plenty. The land rich kindly, though long deserted entered it, well tilled, king many farms, cornlands, vineyards, woods. Forty leagues stretched Far Downs Brandywine Bridge, fifty northern moors marshes south. The Hobbits named Shire, region authority Thain, district well-ordered business; pleasant corner world plied well-ordered business living, * Thus, years Third Age reckoning Elves Du´nedain may found adding 1600 dates Shirereckoning. heeded less less world outside dark things moved, came think peace plenty rule Middle-earth right sensible folk. They forgot ignored little ever known Guardians, labours made possible long peace Shire. They were, fact, sheltered, ceased remember it. At time Hobbits kind warlike, never fought among themselves. In olden days had, course, often obliged fight maintain hard world; Bilbo’s time ancient history. The last battle, story opens, indeed one ever fought within borders Shire, beyond living memory: Battle Greenfields, S.R. 1147, Bandobras Took routed invasion Orcs. Even weathers grown milder, wolves come ravening North bitter white winters grandfather’s tale. So, though still store weapons Shire, used mostly trophies, hanging hearths walls, gathered museum Michel Delving. The Mathom-house called; anything Hobbits immediate use for, unwilling throw away, called mathom. Their dwellings apt become rather crowded mathoms, many presents passed hand hand sort. Nonetheless, ease peace left people still curiously tough. They were, came it, difficult daunt kill; were, perhaps, unwearyingly fond good things least could, put it, without them, could survive rough handling grief, foe, weather way astonished know well looked bellies well-fed faces. Though slow quarrel, sport killing nothing lived, doughty bay, need could still handle arms. They shot well bow, keen-eyed sure mark. Not bows arrows. If Hobbit stooped stone, well get quickly cover, trespassing beasts knew well. All Hobbits originally lived holes ground, believed, dwellings still felt home; course time obliged adopt forms abode. Actually Shire Bilbo’s days was, rule, richest poorest Hobbits maintained old custom. The poorest went living burrows primitive kind, mere holes indeed, one window none; well-to-do still constructed luxurious versions simple diggings old. But suitable sites large ramifying tunnels (or smials called them) everywhere found; flats low-lying districts Hobbits, multiplied, began build ground. Indeed, even hilly regions older villages, Hobbiton Tuckborough, chief township Shire, Michel Delving White Downs, many houses wood, brick, stone. These specially favoured millers, smiths, ropers, cartwrights, others sort; even holes live in, Hobbits long accustomed build sheds workshops. The habit building farmhouses barns said begun among inhabitants Marish Brandywine. The Hobbits quarter, Eastfarthing, rather large heavy-legged, wore dwarf-boots muddy weather. But well known Stoors large part blood, indeed shown many grew chins. No Harfoot Fallohide trace beard. Indeed, folk Marish, Buckland, east River, afterwards occupied, came part later Shire south-away; still many peculiar names strange words found elsewhere Shire. It probable craft building, many crafts beside, derived Du´nedain. But Hobbits may learned direct Elves, teachers Men youth. For Elves High Kindred yet forsaken Middle-earth, dwelt still time Grey Havens away west, places within reach Shire. Three Elf-towers immemorial age still seen Tower Hills beyond western marches. They shone far moonlight. The tallest furthest away, standing alone upon green mound. The Hobbits Westfarthing said one could see Sea top tower; Hobbit ever known climb it. Indeed, Hobbits ever seen sailed upon Sea, fewer still ever returned report it. Most Hobbits regarded even rivers small boats deep misgivings, many could swim. And days Shire lengthened spoke less less Elves, grew afraid them, distrustful dealings them; Sea became word fear among them, token death, turned faces away hills west. The craft building may come Elves Men, Hobbits used fashion. They go towers. Their houses usually long, low, comfortable. The oldest kind were, indeed, built imitations smials, thatched dry grass straw, roofed turves, walls somewhat bulged. That stage, however, belonged early days Shire, hobbit-building long since altered, improved devices, learned Dwarves, discovered themselves. A preference round windows, even round doors, chief remaining peculiarity hobbit-architecture. The houses holes Shire-hobbits often large, inhabited large families. (Bilbo Frodo Baggins bachelors exceptional, also many ways, friendship Elves.) Sometimes, case Tooks Great Smials, Brandybucks Brandy Hall, many generations relatives lived (comparative) peace together one ancestral many-tunnelled mansion. All Hobbits were, case, clannish reckoned relationships great care. They drew long elaborate family-trees innumerable branches. In dealing Hobbits important remember related whom, degree. It would impossible book set family-tree included even important members important families time tales tell of. The genealogical trees end Red Book Westmarch small book themselves, Hobbits would find exceedinglydull.Hobbitsdelightedinsuchthings,iftheywere accurate: liked books filled things already knew, set fair square contradictions. 2 Concerning Pipe-weed There another astonishing thing Hobbits old must mentioned, astonishing habit: imbibed inhaled, pipes clay wood, smoke burning leaves herb, called pipe-weed leaf, variety probably Nicotiana. A great deal mystery surrounds origin peculiar custom, ‘art’ Hobbits preferred call it. All could discovered antiquity put together Meriadoc Brandybuck (later Master Buckland), since tobacco Southfarthing play part history follows, remarks introduction Herblore Shire may quoted. ‘This,’ says, ‘is one art certainly claim invention. When Hobbits first began smoke known, legends family histories take granted; ages folk Shire smoked various herbs, fouler, sweeter. But accounts agree Tobold Hornblower Longbottom Southfarthing first grew true pipe-weed gardens days Isengrim Second, year 1070 Shire-reckoning. The best home-grown still comes district, especially varieties known Longbottom Leaf, Old Toby, Southern Star. ‘How Old Toby came plant recorded, dying day would tell. He knew much herbs, traveller. It said youth went often Bree, though certainly never went Shire that. It thus quite possible learned plant Bree, now, rate, grows well south slopes hill. The Bree-hobbits claim first actual smokers pipe-weed. They claim, course, done everything people Shire, refer ‘‘colonists’’; case claim is, I think, likely true. And certainly Bree art smoking genuine weed spread recent centuries among Dwarves folk, Rangers, Wizards, wanderers, still passed fro ancient road-meeting. The home centre art thus found old inn Bree, The Prancing Pony, kept family Butterbur time beyond record. ‘All same, observations I made many journeys south convinced weed native parts world, came northward lower Anduin, whither was, I suspect, originally brought Sea Men Westernesse. It grows abundantly Gondor, richer larger North, never found wild, flourishes warm sheltered places like Longbottom. The Men Gondor call sweet galenas, esteem fragrance flowers. From land must carried Greenway long centuries coming Elendil days. But even Du´nedain Gondor allow us credit: Hobbits first put pipes. Not even Wizards first thought did. Though one Wizard I knew took art long ago, became skilful things put mind to.’ 3 Of Ordering Shire The Shire divided four quarters, Farthings already referred to, North, South, East, West; number folklands, still bore names old leading families, although time history names longer found proper folklands. Nearly Tooks still lived Tookland, true many families, Bagginses Boffins. Outside Farthings East West Marches: Buckland (p. 129); Westmarch added Shire S.R. 1452. The Shire time hardly ‘government’. Families part managed affairs. Growing food eating occupied time. In matters were, rule, generous greedy, contented moderate, estates, farms, workshops, small trades tended remain unchanged generations. There remained, course, ancient tradition concerning high king Fornost, Norbury called it, away north Shire. But king nearly thousand years, even ruins Kings’ Norbury covered grass. Yet Hobbits still said wild folk wicked things (such trolls) heard king. For attributed king old essential laws; usually kept laws free will, The Rules (as said), ancient just. It true Took family long pre-eminent; office Thain passed (from Oldbucks) centuries before, chief Took borne title ever since. The Thain master Shiremoot, captain Shire-muster Hobbitry-inarms; muster moot held times emergency, longer occurred, Thainship ceased nominal dignity. The Took family still, indeed, accorded special respect, remained numerous exceedingly wealthy, liable produce every generation strong characters peculiar habits even adventurous temperament. The latter qualities, however, rather tolerated (in rich) generally approved. The custom endured, nonetheless, referring head family The Took, adding name, required, number: Isengrim Second, instance. The real official Shire date Mayor Michel Delving (or Shire), elected every seven years Free Fair White Downs Lithe, Midsummer. As mayor almost duty preside banquets, given Shire-holidays, occurred frequent intervals. But offices Postmaster First Shirriff attached mayoralty, managed Messenger Service Watch. These Shire-services, Messengers numerous, much busier two. By means Hobbits lettered, wrote constantly friends (and selection relations) lived afternoon’s walk. The Shirriffs name Hobbits gave police, nearest equivalent possessed. They had, course, uniforms (such things quite unknown), feather caps; practice rather haywards policemen, concerned strayings beasts people. There Shire twelve them, three Farthing, Inside Work. A rather larger body, varying need, employed ‘beat bounds’, see Outsiders kind, great small, make nuisance. At time story begins Bounders, called, greatly increased. There many reports complaints strange persons creatures prowling borders, them: first sign quite be, always except tales legends long ago. Few heeded sign, even Bilbo yet notion portended. Sixty years passed since set memorable journey, old even Hobbits, reached hundred often not; much evidently still remained considerable wealth brought back. How much little revealed one, even Frodo favourite ‘nephew’. And still kept secret ring found. 4 Of Finding Ring As told The Hobbit, came one day Bilbo’s door great Wizard, Gandalf Grey, thirteen dwarves him: none other, indeed, Thorin Oakenshield, descendant kings, twelve companions exile. With set out, lasting astonishment, morning April, year 1341 Shire-reckoning, quest great treasure, dwarf-hoards Kings Mountain, beneath Erebor Dale, far East. The quest successful, Dragon guarded hoard destroyed. Yet, though Battle Five Armies fought, Thorin slain, many deeds renown done, matter would scarcely concerned later history, earned note long annals Third Age, ‘accident’ way. The party assailed Orcs high pass Misty Mountains went towards Wilderland; happened Bilbo lost black orcmines deep mountains, there, groped vain dark, put hand ring, lying floor tunnel. He put pocket. It seemed like mere luck. Trying find way out, Bilbo went roots mountains, could go further. At bottom tunnel lay cold lake far light, island rock water lived Gollum. He loathsome little creature: paddled small boat large flat feet, peering pale luminous eyes catching blind fish long fingers, eating raw. He ate living thing, even orc, could catch strangle without struggle. He possessed secret treasure come long ages ago, still lived light: ring gold made wearer invisible. It one thing loved, ‘Precious’, talked it, even him. For kept hidden safe hole island, except hunting spying orcs mines. Maybe would attacked Bilbo once, ring met; not, hobbit held hand Elvish knife, served sword. So gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo Riddle-game, saying asked riddle Bilbo could guess, would kill eat him; Bilbo defeated him, would Bilbo wished: would lead way tunnels. Since lost dark without hope, could neither go back, Bilbo accepted challenge; asked one another many riddles. In end Bilbo game, luck (as seemed) wits; stumped last riddle ask, cried out, hand came upon ring picked forgotten: What I got pocket? This Gollum failed answer, though demanded three guesses. The Authorities, true, differ whether last question mere ‘question’ ‘riddle’ according strict rules Game; agree that, accepting trying guess answer, Gollum bound promise. And Bilbo pressed keep word; thought came slimy creature might prove false, even though promises held sacred, old wickedest things feared break them. But ages alone dark Gollum’s heart black, treachery it. He slipped away, returned island, Bilbo knew nothing, far dark water. There, thought, lay ring. He hungry now, angry, ‘Precious’ would fear weapon all. But ring island; lost it, gone. His screech sent shiver Bilbo’s back, though yet understand happened. But Gollum last leaped guess, late. What got pocketses? cried. The light eyes like green flame sped back murder hobbit recover ‘Precious’. Just time Bilbo saw peril, fled blindly passage away water; saved luck. For ran put hand pocket, ring slipped quietly finger. So Gollum passed without seeing him, went guard way out, lest ‘thief’ escape. Warily Bilbo followed him, went along, cursing, talking ‘Precious’; talk last even Bilbo guessed truth, hope came darkness: found marvellous ring chance escape orcs Gollum. At length came halt unseen opening led lower gates mines, eastward side mountains. There Gollum crouched bay, smelling listening; Bilbo tempted slay sword. But pity stayed him, though kept ring, hope lay, would use help kill wretched creature disadvantage. In end, gathering courage, leaped Gollum dark, fled away passage, pursued enemy’s cries hate despair: Thief, thief! Baggins! We hates ever! Now curious fact story Bilbo first told companions. To account Gollum promised give present, game; Gollum went fetch island found treasure gone: magic ring, given long ago birthday. Bilbo guessed ring found, game, already right. But tight place, said nothing it, made Gollum show way out, reward instead present. This account Bilbo set memoirs, seems never altered himself, even Council Elrond. Evidently still appeared original Red Book, several copies abstracts. But many copies contain true account (as alternative), derived doubt notes Frodo Samwise, learned truth, though seem unwilling delete anything actually written old hobbit himself. Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo’s first story, soon heard it, continued curious ring. Eventually got true tale Bilbo much questioning, strained friendship; wizard seemed think truth important. Though say Bilbo, also thought important, disturbing, find good hobbit told truth first: quite contrary habit. The idea ‘present’ mere hobbitlike invention, same. It suggested Bilbo, confessed, Gollum’s talk overheard; Gollum did, fact, call ring ‘birthday-present’, many times. That also Gandalf thought strange suspicious; discover truth point many years, seen book. Of Bilbo’s later adventures little need said here. With help ring escaped orc-guards gate rejoined companions. He used ring many times quest, chiefly help friends; kept secret long could. After return home never spoke anyone, save Gandalf Frodo; one else Shire knew existence, believed. Only Frodo show account Journey writing. His sword, Sting, Bilbo hung fireplace, coat marvellous mail, gift Dwarves Dragon-hoard, lent museum, Michel Delving Mathom-house fact. But kept drawer Bag End old cloak hood worn travels; ring, secured fine chain, remained pocket. He returned home Bag End June 22nd fifty-second year (S.R. 1342), nothing notable occurred Shire Mr. Baggins began preparations celebration hundred-and-eleventh birthday (S.R. 1401). At point History begins. note shire records At end Third Age part played Hobbits great events led inclusion Shire Reunited Kingdom awakened among widespread interest history; many traditions, time still mainly oral, collected written down. The greater families also concerned events Kingdom large, many members studied ancient histories legends. By end first century Fourth Age already found Shire several libraries contained many historical books records. The largest collections probably Undertowers, Great Smials, Brandy Hall. This account end Third Age drawn mainly Red Book Westmarch. That important source history War Ring called long preserved Undertowers, home Fairbairns, Wardens Westmarch.* It origin Bilbo’s private diary, took Rivendell. Frodo brought back Shire, together many loose leaves notes, S.R. 1420–1 nearly filled pages account War. But annexed preserved it, probably single red case, three large volumes, bound red leather, Bilbo gave parting gift. To four volumes added Westmarch fifth containing commentaries, genealogies, various matter concerning hobbit members Fellowship. The original Red Book preserved, many copies made, especially first volume, use descendants children Master Samwise. The important copy, however, different history. It kept Great Smials, written Gondor, probably request great-grandson Peregrin, completed S.R. 1592 (F.A. 172). Its southern scribe appended note: Findegil, King’s Writer, finished work IV 172. It exact copy details Thain’s Book Minas Tirith. That book copy, made request King Elessar, Red Book Periannath, brought Thain Peregrin retired Gondor IV 64. The Thain’s Book thus first copy made Red Book contained much later omitted lost. In Minas Tirith received much annotation, many corrections, especially names, words, quotations Elvish languages; added abbreviated version parts The Tale Aragorn Arwen lie outside account War. The full tale stated written Barahir, grandson Steward Faramir, time passing King. But chief importance Findegil’s copy alone contains whole Bilbo’s ‘Translations Elvish’. These three volumes * See Appendix B: annals 1451, 1462, 1482; note end Appendix C. found work great skill learning which, 1403 1418, used sources available Rivendell, living written. But since little used Frodo, almost entirely concerned Elder Days, said here. Since Meriadoc Peregrin became heads great families, time kept connexions Rohan Gondor, libraries Bucklebury Tuckborough contained much appear Red Book. In Brandy Hall many works dealing Eriador history Rohan. Some composed begun Meriadoc himself, though Shire chiefly remembered Herblore Shire, Reckoning Years discussed relation calendars Shire Bree Rivendell, Gondor, Rohan. He also wrote short treatise Old Words Names Shire, showing special interest discovering kinship language Rohirrim ‘shire-words’ mathom old elements place names. At Great Smials books less interest Shirefolk, though important larger history. None written Peregrin, successors collected many manuscripts written scribes Gondor: mainly copies summaries histories legends relating Elendil heirs.

Chapter 1 A LONG-EXPECTED PARTY When Mr. Bilbo Baggins Bag End announced would shortly celebrating eleventy-first birthday party special magnificence, much talk excitement Hobbiton. Bilbo rich peculiar, wonder Shire sixty years, ever since remarkable disappearance unexpected return. The riches brought back travels become local legend, popularly believed, whatever old folk might say, Hill Bag End full tunnels stuffed treasure. And enough fame, also prolonged vigour marvel at. Time wore on, seemed little effect Mr. Baggins. At ninety much fifty. At ninety-nine began call well-preserved; unchanged would nearer mark. There shook heads thought much good thing; seemed unfair anyone possess (apparently) perpetual youth well (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth. ‘It paid for,’ said. ‘It isn’t natural, trouble come it!’ But far trouble come; Mr. Baggins generous money, people willing forgive oddities good fortune. He remained visiting terms relatives (except, course, Sackville-Bagginses), many devoted admirers among hobbits poor unimportant families. But close friends, younger cousins began grow up. The eldest these, Bilbo’s favourite, young Frodo Baggins. When Bilbo ninety-nine adopted Frodo heir, brought live Bag End; hopes Sackville-Bagginses finally dashed. Bilbo Frodo happened birthday, September 22nd. ‘You better come live here, Frodo lad,’ said Bilbo one day; ‘and celebrate birthday-parties comfortably together.’ At time Frodo still tweens, hobbits called irresponsible twenties childhood coming age thirty-three. Twelve years passed. Each year Bagginses given lively combined birthday-parties Bag End; understood something quite exceptional planned autumn. Bilbo going eleventy-one, 111, rather curious number, respectable age hobbit (the Old Took reached 130); Frodo going thirty-three, 33, important number: date ‘coming age’. Tongues began wag Hobbiton Bywater; rumour coming event travelled Shire. The history character Mr. Bilbo Baggins became chief topic conversation; older folk suddenly found reminiscences welcome demand. No one attentive audience old Ham Gamgee, commonly known Gaffer. He held forth The Ivy Bush, small inn Bywater road; spoke authority, tended garden Bag End forty years, helped old Holman job that. Now growing old stiff joints, job mainly carried youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father son friendly terms Bilbo Frodo. They lived Hill itself, Number 3 Bagshot Row Bag End. ‘A nice well-spoken gentlehobbit Mr. Bilbo, I’ve always said,’ Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: Bilbo polite him, calling ‘Master Hamfast’, consulting constantly upon growing vegetables – matter ‘roots’, especially potatoes, Gaffer recognized leading authority neighbourhood (including himself). ‘But Frodo lives him?’ asked Old Noakes Bywater. ‘Baggins name, he’s half Brandybuck, say. It beats Baggins Hobbiton go looking wife away Buckland, folks queer.’ ‘And wonder they’re queer,’ put Daddy Twofoot (the Gaffer’s next-door neighbour), ‘if live wrong side Brandywine River, right agin Old Forest. That’s dark bad place, half tales true.’ ‘You’re right, Dad!’ said Gaffer. ‘Not Brandybucks Buckland live Old Forest; they’re queer breed, seemingly. They fool boats big river – isn’t natural. Small wonder trouble came it, I say. But may, Mr. Frodo nice young hobbit could wish meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, looks. After father Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit Mr. Drogo Baggins; never much tell him, till drownded.’ ‘Drownded?’ said several voices. They heard darker rumours before, course; hobbits passion family history, ready hear again. ‘Well, say,’ said Gaffer. ‘You see: Mr. Drogo, married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She Mr. Bilbo’s first cousin mother’s side (her mother youngest Old Took’s daughters); Mr. Drogo second cousin. So Mr. Frodo first second cousin, removed either way, saying is, follow me. And Mr. Drogo staying Brandy Hall father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, often marriage (him partial vittles, old Gorbadoc keeping mighty generous table); went boating Brandywine River; wife drownded, poor Mr. Frodo child all.’ ‘I’ve heard went water dinner moonlight,’ said Old Noakes; ‘and Drogo’s weight sunk boat.’ ‘And I heard pushed in, pulled him,’ said Sandyman, Hobbiton miller. ‘You shouldn’t listen hear, Sandyman,’ said Gaffer, much like miller. ‘There isn’t call go talking pushing pulling. Boats quite tricky enough sit still without looking cause trouble. Anyway: Mr. Frodo left orphan stranded, might say, among queer Bucklanders, brought anyhow Brandy Hall. A regular warren, accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never fewer couple hundred relations place. Mr. Bilbo never kinder deed brought lad back live among decent folk. ‘But I reckon nasty knock SackvilleBagginses. They thought going get Bag End, time went thought dead. And comes back orders off; goes living living, never looking day older, bless him! And suddenly produces heir, papers made proper. The Sackville-Bagginses won’t never see inside Bag End now, hoped not.’ ‘There’s tidy bit money tucked away there, I hear tell,’ said stranger, visitor business Michel Delving Westfarthing. ‘All top hill full tunnels packed chests gold silver, jools, I’ve heard.’ ‘Then you’ve heard I speak to,’ answered Gaffer. ‘I know nothing jools. Mr. Bilbo free money, seems lack it; I know tunnel-making. I saw Mr. Bilbo came back, matter sixty years ago, I lad. I’d long come prentice old Holman (him dad’s cousin), Bag End helping keep folks trampling trapessing garden sale on. And middle Mr. Bilbo comes Hill pony mighty big bags couple chests. I don’t doubt mostly full treasure picked foreign parts, mountains gold, say; wasn’t enough fill tunnels. But lad Sam know that. He’s Bag End. Crazy stories old days, is, listens Mr. Bilbo’s tales. Mr. Bilbo learned letters – meaning harm, mark you, I hope harm come it. ‘Elves Dragons! I says him. Cabbages potatoes better you. Don’t go getting mixed business betters, you’ll land trouble big you, I says him. And I might say others,’ added look stranger miller. But Gaffer convince audience. The legend Bilbo’s wealth firmly fixed minds younger generation hobbits. ‘Ah, likely enough adding brought first,’ argued miller, voicing common opinion. ‘He’s often away home. And look outlandish folk thatvisithim:dwarvescomingatnight,andthatoldwandering conjuror, Gandalf, all. You say like, Gaffer, Bag End’s queer place, folk queerer.’ ‘And say like, know boating, Mr. Sandyman,’ retorted Gaffer, disliking miller even usual. ‘If that’s queer, could bit queerness parts. There’s far away wouldn’t offer pint beer friend, lived hole golden walls. But things proper Bag End. Our Sam says everyone’s going invited party, there’s going presents, mark you, presents – month is.’ * * * That month September, fine could ask. A day two later rumour (probably started knowledgeable Sam) spread going fireworks – fireworks, more, seen Shire nigh century, indeed since Old Took died. Days passed The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon laden odd-looking packages rolled Hobbiton one evening toiled Hill Bag End. The startled hobbits peered lamplit doors gape it. It driven outlandish folk, singing strange songs: dwarves long beards deep hoods. A remained Bag End. At end second week September cart came Bywater direction Brandywine Bridge broad daylight. An old man driving alone. He wore tall pointed blue hat, long grey cloak, silver scarf. He long white beard bushy eyebrows stuck beyond brim hat. Small hobbitchildren ran cart Hobbiton right hill. It cargo fireworks, rightly guessed. At Bilbo’s front door old man began unload: great bundles fireworks sorts shapes, labelled large red G elf-rune, . That Gandalf’s mark, course, old man Gandalf Wizard, whose fame Shire due mainly skill fires, smokes, lights. His real business far difficult dangerous, Shire-folk knew nothing it. To one ‘attractions’ Party. Hence excitement hobbit-children. ‘G Grand!’ shouted, old man smiled. They knew sight, though appeared Hobbiton occasionally never stopped long; neither oldest elders seen one firework displays – belonged legendary past. When old man, helped Bilbo dwarves, finished unloading, Bilbo gave pennies away; single squib cracker forthcoming, disappointment onlookers. ‘Run away now!’ said Gandalf. ‘You get plenty time comes.’ Then disappeared inside Bilbo, door shut. The young hobbits stared door vain while, made off, feeling day party would never come. Inside Bag End, Bilbo Gandalf sitting open window small room looking west garden. The late afternoon bright peaceful. The flowers glowed red golden: snap-dragons sunflowers, nasturtians trailing turf walls peeping round windows. ‘How bright garden looks!’ said Gandalf. ‘Yes,’ said Bilbo. ‘I fond indeed it, dear old Shire; I think I need holiday.’ ‘You mean go plan then?’ ‘I do. I made mind months ago, I haven’t changed it.’ ‘Very well. It good saying more. Stick plan – whole plan, mind – I hope turn best, you, us.’ ‘I hope so. Anyway I mean enjoy Thursday, little joke.’ ‘Who laugh, I wonder?’ said Gandalf, shaking head. ‘We shall see,’ said Bilbo. The next day carts rolled Hill, still carts. There might grumbling ‘dealing locally’, week orders began pour Bag End every kind provision, commodity, luxury could obtained Hobbiton Bywater anywhere neighbourhood. People became enthusiastic; began tick days calendar; watched eagerly postman, hoping invitations. Before long invitations began pouring out, Hobbiton post-office blocked, Bywater postoffice snowed under, voluntary assistant postmen called for. There constant stream going Hill, carrying hundreds polite variations Thank you, I shall certainly come. A notice appeared gate Bag End: admittance except party business. Even had, pretended Party Business seldom allowed inside. Bilbo busy: writing invitations, ticking answers, packing presents, making private preparations own. From time Gandalf’s arrival remained hidden view. One morning hobbits woke find large field, south Bilbo’s front door, covered ropes poles tents pavilions. A special entrance cut bank leading road, wide steps large white gate built there. The three hobbit-families Bagshot Row, adjoining field, intensely interested generally envied. Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending work garden. The tents began go up. There specially large pavilion, big tree grew field right inside it, stood proudly near one end, head chief table. Lanterns hung branches. More promising still (to hobbits’ mind): enormous open-air kitchen erected north corner field. A draught cooks, every inn eating-house miles around, arrived supplement dwarves odd folk quartered Bag End. Excitement rose height. Then weather clouded over. That Wednesday eve Party. Anxiety intense. Then Thursday, September 22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, clouds vanished, flags unfurled fun began. Bilbo Baggins called party, really variety entertainments rolled one. Practically everybody living near invited. A overlooked accident, turned same, matter. Many people parts Shire also asked; even outside borders. Bilbo met guests (and additions) new white gate person. He gave away presents sundry – latter went back way came gate. Hobbits give presents people birthdays. Not expensive ones, rule, lavishly occasion; bad system. Actually Hobbiton Bywater every day year somebody’s birthday, every hobbit parts fair chance least one present least week. But never got tired them. On occasion presents unusually good. The hobbit-children excited almost forgot eating. There toys like never seen before, beautiful obviously magical. Many indeed ordered year before, come way Mountain Dale, real dwarf-make. When every guest welcomed finally inside gate, songs, dances, music, games, and, course, food drink. There three official meals: lunch, tea, dinner (or supper). But lunch tea marked chiefly fact times guests sitting eating together. At times merely lots people eating drinking – continuously elevenses six-thirty, fireworks started. The fireworks Gandalf: brought him, designed made him; special effects, set pieces, flights rockets let him. But also generous distribution squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles, elffountains, goblin-barkers thunder-claps. They superb. The art Gandalf improved age. There rockets like flight scintillating birds singing sweet voices. There green trees trunks dark smoke: leaves opened like whole spring unfolding moment, shining branches dropped glowing flowers upon astonished hobbits, disappearing sweet scent touched upturned faces. There fountains butterflies flew glittering trees; pillars coloured fires rose turned eagles, sailing ships, phalanx flying swans; red thunderstorm shower yellow rain; forest silver spears sprang suddenly air yell like embattled army, came Water hiss like hundred hot snakes. And also one last surprise, honour Bilbo, startled hobbits exceedingly, Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shaped like mountain seen distance, began glow summit. It spouted green scarlet flames. Out flew red-golden dragon – life-size, terribly life-like: fire came jaws, eyes glared down; roar, whizzed three times heads crowd. They ducked, many fell flat faces. The dragon passed like express train, turned somersault, burst Bywater deafening explosion. ‘That signal supper!’ said Bilbo. The pain alarm vanished once, prostrate hobbits leaped feet. There splendid supper everyone; everyone, is, except invited special family dinner-party. This held great pavilion tree. The invitations limited twelve dozen (a number also called hobbits one Gross, though word considered proper use people); guests selected families Bilbo Frodo related, addition special unrelated friends (such Gandalf). Many young hobbits included, present parental permission; hobbits easy-going children matter sitting late, especially chance getting free meal. Bringing young hobbits took lot provender. There many Bagginses Boffins, also many Tooks Brandybucks; various Grubbs (relations Bilbo Baggins’ grandmother), various Chubbs (connexions Took grandfather); selection Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brockhouses, Goodbodies, Hornblowers Proudfoots. Some distantly connected Bilbo, hardly ever Hobbiton before, lived remote corners Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses forgotten. Otho wife Lobelia present. They disliked Bilbo detested Frodo, magnificent invitation card, written golden ink, felt impossible refuse. Besides, cousin, Bilbo, specializing food many years table high reputation. All one hundred forty-four guests expected pleasant feast; though rather dreaded after-dinner speech host (an inevitable item). He liable drag bits called poetry; sometimes, glass two, would allude absurd adventures mysterious journey. The guests disappointed: pleasant feast, fact engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied, prolonged. The purchase provisions fell almost nothing throughout district ensuing weeks; Bilbo’s catering depleted stocks stores, cellars warehouses miles around, matter much. After feast (more less) came Speech. Most company were, however, tolerant mood, delightful stage called ‘filling corners’. They sipping favourite drinks, nibbling favourite dainties, fears forgotten. They prepared listen anything, cheer every full stop. My dear People, began Bilbo, rising place. ‘Hear! Hear! Hear!’ shouted, kept repeating chorus, seeming reluctant follow advice. Bilbo left place went stood chair illuminated tree. The light lanterns fell beaming face; golden buttons shone embroidered silk waistcoat. They could see standing, waving one hand air, trouser-pocket. My dear Bagginses Boffins, began again; dear Tooks Brandybucks, Grubbs, Chubbs, Burrowses, Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses Proudfoots. ‘Proudfeet!’ shouted elderly hobbit back pavilion. His name, course, Proudfoot, well merited; feet large, exceptionally furry, table. Proudfoots, repeated Bilbo. Also good Sackville-Bagginses I welcome back last Bag End. Today one hundred eleventh birthday: I eleventy-one today! ‘Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy Returns!’ shouted, hammered joyously tables. Bilbo splendidly. This sort stuff liked: short obvious. I hope enjoying much I am. Deafening cheers. Cries Yes (and No). Noises trumpets horns, pipes flutes, musical instruments. There were, said, many young hobbits present. Hundreds musical crackers pulled. Most bore mark dale them; convey much hobbits, agreed marvellous crackers. They contained instruments, small, perfect make enchanting tones. Indeed, one corner young Tooks Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo finished (since plainly said necessary), got impromptu orchestra, began merry dance-tune. Master Everard Took Miss Melilot Brandybuck got table bells hands began dance Springle-ring: pretty dance, rather vigorous. But Bilbo finished. Seizing horn youngster nearby, blew three loud hoots. The noise subsided. I shall keep long, cried. Cheers assembly. I called together Purpose. Something way said made impression. There almost silence, one two Tooks pricked ears. Indeed, Three Purposes! First all, tell I immensely fond all, eleventy-one years short time live among excellent admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst approval. I don’t know half half well I like; I like less half half well deserve. This unexpected rather difficult. There scattered clapping, trying work see came compliment. Secondly, celebrate birthday. Cheers again. I say: OUR birthday. For is, course, also birthday heir nephew, Frodo. He comes age inheritance today. Some perfunctory clapping elders; loud shouts ‘Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old Frodo,’ juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, wondered meant ‘coming inheritance’. Together score one hundred forty-four. Your numbers chosen fit remarkable total: One Gross, I may use expression. No cheers. This ridiculous. Many guests, especially Sackville-Bagginses, insulted, feeling sure asked fill required number, like goods package. ‘One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.’ It also, I may allowed refer ancient history, anniversary arrival barrel Esgaroth Long Lake; though fact birthday slipped memory occasion. I fifty-one then, birthdays seem important. The banquet splendid, however, though I bad cold time, I remember, could say ‘thag buch’. I repeat correctly: Thank much coming little party. Obstinate silence. They feared song poetry imminent; getting bored. Why couldn’t stop talking let drink health? But Bilbo sing recite. He paused moment. Thirdly finally, said, I wish make ANNOUNCEMENT. He spoke last word loudly suddenly everyone sat still could. I regret announce – though, I said, eleventy-one years far short time spend among – END. I going. I leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE! He stepped vanished. There blinding flash light, guests blinked. When opened eyes Bilbo nowhere seen. One hundred fortyfour flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo Proudfoot removed feet table stamped. Then dead silence, suddenly, several deep breaths, every Baggins, Boffin, Took, Brandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, Proudfoot began talk once. It generally agreed joke bad taste, food drink needed cure guests shock annoyance. ‘He’s mad. I always said so,’ probably popular comment. Even Tooks (with exceptions) thought Bilbo’s behaviour absurd. For moment took granted disappearance nothing ridiculous prank. But old Rory Brandybuck sure. Neither age enormous dinner clouded wits, said daughter-in-law, Esmeralda: ‘There’s something fishy this, dear! I believe mad Baggins again. Silly old fool. But worry? He hasn’t taken vittles him.’ He called loudly Frodo send wine round again. Frodo one present said nothing. For time sat silent beside Bilbo’s empty chair, ignored remarks questions. He enjoyed joke, course, even though know. He difficulty keeping laughter indignant surprise guests. But time felt deeply troubled: realized suddenly loved old hobbit dearly. Most guests went eating drinking discussing Bilbo Baggins’ oddities, past present; SackvilleBagginses already departed wrath. Frodo want party. He gave orders wine served; got drained glass silently health Bilbo, slipped pavilion. As Bilbo Baggins, even making speech, fingering golden ring pocket: magic ring kept secret many years. As stepped slipped finger, never seen hobbit Hobbiton again. He walked briskly back hole, stood moment listening smile din pavilion, sounds merrymaking parts field. Then went in. He took party clothes, folded wrapped tissue-paper embroidered silk waistcoat, put away. Then put quickly old untidy garments, fastened round waist worn leather belt. On hung short sword battered black-leather scabbard. From locked drawer, smelling moth-balls, took old cloak hood. They locked precious, patched weatherstained original colour could hardly guessed: might dark green. They rather large him. He went study, large strong-box took bundle wrapped old cloths, leather-bound manuscript; also large bulky envelope. The book bundle stuffed top heavy bag standing there, already nearly full. Into envelope slipped golden ring, fine chain, sealed it, addressed Frodo. At first put mantelpiece, suddenly removed stuck pocket. At moment door opened Gandalf came quickly in. ‘Hullo!’ said Bilbo. ‘I wondered would turn up.’ ‘I glad find visible,’ replied wizard, sitting chair, ‘I wanted catch final words. I suppose feel everything gone splendidly according plan?’ ‘Yes, I do,’ said Bilbo. ‘Though flash surprising: quite startled me, let alone others. A little addition own, I suppose?’ ‘It was. You wisely kept ring secret years, seemed necessary give guests something else would seem explain sudden vanishment.’ ‘And would spoil joke. You interfering old busybody,’ laughed Bilbo, ‘but I expect know best, usual.’ ‘I – I know anything. But I don’t feel sure whole affair. It come final point. You joke, alarmed offended relations, given whole Shire something talk nine days, ninety-nine likely. Are going further?’ ‘Yes, I am. I feel I need holiday, long holiday, I told before. Probably permanent holiday: I don’t expect I shall return. In fact, I don’t mean to, I made arrangements. ‘I old, Gandalf. I don’t look it, I beginning feel heart hearts. Well-preserved indeed!’ snorted. ‘Why, I feel thin, sort stretched, know I mean: like butter scraped much bread. That can’t right. I need change, something.’ Gandalf looked curiously closely him. ‘No, seem right,’ said thoughtfully. ‘No, I believe plan probably best.’ ‘Well, I’ve made mind, anyway. I want see mountains again, Gandalf – mountains; find somewhere I rest. In peace quiet, without lot relatives prying around, string confounded visitors hanging bell. I might find somewhere I finish book. I thought nice ending it: lived happily ever end days.’ Gandalf laughed. ‘I hope will. But nobody read book, however ends.’ ‘Oh, may, years come. Frodo read already, far gone. You’ll keep eye Frodo, won’t you?’ ‘Yes, I – two eyes, often I spare them.’ ‘He would come me, course, I asked him. In fact offered once, party. But really want to, yet. I want see wild country I die, Mountains; still love Shire, woods fields little rivers. He ought comfortable here. I leaving everything him, course, except oddments. I hope happy, gets used own. It’s time master now.’ ‘Everything?’ said Gandalf. ‘The ring well? You agreed that, remember.’ ‘Well, er, yes, I suppose so,’ stammered Bilbo. ‘Where it?’ ‘In envelope, must know,’ said Bilbo impatiently. ‘There mantelpiece. Well, no! Here pocket!’ He hesitated. ‘Isn’t odd now?’ said softly himself. ‘Yet all, not? Why shouldn’t stay there?’ Gandalf looked hard Bilbo, gleam eyes. ‘I think, Bilbo,’ said quietly, ‘I leave behind. Don’t want to?’ ‘Well yes – no. Now comes it, I don’t like parting all, I may say. And I don’t really see I should. Why want to?’ asked, curious change came voice. It sharp suspicion annoyance. ‘You always badgering ring; never bothered things I got journey.’ ‘No, I badger you,’ said Gandalf. ‘I wanted truth. It important. Magic rings – well, magical; rare curious. I professionally interested ring, may say; I still am. I like know is, go wandering again. Also I think quite long enough. You won’t need more, Bilbo, unless I quite mistaken.’ Bilbo flushed, angry light eyes. His kindly face grew hard. ‘Why not?’ cried. ‘And business yours, anyway, know I things? It own. I found it. It came me.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ said Gandalf. ‘But need get angry.’ ‘If I fault,’ said Bilbo. ‘It mine, I tell you. My own. My Precious. Yes, Precious.’ The wizard’s face remained grave attentive, flicker deep eyes showed startled indeed alarmed. ‘It called before,’ said, ‘but you.’ ‘But I say now. And not? Even Gollum said once. It’s now, mine. And I shall keep it, I say.’ Gandalf stood up. He spoke sternly. ‘You fool do, Bilbo,’ said. ‘You make clearer every word say. It got far much hold you. Let go! And go yourself, free.’ ‘I’ll I choose go I please,’ said Bilbo obstinately. ‘Now, now, dear hobbit!’ said Gandalf. ‘All long life friends, owe something. Come! Do promised: give up!’ ‘Well, want ring yourself, say so!’ cried Bilbo. ‘But won’t get it. I won’t give Precious away, I tell you.’ His hand strayed hilt small sword. Gandalf’s eyes flashed. ‘It turn get angry soon,’ said. ‘If say again, I shall. Then see Gandalf Grey uncloaked.’ He took step towards hobbit, seemed grow tall menacing; shadow filled little room. Bilbo backed away wall, breathing hard, hand clutching pocket. They stood facing one another, air room tingled. Gandalf’s eyes remained bent hobbit. Slowly hands relaxed, began tremble. ‘I don’t know come you, Gandalf,’ said. ‘You never like before. What about? It mine isn’t it? I found it, Gollum would killed me, I hadn’t kept it. I’m thief, whatever said.’ ‘I never called one,’ Gandalf answered. ‘And I one either. I trying rob you, help you. I wish would trust me, used.’ He turned away, shadow passed. He seemed dwindle old grey man, bent troubled. Bilbo drew hand eyes. ‘I sorry,’ said. ‘But I felt queer. And yet would relief way bothered more. It growing mind lately. Sometimes I felt like eye looking me. And I always wanting put disappear, don’t know; wondering safe, pulling make sure. I tried locking up, I found I couldn’t rest without pocket. I don’t know why. And I don’t seem able make mind.’ ‘Then trust mine,’ said Gandalf. ‘It quite made up. Go away leave behind. Stop possessing it. Give Frodo, I look him.’ Bilbo stood moment tense undecided. Presently sighed. ‘All right,’ said effort. ‘I will.’ Then shrugged shoulders, smiled rather ruefully. ‘After that’s party business about, really: give away lots birthday-presents, somehow make easier give away time. It hasn’t made easier end, would pity waste preparations. It would quite spoil joke.’ ‘Indeed would take away point I ever saw affair,’ said Gandalf. ‘Very well,’ said Bilbo, ‘it goes Frodo rest.’ He drew deep breath. ‘And I really must starting, somebody else catch me. I said good-bye, I couldn’t bear again.’ He picked bag moved door. ‘You still got ring pocket,’ said wizard. ‘Well, I have!’ cried Bilbo. ‘And documents too. You better take deliver me. That safest.’ ‘No, don’t give ring me,’ said Gandalf. ‘Put mantelpiece. It safe enough there, till Frodo comes. I shall wait him.’ Bilbo took envelope, set clock, hand jerked back, packet fell floor. Before could pick up, wizard stooped seized set place. A spasm anger passed swiftly hobbit’s face again. Suddenly gave way look relief laugh. ‘Well, that’s that,’ said. ‘Now I’m off!’ They went hall. Bilbo chose favourite stick stand; whistled. Three dwarves came different rooms busy. ‘Is everything ready?’ asked Bilbo. ‘Everything packed labelled?’ ‘Everything,’ answered. ‘Well, let’s start then!’ He stepped front-door. It fine night, black sky dotted stars. He looked up, sniffing air. ‘What fun! What fun again, Road dwarves! This I really longing for, years! Good-bye!’ said, looking old home bowing door. ‘Good-bye, Gandalf!’ ‘Good-bye, present, Bilbo. Take care yourself! You old enough, perhaps wise enough.’ ‘Take care! I don’t care. Don’t worry me! I happy I ever been, saying great deal. But time come. I swept feet last,’ added, low voice, himself, sang softly dark: The Road goes ever Down door began. Now far ahead Road gone, And I must follow, I can, Pursuing eager feet, Until joins larger way Where many paths errands meet. And whither then? I cannot say. He paused, silent moment. Then without another word turned away lights voices field tents, followed three companions went round garden, trotted long sloping path. He jumped low place hedge bottom, took meadows, passing night like rustle wind grass. Gandalf remained staring darkness. ‘Good-bye, dear Bilbo – next meeting!’ said softly went back indoors. Frodo came soon afterwards, found sitting dark, deep thought. ‘Has gone?’ asked. ‘Yes,’ answered Gandalf, ‘he gone last.’ ‘I wish – I mean, I hoped evening joke,’ said Frodo. ‘But I knew heart really meant go. He always used joke serious things. I wish I come back sooner, see off.’ ‘I think really preferred slipping quietly end,’ said Gandalf. ‘Don’t troubled. He’ll right – now. He left packet you. There is!’ Frodo took envelope mantelpiece, glanced it, open it. ‘You’ll find documents there, I think,’ said wizard. ‘You master Bag End now. And also, I fancy, you’ll find golden ring.’ ‘The ring!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘Has left that? I wonder why. Still, may useful.’ ‘It may, may not,’ said Gandalf. ‘I make use it, I you. But keep secret, keep safe! Now I going bed.’ * * * As master Bag End Frodo felt painful duty say good-bye guests. Rumours strange events spread field, Frodo would say doubt everything cleared morning. About midnight carriages came important folk. One one rolled away, filled full unsatisfied hobbits. Gardeners came arrangement, removed wheelbarrows inadvertently remained behind. Night slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later. Morning went on. People came began (by orders) clear away pavilions tables chairs, spoons knives bottles plates, lanterns, flowering shrubs boxes, crumbs cracker-paper, forgotten bags gloves handkerchiefs, uneaten food (a small item). Then number people came (without orders): Bagginses, Boffins, Bolgers, Tooks, guests lived staying near. By mid-day, even bestfed again, large crowd Bag End, uninvited unexpected. Frodo waiting step, smiling, looking rather tired worried. He welcomed callers, much say before. His reply inquiries simply this: ‘Mr. Bilbo Baggins gone away; far I know, good.’ Some visitors invited come inside, Bilbo left ‘messages’ them. Inside hall piled large assortment packages parcels small articles furniture. On every item label tied. There several labels sort: For ADELARD TOOK, VERY OWN, Bilbo; umbrella. Adelard carried many unlabelled ones. For DORA BAGGINS memory LONG correspondence, love Bilbo; large waste-paper basket. Dora Drogo’s sister eldest surviving female relative Bilbo Frodo; ninety-nine, written reams good advice half century. For MILO BURROWS, hoping useful, B.B.; gold pen ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters. For ANGELICA’S use, Uncle Bilbo; round convex mirror. She young Baggins, obviously considered face shapely. For collection HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, contributor; (empty) book-case. Hugo great borrower books, worse usual returning them. For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, PRESENT; case silver spoons. Bilbo believed acquired good many spoons, away former journey. Lobelia knew quite well. When arrived later day, took point once, also took spoons. This small selection assembled presents. Bilbo’s residence got rather cluttered things course long life. It tendency hobbit-holes get cluttered up: custom giving many birthday-presents largely responsible. Not, course, birthday-presents always new; one two old mathoms forgotten uses circulated around district; Bilbo usually given new presents, kept received. The old hole cleared little. Every one various parting gifts labels, written personally Bilbo, several point, joke. But, course, things given would wanted welcome. The poorer hobbits, especially Bagshot Row, well. Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks potatoes, new spade, woollen waistcoat, bottle ointment creaking joints. Old Rory Brandybuck, return much hospitality, got dozen bottles Old Winyards: strong red wine Southfarthing, quite mature, laid Bilbo’s father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, voted capital fellow first bottle. There plenty everything left Frodo. And, course, chief treasures, well books, pictures, enough furniture, left possession. There was, however, sign mention money jewellery: penny-piece glass bead given away. Frodo trying time afternoon. A false rumour whole household distributed free spread like wildfire; long place packed people business there, could kept out. Labels got torn mixed, quarrels broke out. Some people tried swaps deals hall; others tried make minor items addressed them, anything seemed unwanted unwatched. The road gate blocked barrows handcarts. In middle commotion Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo retired left friend Merry Brandybuck keep eye things. When Otho loudly demanded see Frodo, Merry bowed politely. ‘He indisposed,’ said. ‘He resting.’ ‘Hiding, mean,’ said Lobelia. ‘Anyway want see mean see him. Just go tell so!’ Merry left long hall, time discover parting gift spoons. It improve tempers. Eventually shown study. Frodo sitting table lot papers front him. He looked indisposed – see Sackville-Bagginses rate; stood up, fidgeting something pocket. But spoke quite politely. The Sackville-Bagginses rather offensive. They began offering bad bargain-prices (as friends) various valuable unlabelled things. When Frodo replied things specially directed Bilbo given away, said whole affair fishy. ‘Only one thing clear me,’ said Otho, ‘and exceedingly well it. I insist seeing will.’ Otho would Bilbo’s heir, adoption Frodo. He read carefully snorted. It was, unfortunately, clear correct (according legal customs hobbits, demand among things seven signatures witnesses red ink). ‘Foiled again!’ said wife. ‘And waiting sixty years. Spoons? Fiddlesticks!’ He snapped fingers Frodo’s nose stumped off. But Lobelia easily got rid of. A little later Frodo came study see things going on, found still place, investigating nooks corners, tapping floors. He escorted firmly premises, relieved several small (but rather valuable) articles somehow fallen inside umbrella. Her face looked throes thinking really crushing parting remark; found say, turning round step, was: ‘You’ll live regret it, young fellow! Why didn’t go too? You don’t belong here; you’re Baggins – – you’re Brandybuck!’ ‘Did hear that, Merry? That insult, like,’ said Frodo shut door her. ‘It compliment,’ said Merry Brandybuck, ‘and so, course, true.’ Then went round hole, evicted three young hobbits (two Boffins Bolger) knocking holes walls one cellars. Frodo also tussle young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot’s grandson), begun excavation larger pantry, thought echo. The legend Bilbo’s gold excited curiosity hope; legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, positively ill-gotten), is, everyone knows, anyone’s finding – unless search interrupted. When overcome Sancho pushed out, Frodo collapsed chair hall. ‘It’s time close shop, Merry,’ said. ‘Lock door, don’t open anyone today, even bring battering ram.’ Then went revive belated cup tea. He hardly sat down, came soft knock front-door. ‘Lobelia likely,’ thought. ‘She must thought something really nasty, come back say it. It wait.’ He went tea. The knock repeated, much louder, took notice. Suddenly wizard’s head appeared window. ‘If don’t let in, Frodo, I shall blow door right hole hill,’ said. ‘My dear Gandalf! Half minute!’ cried Frodo, running room door. ‘Come in! Come in! I thought Lobelia.’ ‘Then I forgive you. But I saw time ago, driving pony-trap towards Bywater face would curdled new milk.’ ‘She already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried Bilbo’s ring. I longed disappear.’ ‘Don’t that!’ said Gandalf, sitting down. ‘Do careful ring, Frodo! In fact, partly I come say last word.’ ‘Well, it?’ ‘What know already?’ ‘Only Bilbo told me. I heard story: found it, used it: journey, I mean.’ ‘Which story, I wonder,’ said Gandalf. ‘Oh, told dwarves put book,’ said Frodo. ‘He told true story soon I came live here. He said pestered till told you, I better know too. ‘‘No secrets us, Frodo,’’ said; ‘‘but go further. It’s mine anyway.’’’ ‘That’s interesting,’ said Gandalf. ‘Well, think all?’ ‘If mean, inventing ‘‘present’’, well, I thought true story much likely, I couldn’t see point altering all. It unlike Bilbo so, anyway; I thought rather odd.’ ‘So I. But odd things may happen people treasures – use them. Let warning careful it. It may powers making vanish wish to.’ ‘I don’t understand,’ said Frodo. ‘Neither I,’ answered wizard. ‘I merely begun wonder ring, especially since last night. No need worry. But take advice use seldom, all. At least I beg use way cause talk rouse suspicion. I say again: keep safe, keep secret!’ ‘You mysterious! What afraid of?’ ‘I certain, I say more. I may able tell something I come back. I going once: good-bye present.’ He got up. ‘At once!’ cried Frodo. ‘Why, I thought staying least week. I looking forward help.’ ‘I mean – I change mind. I may away good while; I’ll come see again, soon I can. Expect see me! I shall slip quietly. I shan’t often visiting Shire openly again. I find I become rather unpopular. They say I nuisance disturber peace. Some people actually accusing spiriting Bilbo away, worse. If want know, supposed plot get hold wealth.’ ‘Some people!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘You mean Otho Lobelia. How abominable! I would give Bag End everything else, I could get Bilbo back go tramping country him. I love Shire. But I begin wish, somehow, I gone too. I wonder I shall ever see again.’ ‘So I,’ said Gandalf. ‘And I wonder many things. Good-bye now! Take care yourself! Look me, especially unlikely times! Good-bye!’ Frodo saw door. He gave final wave hand, walked surprising pace; Frodo thought old wizard looked unusually bent, almost carrying great weight. The evening closing in, cloaked figure quickly vanished twilight. Frodo see long time. Chapter 2 THE SHADOW OF THE PAST The talk die nine even ninety-nine days. The second disappearance Mr. Bilbo Baggins discussed Hobbiton, indeed Shire, year day, remembered much longer that. It became fireside-story young hobbits; eventually Mad Baggins, used vanish bang flash reappear bags jewels gold, became favourite character legend lived long true events forgotten. But meantime, general opinion neighbourhood Bilbo, always rather cracked, last gone quite mad, run Blue. There undoubtedly fallen pool river come tragic, hardly untimely, end. The blame mostly laid Gandalf. ‘If dratted wizard leave young Frodo alone, perhaps he’ll settle grow hobbit-sense,’ said. And appearance wizard leave Frodo alone, settle down, growth hobbit-sense noticeable. Indeed, began carry Bilbo’s reputation oddity. He refused go mourning; next year gave party honour Bilbo’s hundred-and-twelfth birthday, called Hundredweight Feast. But short mark, twenty guests invited several meals snowed food rained drink, hobbits say. Some people rather shocked; Frodo kept custom giving Bilbo’s Birthday Party year year got used it. He said think Bilbo dead. When asked: ‘Where then?’ shrugged shoulders. He lived alone, Bilbo done; good many friends, especially among younger hobbits (mostly descendants Old Took) children fond Bilbo often Bag End. Folco Boffin Fredegar Bolger two these; closest friends Peregrin Took (usually called Pippin), Merry Brandybuck (his real name Meriadoc, seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping Shire them; often wandered himself, amazement sensible folk sometimes seen far home walking hills woods starlight. Merry Pippin suspected visited Elves times, Bilbo done. As time went on, people began notice Frodo also showed signs good ‘preservation’: outwardly retained appearance robust energetic hobbit tweens. ‘Some folk luck,’ said; Frodo approached usually sober age fifty began think queer. Frodohimself,afterthefirstshock,foundthatbeinghisown master Mr. Baggins Bag End rather pleasant. For years quite happy worry much future. But half unknown regret gone Bilbo steadily growing. He found wondering times, especially autumn, wild lands, strange visions mountains never seen came dreams. He began say himself: ‘Perhaps I shall cross River one day.’ To half mind always replied: ‘Not yet.’ So went on, forties running out, fiftieth birthday drawing near: fifty number felt somehow significant (or ominous); rate age adventure suddenly befallen Bilbo. Frodo began feel restless, old paths seemed well-trodden. He looked maps, wondered lay beyond edges: maps made Shire showed mostly white spaces beyond borders. He took wandering afield often himself; Merry friends watched anxiously. Often seen walking talking strange wayfarers began time appear Shire. There rumours strange things happening world outside; Gandalf time appeared sentanymessageforseveralyears,Frodogatheredallthenews could. Elves, seldom walked Shire, could seen passing westward woods evening, passing returning; leaving Middle-earth longer concerned troubles. There were, however, dwarves road unusual numbers. The ancient East–West Road ran Shire end Grey Havens, dwarves always used way mines Blue Mountains. They hobbits’ chief source news distant parts – wanted any: rule dwarves said little hobbits asked more. But Frodo often met strange dwarves far countries, seeking refuge West. They troubled, spoke whispers Enemy Land Mordor. That name hobbits knew legends dark past, like shadow background memories; ominous disquieting. It seemed evil power Mirkwood driven White Council reappear greater strength old strongholds Mordor. The Dark Tower rebuilt, said. From power spreading far wide, away far east south wars growing fear. Orcs multiplying mountains. Trolls abroad, longer dull-witted, cunning armed dreadful weapons. And murmured hints creatures terrible these, name. * * * Little this, course, reached ears ordinary hobbits. But even deafest stay-at-home began hear queer tales; whose business took borders saw strange things. The conversation The Green Dragon Bywater, one evening spring Frodo’s fiftieth year, showed even comfortable heart Shire rumours heard, though hobbits still laughed them. Sam Gamgee sitting one corner near fire, opposite Ted Sandyman, miller’s son; various rustic hobbits listening talk. ‘Queer things hear days, sure,’ said Sam. ‘Ah,’ said Ted, ‘you do, listen. But I hear firesidetales children’s stories home, I want to.’ ‘No doubt can,’ retorted Sam, ‘and I daresay there’s truth reckon. Who invented stories anyway? Take dragons now.’ ‘No thank ’ee,’ said Ted, ‘I won’t. I heard tell I youngster, there’s call believe now. There’s one Dragon Bywater, that’s Green,’ said, getting general laugh. ‘All right,’ said Sam, laughing rest. ‘But Tree-men, giants, might call them? They say one bigger tree seen away beyond North Moors long back.’ ‘Who’s they?’ ‘My cousin Hal one. He works Mr. Boffin Overhill goes Northfarthing hunting. He saw one.’ ‘Says did, perhaps. Your Hal’s always saying he’s seen things; maybe sees things ain’t there.’ ‘But one big elm tree, walking – walking seven yards stride, inch.’ ‘Then I bet wasn’t inch. What saw elm tree, like not.’ ‘But one walking, I tell you; ain’t elm tree North Moors.’ ‘Then Hal can’t seen one,’ said Ted. There laughing clapping: audience seemed think Ted scored point. ‘All same,’ said Sam, ‘you can’t deny others besides Halfast seen queer folk crossing Shire – crossing it, mind you: turned back borders. The Bounders never busy before. ‘And I’ve heard tell Elves moving west. They say going harbours, away beyond White Towers.’ Sam waved arm vaguely: neither knew far Sea, past old towers beyond western borders Shire. But old tradition away stood Grey Havens, times elven-ships set sail, never return. ‘They sailing, sailing, sailing Sea, going West leaving us,’ said Sam, half chanting words, shaking head sadly solemnly. But Ted laughed. ‘Well, isn’t anything new, believe old tales. And I don’t see matters you. Let sail! But I warrant haven’t seen it; anyone else Shire.’ ‘Well, I don’t know,’ said Sam thoughtfully. He believed seen Elf woods, still hoped see one day. Of legends heard early years fragments tales half-remembered stories Elves hobbits knew, always moved deeply. ‘There some, even parts, know Fair Folk get news them,’ said. ‘There’s Mr. Baggins now, I work for. He told sailingandheknowsabitaboutElves.AndoldMr.Bilboknew more: many’s talk I I little lad.’ ‘Oh, they’re cracked,’ said Ted. ‘Leastways old Bilbo cracked, Frodo’s cracking. If that’s get news from, you’ll never want moonshine. Well, friends, I’m home. Your good health!’ He drained mug went noisily. Sam sat silent said more. He good deal think about. For one thing, lot Bag End garden, would busy day tomorrow, weather cleared. The grass growing fast. But Sam mind gardening. After sighed, got went out. It early April sky clearing heavy rain. The sun down, cool pale evening quietly fading night. He walked home early stars Hobbiton Hill, whistling softly thoughtfully. It time Gandalf reappeared long absence. For three years Party away. Then paid Frodo brief visit, taking good look went again. During next year two turned fairly often, coming unexpectedly dusk, going without warning sunrise. He would discuss business journeys, seemed chiefly interested small news Frodo’s health doings. Then suddenly visits ceased. It nine years since Frodo seen heard him, begun think wizard would never return given interest hobbits. But evening, Sam walking home twilight fading, came familiar tap study window. Frodo welcomed old friend surprise great delight. They looked hard one another. ‘All well eh?’ said Gandalf. ‘You look ever, Frodo!’ ‘So you,’ Frodo replied; secretly thought Gandalf looked older careworn. He pressed news wide world, soon deep talk, stayed far night. Next morning late breakfast, wizard sitting Frodo open window study. A bright fire hearth, sun warm, wind South. Everything looked fresh, new green spring shimmering fields tips trees’ fingers. Gandalf thinking spring, nearly eighty years before, Bilbo run Bag End without handkerchief. His hair perhaps whiter then, beard eyebrows perhaps longer, face lined care wisdom; eyes bright ever, smoked blew smoke-rings vigour delight. He smoking silence, Frodo sitting still, deep thought. Even light morning felt dark shadow tidings Gandalf brought. At last broke silence. ‘Last night began tell strange things ring, Gandalf,’ said. ‘And stopped, said matters best left daylight. Don’t think better finish now? You say ring dangerous, far dangerous I guess. In way?’ ‘In many ways,’ answered wizard. ‘It far powerful I ever dared think first, powerful end would utterly overcome anyone mortal race possessed it. It would possess him. ‘In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings made, magic rings call them, were, course, various kinds: potent less. The lesser rings essays craft full-grown, Elven-smiths trifles – yet still mind dangerous mortals. But Great Rings, Rings Power, perilous. ‘A mortal, Frodo, keeps one Great Rings, die, grow obtain life, merely continues, last every minute weariness. And often uses Ring make invisible, fades: becomes end invisible permanently, walks twilight eye Dark Power rules Rings. Yes, sooner later – later, strong well-meaning begin with, neither strength good purpose last – sooner later Dark Power devour him.’ ‘How terrifying!’ said Frodo. There another long silence. The sound Sam Gamgee cutting lawn came garden. ‘How long known this?’ asked Frodo length. ‘And much Bilbo know?’ ‘Bilbo knew told you, I sure,’ said Gandalf. ‘He would certainly never passed anything thought would danger, even though I promised look you. He thought ring beautiful, useful need; anything wrong queer, himself. He said ‘‘growing mind’’, always worrying it; suspect ring blame. Though found thing needed looking after; seem always size weight; shrank expanded odd way, might suddenly slip finger tight.’ ‘Yes, warned last letter,’ said Frodo, ‘so I always kept chain.’ ‘Very wise,’ said Gandalf. ‘But long life, Bilbo never connected ring all. He took credit himself, proud it. Though getting restless uneasy. Thin stretched said. A sign ring getting control.’ ‘How long known this?’ asked Frodo again. ‘Known?’ said Gandalf. ‘I known much Wise know, Frodo. But mean ‘‘known ring’’, well, I still know, one might say. There last test make. But I longer doubt guess. ‘When I first begin guess?’ mused, searching back memory. ‘Let see – year White Council drove Dark Power Mirkwood, Battle Five Armies, Bilbo found ring. A shadow fell heart then, though I know yet I feared. I wondered often Gollum came Great Ring, plainly – least clear first. Then I heard Bilbo’s strange story ‘‘won’’ it, I could believe it. When I last got truth him, I saw trying put claim ring beyond doubt. Much like Gollum ‘‘birthdaypresent’’. The lies much alike comfort. Clearly ring unwholesome power set work keeper once. That first real warning I well. I told Bilbo often rings better left unused; resented it, soon got angry. There little else I could do. I could take without greater harm; I right anyway. I could watch wait. I might perhaps consulted Saruman White, something always held back.’ ‘Who he?’ asked Frodo. ‘I never heard before.’ ‘Maybe not,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Hobbits are, were, concern his. Yet great among Wise. He chief order head Council. His knowledge deep, pride grown it, takes ill meddling. The lore Elven-rings, great small, province. He long studied it, seeking lost secrets making; Rings debated Council, would reveal us ring-lore told fears. So doubt slept – uneasily. Still I watched I waited. ‘And seemed well Bilbo. And years passed. Yes, passed, seemed touch him. He showed signs age. The shadow fell again. But I said myself: ‘‘After comes long-lived family mother’s side. There time yet. Wait!’’ ‘And I waited. Until night left house. He said things filled fear words Saruman could allay. I knew last something dark deadly work. And I spent years since finding truth it.’ ‘There wasn’t permanent harm done, there?’ asked Frodo anxiously. ‘He would get right time, wouldn’t he? Be able rest peace, I mean?’ ‘He felt better once,’ said Gandalf. ‘But one Power world knows Rings effects; far I know Power world knows hobbits. Among Wise I one goes hobbit-lore: obscure branch knowledge, full surprises. Soft butter be, yet sometimes tough old tree-roots. I think likely would resist Rings far longer Wise would believe. I don’t think need worry Bilbo. ‘Of course, possessed ring many years, used it, might take long influence wear – safe see again, instance. Otherwise, might live years, quite happily: stop parted it. For gave end accord: important point. No, I troubled dear Bilbo more, let thing go. It I feel responsible. ‘Ever since Bilbo left I deeply concerned you, charming, absurd, helpless hobbits. It would grievous blow world, Dark Power overcame Shire; kind, jolly, stupid Bolgers, Hornblowers, Boffins, Bracegirdles, rest, mention ridiculous Bagginses, became enslaved.’ Frodo shuddered. ‘But be?’ asked. ‘And want slaves?’ ‘To tell truth,’ replied Gandalf, ‘I believe hitherto – hitherto, mark – entirely overlooked existence hobbits. You thankful. But safety passed. He need – many useful servants – won’t forget again. And hobbits miserable slaves would please far hobbits happy free. There thing malice revenge.’ ‘Revenge?’ said Frodo. ‘Revenge what? I still don’t understand Bilbo myself, ring.’ ‘It everything it,’ said Gandalf. ‘You know real peril yet; shall. I sure I last here; time come speak. Give ring moment.’ Frodo took breeches-pocket, clasped chain hung belt. He unfastened handed slowly wizard. It felt suddenly heavy, either Frodo way reluctant Gandalf touch it. Gandalf held up. It looked made pure solid gold. ‘Can see markings it?’ asked. ‘No,’ said Frodo. ‘There none. It quite plain, never shows scratch sign wear.’ ‘Well then, look!’ To Frodo’s astonishment distress wizard threw suddenly middle glowing corner fire. Frodo gave cry groped tongs; Gandalf held back. ‘Wait!’ said commanding voice, giving Frodo quick look bristling brows. No apparent change came ring. After Gandalf got up, closed shutters outside window, drew curtains. The room became dark silent, though clack Sam’s shears, nearer windows, could still heard faintly garden. For moment wizard stood looking fire; stooped removed ring hearth tongs, picked up. Frodo gasped. ‘It quite cool,’ said Gandalf. ‘Take it!’ Frodo received shrinking palm: seemed become thicker heavier ever. ‘Hold up!’ said Gandalf. ‘And look closely!’ As Frodo so, saw fine lines, finer finest pen-strokes, running along ring, outside inside: lines fire seemed form letters flowing script. They shone piercingly bright, yet remote, great depth. ‘I cannot read fiery letters,’ said Frodo quavering voice. ‘No,’ said Gandalf, ‘but I can. The letters Elvish, ancient mode, language Mordor, I utter here. But Common Tongue said, close enough: One Ring rule all, One Ring find them, One Ring bring darkness bind them. It two lines verse long known Elven-lore: Three Rings Elven-kings sky, Seven Dwarf-lords halls stone, Nine Mortal Men doomed die, One Dark Lord dark throne In Land Mordor Shadows lie. One Ring rule all, One Ring find them, One Ring bring darkness bind In Land Mordor Shadows lie.’ He paused, said slowly deep voice: ‘This Master-ring, One Ring rule all. This One Ring lost many ages ago, great weakening power. He greatly desires – must get it.’ Frodo sat silent motionless. Fear seemed stretch vast hand, like dark cloud rising East looming engulf him. ‘This ring!’ stammered. ‘How, earth come me?’ ‘Ah!’ said Gandalf. ‘That long story. The beginnings lie back Black Years, lore-masters remember. If I tell tale, still sitting Spring passed Winter. ‘But last night I told Sauron Great, Dark Lord. The rumours heard true: indeed arisen left hold Mirkwood returned ancient fastness Dark Tower Mordor. That name even hobbits heard of, like shadow borders old stories. Always defeat respite, Shadow takes another shape grows again.’ ‘I wish need happened time,’ said Frodo. ‘So I,’ said Gandalf, ‘and live see times. But decide. All decide time given us. And already, Frodo, time beginning look black. The Enemy fast becoming strong. His plans far ripe, I think, ripening. We shall hard put it. We hard put it, even dreadful chance. ‘The Enemy still lacks one thing give strength knowledge beat resistance, break last defences, cover lands second darkness. He lacks One Ring. ‘The Three, fairest all, Elf-lords hid him, hand never touched sullied them. Seven Dwarf-kings possessed, three recovered, others dragons consumed. Nine gave Mortal Men, proud great, ensnared them. Long ago fell dominion One, became Ringwraiths, shadows great Shadow, terrible servants. Long ago. It many year since Nine walked abroad. Yet knows? As Shadow grows more, may walk again. But come! We speak things even morning Shire. ‘So now: Nine gathered himself; Seven also, else destroyed. The Three hidden still. But longer troubles him. He needs One; made Ring himself, his, let great part former power pass it, could rule others. If recovers it, command again, wherever be, even Three, wrought laid bare, stronger ever. ‘And dreadful chance, Frodo. He believed One perished; Elves destroyed it, done. But knows perished, found. So seeking it, seeking it, thought bent it. It great hope great fear.’ ‘Why, wasn’t destroyed?’ cried Frodo. ‘And Enemy ever come lose it, strong, precious him?’ He clutched Ring hand, saw already dark fingers stretching seize it. ‘It taken him,’ said Gandalf. ‘The strength Elves resist greater long ago; Men estranged them. The Men Westernesse came aid. That chapter ancient history might good recall; sorrow too, gathering dark, great valour, great deeds wholly vain. One day, perhaps, I tell tale, shall hear told full one knows best. ‘But moment, since need know thing came you, tale enough, I say. It Gil-galad, Elven-king Elendil Westernesse overthrew Sauron, though perished deed; Isildur Elendil’s son cut Ring Sauron’s hand took own. Then Sauron vanquished spirit fled hidden long years, shadow took shape Mirkwood. ‘But Ring lost. It fell Great River, Anduin, vanished. For Isildur marching north along east banks River, near Gladden Fields waylaid Orcs Mountains, almost folk slain. He leaped waters, Ring slipped finger swam, Orcs saw killed arrows.’ Gandalf paused. ‘And dark pools amid Gladden Fields,’ said, ‘the Ring passed knowledge legend; even much history known few, Council Wise could discover more. But last I carry story, I think. ‘Long after, still long ago, lived banks Great River edge Wilderland clever-handed quiet-footed little people. I guess hobbitkind; akin fathers fathers Stoors, loved River, often swam it, made little boats reeds. There among family high repute, large wealthier most, ruled grandmother folk, stern wise old lore, had. The inquisitive curious-minded family called Sme´agol. He interested roots beginnings; dived deep pools; burrowed trees growing plants; tunnelled green mounds; ceased look hill-tops, leaves trees, flowers opening air: head eyes downward. ‘He friend called De´agol, similar sort, sharpereyed quick strong. On time took boat went Gladden Fields, great beds iris flowering reeds. There Sme´agol got went nosing banks De´agol sat boat fished. Suddenly great fish took hook, knew was, dragged water, bottom. Then let go line, thought saw something shining river-bed; holding breath grabbed it. ‘Then came spluttering, weeds hair handful mud; swam bank. And behold! washed mud away, hand lay beautiful golden ring; shone glittered sun, heart glad. But Sme´agol watching behind tree, De´agol gloated ring, Sme´agol came softly behind. ‘‘‘Give us that, De´agol, love,’’ said Sme´agol, friend’s shoulder. ‘‘‘Why?’’ said De´agol. ‘‘‘Because it’s birthday, love, I wants it,’’ said Sme´agol. ‘‘‘I don’t care,’’ said De´agol. ‘‘I given present already, I could afford. I found this, I’m going keep it.’’ ‘‘‘Oh, indeed, love,’’ said Sme´agol; caught De´agol throat strangled him, gold looked bright beautiful. Then put ring finger. ‘No one ever found become De´agol; murdered far home, body cunningly hidden. But Sme´agol returned alone; found none family could see him, wearing ring. He pleased discovery concealed it; used find secrets, put knowledge crooked malicious uses. He became sharp-eyed keen-eared hurtful. The ring given power according stature. It wondered became unpopular shunned (when visible) relations. They kicked him, bit feet. He took thieving, going muttering himself, gurgling throat. So called Gollum, cursed him, told go far away; grandmother, desiring peace, expelled family turned hole. ‘He wandered loneliness, weeping little hardness world, journeyed River, till came stream flowed mountains, went way. He caught fish deep pools invisible fingers ate raw. One day hot, bending pool, felt burning back head, dazzling light water pained wet eyes. He wondered it, almost forgotten Sun. Then last time looked shook fist her. ‘But lowered eyes, saw far ahead tops Misty Mountains, stream came. And thought suddenly: ‘‘It would cool shady mountains. The Sun could watch there. The roots mountains must roots indeed; must great secrets buried discovered since beginning.’’ ‘So journeyed night highlands, found little cave dark stream ran; wormed way like maggot heart hills, vanished knowledge. The Ring went shadows him, even maker, power begun grow again, could learn nothing it.’ ‘Gollum!’ cried Frodo. ‘Gollum? Do mean Gollum-creature Bilbo met? How loathsome!’ ‘I think sad story,’ said wizard, ‘and might happened others, even hobbits I known.’ ‘I can’t believe Gollum connected hobbits, however distantly,’ said Frodo heat. ‘What abominable notion!’ ‘It true same,’ replied Gandalf. ‘About origins, rate, I know hobbits themselves. And even Bilbo’s story suggests kinship. There great deal background minds memories similar. They understood one another remarkably well, much better hobbit would understand, say, Dwarf, Orc, even Elf. Think riddles knew, one thing.’ ‘Yes,’ said Frodo. ‘Though folks besides hobbits ask riddles, much sort. And hobbits don’t cheat. Gollum meant cheat time. He trying put poor Bilbo guard. And I daresay amused wickedness start game might end providing easy victim, lost would hurt him.’ ‘Only true, I fear,’ said Gandalf. ‘But something else it, I think, don’t see yet. Even Gollum wholly ruined. He proved tougher even one Wise would guessed – hobbit might. There little corner mind still own, light came it, chink dark: light past. It actually pleasant, I think, hear kindly voice again, bringing memories wind, trees, sun grass, forgotten things. ‘But that, course, would make evil part angrier end – unless could conquered. Unless could cured.’ Gandalf sighed. ‘Alas! little hope him. Yet hope. No, though possessed Ring long, almost far back remember. For long since worn much: black darkness seldom needed. Certainly never ‘‘faded’’. He thin tough still. But thing eating mind, course, torment become almost unbearable. ‘All ‘‘great secrets’’ mountains turned empty night: nothing find out, nothing worth doing, nasty furtive eating resentful remembering. He altogether wretched. He hated dark, hated light more: hated everything, Ring all.’ ‘What mean?’ said Frodo. ‘Surely Ring Precious thing cared for? But hated it, didn’t get rid it, go away leave it?’ ‘You ought begin understand, Frodo, heard,’ said Gandalf. ‘He hated loved it, hated loved himself. He could get rid it. He left matter. ‘A Ring Power looks itself, Frodo. It may slip treacherously, keeper never abandons it. At plays idea handing someone else’s care – early stage, first begins grip. But far I know Bilbo alone history ever gone beyond playing, really done it. He needed help, too. And even would never forsaken it, cast aside. It Gollum, Frodo, Ring decided things. The Ring left him.’ ‘What, time meet Bilbo?’ said Frodo. ‘Wouldn’t Orc suited better?’ ‘It laughing matter,’ said Gandalf. ‘Not you. It strangest event whole history Ring far: Bilbo’s arrival time, putting hand it, blindly, dark. ‘There one power work, Frodo. The Ring trying get back master. It slipped Isildur’s hand betrayed him; chance came caught poor De´agol, murdered; Gollum, devoured him. It could make use him: small mean; long stayed would never leave deep pool again. So now, master awake sending dark thought Mirkwood, abandoned Gollum. Only picked unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo Shire! ‘Behind something else work, beyond design Ring-maker. I put plainer saying Bilbo meant find Ring, maker. In case also meant it. And may encouraging thought.’ ‘It not,’ said Frodo. ‘Though I sure I understand you. But learned Ring, Gollum? Do really know all, guessing still?’ Gandalf looked Frodo, eyes glinted. ‘I knew much I learned much,’ answered. ‘But I going give account doings you. The history Elendil Isildur One Ring known Wise. Your ring shown One Ring firewriting alone, apart evidence.’ ‘And discover that?’ asked Frodo, interrupting. ‘Just room, course,’ answered wizard sharply. ‘But I expected find it. I come back dark journeys long search make final test. It last proof, clear. Making Gollum’s part, fitting gap history, required thought. I may started guesses Gollum, I guessing now. I know. I seen him.’ ‘You seen Gollum?’ exclaimed Frodo amazement. ‘Yes. The obvious thing do, course, one could. I tried long ago; I managed last.’ ‘Then happened Bilbo escaped him? Do know that?’ ‘Not clearly. What I told Gollum willing tell – though not, course, way I reported it. Gollum liar, sift words. For instance, called Ring ‘‘birthday-present’’, stuck that. He said came grandmother, lots beautiful things kind. A ridiculous story. I doubt Sme´agol’s grandmother matriarch, great person way, talk possessing many Elven-rings absurd, giving away, lie. But lie grain truth. ‘The murder De´agol haunted Gollum, made defence, repeating ‘‘Precious’’ again, gnawed bones dark, almost believed it. It birthday. De´agol ought given ring him. It obviously turned present. It birthday-present, on, on. ‘I endured long I could, truth desperately important, end I harsh. I put fear fire him, wrung true story him, bit bit, together much snivelling snarling. He thought misunderstood ill-used. But last told history, far end Riddle-game Bilbo’s escape, would say more, except dark hints. Some fear greater mine. He muttered going get back. People would see would stand kicked, driven hole robbed. Gollum good friends now, good friends strong. They would help him. Baggins would pay it. That chief thought. He hated Bilbo cursed name. What more, knew came from.’ ‘But find out?’ asked Frodo. ‘Well, name, Bilbo foolishly told Gollum himself; would difficult discover country, Gollum came out. Oh yes, came out. His longing Ring proved stronger fear Orcs, even light. After year two left mountains. You see, though still bound desire it, Ring longer devouring him; began revive little. He felt old, terribly old, yet less timid, mortally hungry. ‘Light, light Sun Moon, still feared hated, always will, I think; cunning. He found could hide daylight moonshine, make way swiftly softly dead night pale cold eyes, catch small frightened unwary things. He grew stronger bolder new food new air. He found way Mirkwood, one would expect.’ ‘Is found him?’ asked Frodo. ‘I saw there,’ answered Gandalf, ‘but wandered far, following Bilbo’s trail. It difficult learn anything certain, talk constantly interrupted curses threats. ‘‘What got pocketses?’’ said. ‘‘It wouldn’t say, precious. Little cheat. Not fair question. It cheated first, did. It broke rules. We ought squeezed it, yes precious. And will, precious!’’ ‘That sample talk. I don’t suppose want more. I weary days it. But hints dropped among snarls I gathered padding feet taken last Esgaroth, even streets Dale, listening secretly peering. Well, news great events went far wide Wilderland, many heard Bilbo’s name knew came from. We made secret return journey home West. Gollum’s sharp ears would soon learn wanted.’ ‘Then didn’t track Bilbo further?’ asked Frodo. ‘Why didn’t come Shire?’ ‘Ah,’ said Gandalf, ‘now come it. I think Gollum tried to. He set came back westward, far Great River. But turned aside. He daunted distance, I sure. No, something else drew away. So friends think, hunted me. ‘The Wood-elves tracked first, easy task them, trail still fresh then. Through Mirkwood back led them, though never caught him. The wood full rumour him, dreadful tales even among beasts birds. The Woodmen said new terror abroad, ghost drank blood. It climbed trees find nests; crept holes find young; slipped windows find cradles. ‘But western edge Mirkwood trail turned away. It wandered southwards passed Wood-elves’ ken, lost. And I made great mistake. Yes, Frodo, first; though I fear may prove worst. I let matter be. I let go; I much else think time, I still trusted lore Saruman. ‘Well, years ago. I paid since many dark dangerous days. The trail long cold I took again, Bilbo left here. And search would vain, help I friend: Aragorn, greatest traveller huntsman age world. Together sought Gollum whole length Wilderland, without hope, without success. But last, I given chase turned paths, Gollum found. My friend returned great perils bringing miserable creature him. ‘What would say. He wept called us cruel, many gollum throat; pressed whined cringed, rubbed long hands, licking fingers pained him, remembered old torture. But I afraid possible doubt: made slow, sneaking way, step step, mile mile, south, last Land Mordor.’ A heavy silence fell room. Frodo could hear heart beating. Even outside everything seemed still. No sound Sam’s shears could heard. ‘Yes, Mordor,’ said Gandalf. ‘Alas! Mordor draws wicked things, Dark Power bending gather there. The Ring Enemy would leave mark, too, leave open summons. And folk whispering new Shadow South, hatred West. There fine new friends, would help revenge! ‘Wretched fool! In land would learn much, much comfort. And sooner later lurked pried borders would caught, taken – examination. That way it, I fear. When found already long, way back. On errand mischief. But matter much now. His worst mischief done. ‘Yes, alas! Enemy learned One found again. He knows Isildur fell. He knows Gollum found ring. He knows Great Ring, gave long life. He knows one Three, never lost, endure evil. He knows one Seven, Nine, accounted for. He knows One. And last heard, I think, hobbits Shire. ‘The Shire – may seeking now, already found lies. Indeed, Frodo, I fear may even think long-unnoticed name Baggins become important.’ ‘But terrible!’ cried Frodo. ‘Far worse worst I imagined hints warnings. O Gandalf, best friends, I do? For I really afraid. What I do? What pity Bilbo stab vile creature, chance!’ ‘Pity? It Pity stayed hand. Pity, Mercy: strike without need. And well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure took little hurt evil, escaped end, began ownership Ring so. With Pity.’ ‘I sorry,’ said Frodo. ‘But I frightened; I feel pity Gollum.’ ‘You seen him,’ Gandalf broke in. ‘No, I don’t want to,’ said Frodo. ‘I can’t understand you. Do mean say you, Elves, let live horrible deeds? Now rate bad Orc, enemy. He deserves death.’ ‘Deserves it! I daresay does. Many live deserve death. And die deserve life. Can give them? Then eager deal death judgement. For even wise cannot see ends. I much hope Gollum cured dies, chance it. And bound fate Ring. My heart tells part play yet, good ill, end; comes, pity Bilbo may rule fate many – least. In case kill him: old wretched. The Wood-elves prison, treat kindness find wise hearts.’ ‘All same,’ said Frodo, ‘even Bilbo could kill Gollum, I wish kept Ring. I wish never found it, I got it! Why let keep it? Why didn’t make throw away, or, destroy it?’ ‘Let you? Make you?’ said wizard. ‘Haven’t listening I said? You thinking saying. But throwing away, obviously wrong. These Rings way found. In evil hands might done great evil. Worst all, might fallen hands Enemy. Indeed certainly would; One, exerting power find draw himself. ‘Of course, dear Frodo, dangerous you; troubled deeply. But much stake I take risk – though even I far away never day Shire guarded watchful eyes. As long never used it, I think Ring would lasting effect you, evil, rate long time. And must remember nine years ago, I last saw you, I still knew little certain.’ ‘But destroy it, say done long ago?’ cried Frodo again. ‘If warned me, even sent message, I would done away it.’ ‘Would you? How would that? Have ever tried?’ ‘No. But I suppose one could hammer melt it.’ ‘Try!’ said Gandalf. ‘Try now!’ Frodo drew Ring pocket looked it. It appeared plain smooth, without mark device could see. The gold looked fair pure, Frodo thought rich beautiful colour, perfect roundness. It admirable thing altogether precious. When took intended fling hottest part fire. But found could so, without great struggle. He weighed Ring hand, hesitating, forcing remember Gandalf told him; effort made movement, cast away – found put back pocket. Gandalf laughed grimly. ‘You see? Already too, Frodo, cannot easily let go, damage it. And I could ‘‘make’’ – except force, would break mind. But breaking Ring, force useless. Even took struck heavy sledge-hammer, would make dint it. It cannot unmade hands, mine. ‘Your small fire, course, would melt even ordinary gold. This Ring already passed unscathed, even unheated. But smith’s forge Shire could change all. Not even anvils furnaces Dwarves could that. It said dragon-fire could melt consume Rings Power, dragon left earth old fire hot enough; ever dragon, even Ancalagon Black, could harmed One Ring, Ruling Ring, made Sauron himself. ‘There one way: find Cracks Doom depths Orodruin, Fire-mountain, cast Ring there, really wish destroy it, put beyond grasp Enemy ever.’ ‘I really wish destroy it!’ cried Frodo. ‘Or, well, destroyed. I made perilous quests. I wish I never seen Ring! Why come me? Why I chosen?’ ‘Such questions cannot answered,’ said Gandalf. ‘You may sure merit others possess: power wisdom, rate. But chosen, must therefore use strength heart wits have.’ ‘But I little things! You wise powerful. Will take Ring?’ ‘No!’ cried Gandalf, springing feet. ‘With power I power great terrible. And Ring would gain power still greater deadly.’ His eyes flashed face lit fire within. ‘Do tempt me! For I wish become like Dark Lord himself. Yet way Ring heart pity, pity weakness desire strength good. Do tempt me! I dare take it, even keep safe, unused. The wish wield would great strength. I shall need it. Great perils lie me.’ He went window drew aside curtains shutters. Sunlight streamed back room. Sam passed along path outside whistling. ‘And now,’ said wizard, turning back Frodo, ‘the decision lies you. But I always help you.’ He laid hand Frodo’s shoulder. ‘I help bear burden, long bear. But must something, soon. The Enemy moving.’ There long silence. Gandalf sat puffed pipe, lost thought. His eyes seemed closed, lids watching Frodo intently. Frodo gazed fixedly red embers hearth, filled vision, seemed looking profound wells fire. He thinking fabled Cracks Doom terror Fiery Mountain. ‘Well!’ said Gandalf last. ‘What thinking about? Have decided do?’ ‘No!’ answered Frodo, coming back darkness, finding surprise dark, window could see sunlit garden. ‘Or perhaps, yes. As far I understand said, I suppose I must keep Ring guard it, least present, whatever may me.’ ‘Whatever may do, slow, slow evil, keep purpose,’ said Gandalf. ‘I hope so,’ said Frodo. ‘But I hope may find better keeper soon. But meanwhile seems I danger, danger live near me. I cannot keep Ring stay here. I ought leave Bag End, leave Shire, leave everything go away.’ He sighed. ‘I like save Shire, I could – though times I thought inhabitants stupid dull words, felt earthquake invasion dragons might good them. But I don’t feel like now. I feel long Shire lies behind, safe comfortable, I shall find wandering bearable: I shall know somewhere firm foothold, even feet cannot stand again. ‘Of course, I sometimes thought going away, I imagined kind holiday, series adventures like Bilbo’s better, ending peace. But would mean exile, flight danger danger, drawing me. And I suppose I must go alone, I save Shire. But I feel small, uprooted, well – desperate. The Enemy strong terrible.’ He tell Gandalf, speaking great desire follow Bilbo flamed heart – follow Bilbo, even perhaps find again. It strong overcame fear: could almost run road without hat, Bilbo done similar morning long ago. ‘My dear Frodo!’ exclaimed Gandalf. ‘Hobbits really amazing creatures, I said before. You learn know ways month, yet hundred years still surprise pinch. I hardly expected get answer, even you. But Bilbo made mistake choosing heir, though little thought important would prove. I afraid right. The Ring able stay hidden Shire much longer; sake, well others, go, leave name Baggins behind you. That name safe have, outside Shire Wild. I give travelling name now. When go, go Mr. Underhill. ‘But I don’t think need go alone. Not know anyone trust, would willing go side – would willing take unknown perils. But look companion, careful choosing! And careful say, even closest friends! The enemy many spies many ways hearing.’ Suddenly stopped listening. Frodo became aware quiet, inside outside. Gandalf crept one side window. Then dart sprang sill, thrust long arm downwards. There squawk, came Sam Gamgee’s curly head hauled one ear. ‘Well, well, bless beard!’ said Gandalf. ‘Sam Gamgee it? Now may doing?’ ‘Lor bless you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!’ said Sam. ‘Nothing! Leastways I trimming grass-border window, follow me.’ He picked shears exhibited evidence. ‘I don’t,’ said Gandalf grimly. ‘It time since I last heard sound shears. How long eavesdropping?’ ‘Eavesdropping, sir? I don’t follow you, begging pardon. There ain’t eaves Bag End, that’s fact.’ ‘Don’t fool! What heard, listen?’ Gandalf’s eyes flashed brows stuck like bristles. ‘Mr. Frodo, sir!’ cried Sam quaking. ‘Don’t let hurt me, sir! Don’t let turn anything unnatural! My old dad would take so. I meant harm, honour, sir!’ ‘He won’t hurt you,’ said Frodo, hardly able keep laughing, although startled rather puzzled. ‘He knows, well I do, mean harm. But answer questions straight away!’ ‘Well, sir,’ said Sam dithering little. ‘I heard deal I didn’t rightly understand, enemy, rings, Mr. Bilbo, sir, dragons, fiery mountain, – Elves, sir. I listened I couldn’t help myself, know I mean. Lor bless me, sir, I love tales sort. And I believe too, whatever Ted may say. Elves, sir! I would dearly love see them. Couldn’t take see Elves, sir, go?’ Suddenly Gandalf laughed. ‘Come inside!’ shouted, putting arms lifted astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippings all, right window stood floor. ‘Take see Elves, eh?’ said, eyeing Sam closely, smile flickering face. ‘So heard Mr. Frodo going away?’ ‘I did, sir. And that’s I choked: heard seemingly. I tried to, sir, burst me: I upset.’ ‘It can’t helped, Sam,’ said Frodo sadly. He suddenly realized flying Shire would mean painful partings merely saying farewell familiar comforts Bag End. ‘I shall go. But’ – looked hard Sam – ‘if really care me, keep dead secret. See? If don’t, even breathe word you’ve heard here, I hope Gandalf turn spotted toad fill garden full grasssnakes.’ Sam fell knees, trembling. ‘Get up, Sam!’ said Gandalf. ‘I thought something better that. Something shut mouth, punish properly listening. You shall go away Mr. Frodo!’ ‘Me, sir!’ cried Sam, springing like dog invited walk. ‘Me go see Elves all! Hooray!’ shouted, burst tears. Chapter 3 THREE IS COMPANY ‘You ought go quietly, ought go soon,’ said Gandalf. Two three weeks passed, still Frodo made sign getting ready go. ‘I know. But difficult both,’ objected. ‘If I vanish like Bilbo, tale Shire time.’ ‘Of course mustn’t vanish!’ said Gandalf. ‘That wouldn’t all! I said soon, instantly. If think way slipping Shire without generally known, worth little delay. But must delay long.’ ‘What autumn, Our Birthday?’ asked Frodo. ‘I think I could probably make arrangements then.’ To tell truth, reluctant start, come point: Bag End seemed desirable residence years, wanted savour much could last summer Shire. When autumn came, knew part least heart would think kindly journeying, always season. He indeed privately made mind leave fiftieth birthday: Bilbo’s one hundred twentyeighth. It seemed somehow proper day set follow him. Following Bilbo uppermost mind, one thing made thought leaving bearable. He thought little possible Ring, might lead end. But tell thoughts Gandalf. What wizard guessed always difficult tell. He looked Frodo smiled. ‘Very well,’ said. ‘I think – must later. I getting anxious. In meanwhile, take care, don’t let hint going! And see Sam Gamgee talk. If does, I really shall turn toad.’ ‘As I going,’ said Frodo, ‘it would difficult give away, I clear idea myself, yet.’ ‘Don’t absurd!’ said Gandalf. ‘I warning leaving address post-office! But leaving Shire – known, far away. And must go, least set out, either North, South, West East – direction certainly known.’ ‘I taken thoughts leaving Bag End, saying farewell, I never even considered direction,’ said Frodo. ‘For I go? And shall I steer? What quest? Bilbo went find treasure, back again; I go lose one, return, far I see.’ ‘But cannot see far,’ said Gandalf. ‘Neither I. It may task find Cracks Doom; quest may others: I know. At rate ready long road yet.’ ‘No indeed!’ said Frodo. ‘But meantime course I take?’ ‘Towards danger; rashly, straight,’ answered wizard. ‘If want advice, make Rivendell. That journey prove perilous, though Road less easy was, grow worse year fails.’ ‘Rivendell!’ said Frodo. ‘Very good: I go east, I make Rivendell. I take Sam visit Elves; delighted.’ He spoke lightly; heart moved suddenly desire see house Elrond Halfelven, breathe air deep valley many Fair Folk still dwelt peace. One summer’s evening astonishing piece news reached Ivy Bush Green Dragon. Giants portents borders Shire forgotten important matters: Mr. Frodo selling Bag End, indeed already sold – Sackville-Bagginses! ‘For nice bit, too,’ said some. ‘At bargain price,’ said others, ‘and that’s likely Mistress Lobelia’s buyer.’ (Otho died years before, ripe disappointed age 102.) Just Mr. Frodo selling beautiful hole even debatable price. A held theory – supported nods hints Mr. Baggins – Frodo’s money running out: going leave Hobbiton live quiet way proceeds sale Buckland among Brandybuck relations. ‘As far Sackville-Bagginses may be,’ added. But firmly fixed notion immeasurable wealth Bagginses Bag End become found hard believe, harder reason unreason fancy could suggest: suggested dark yet unrevealed plot Gandalf. Though kept quiet go day, well known ‘hiding Bag End’. But however removal might fit designs wizardry, doubt fact: Frodo Baggins going back Buckland. ‘Yes, I shall moving autumn,’ said. ‘Merry Brandybuck looking nice little hole me, perhaps small house.’ As matter fact Merry’s help already chosen bought little house Crickhollow country beyond Bucklebury. To Sam pretended going settle permanently. The decision set eastwards suggested idea him; Buckland eastern borders Shire, lived childhood going back would least seem credible. Gandalf stayed Shire two months. Then one evening, end June, soon Frodo’s plan finally arranged, suddenly announced going next morning. ‘Only short while, I hope,’ said. ‘But I going beyond southern borders get news, I can. I idle longer I should.’ He spoke lightly, seemed Frodo looked rather worried. ‘Has anything happened?’ asked. ‘Well no; I heard something made anxious needs looking into. If I think necessary get once, I shall come back immediately, least send word. In meanwhile stick plan; careful ever, especially Ring. Let impress more: don’t use it!’ He went dawn. ‘I may back day,’ said. ‘At latest I shall come back farewell party. I think may need company Road.’ At first Frodo good deal disturbed, wondered often Gandalf could heard; uneasiness wore off, fine weather forgot troubles while. The Shire seldom seen fair summer, rich autumn: trees laden apples, honey dripping combs, corn tall full. Autumn well way Frodo began worry Gandalf again. September passing still news him. The Birthday, removal, drew nearer, still come, send word. Bag End began busy. Some Frodo’s friends came stay help packing: Fredegar Bolger Folco Boffin, course special friends Pippin Took Merry Brandybuck. Between turned whole place upside-down. On September 20th two covered carts went laden Buckland, conveying furniture goods Frodo sold new home, way Brandywine Bridge.The next day Frodo became really anxious, kept constant look-out Gandalf. Thursday, birthday morning, dawned fair clear long ago Bilbo’s great party. Still Gandalf appear. In evening Frodo gave farewell feast: quite small, dinner four helpers; troubled felt mood it. The thought would soon part young friends weighed heart. He wondered would break them. The four younger hobbits were, however, high spirits, party soon became cheerful spite Gandalf’s absence. The dining-room bare except table chairs, food good, good wine: Frodo’s wine included sale Sackville-Bagginses. ‘Whatever happens rest stuff, S.-B.s get claws it, rate I found good home this!’ said Frodo, drained glass. It last drop Old Winyards. When sung many songs, talked many things done together, toasted Bilbo’s birthday, drank health Frodo’s together according Frodo’s custom. Then went sniff air, glimpse stars, went bed. Frodo’s party over, Gandalf come. The next morning busy packing another cart remainder luggage. Merry took charge this, drove Fatty (that Fredegar Bolger). ‘Someone must get warm house arrive,’ said Merry. ‘Well, see later – day tomorrow, don’t go sleep way!’ Folco went home lunch, Pippin remained behind. Frodo restless anxious, listening vain sound Gandalf. He decided wait nightfall. After that, Gandalf wanted urgently, would go Crickhollow, might even get first. For Frodo going foot. His plan – pleasure last look Shire much reason – walk Hobbiton Bucklebury Ferry, taking fairly easy. ‘I shall get bit training, too,’ said, looking dusty mirror half-empty hall. He done strenuous walking long time, reflection looked rather flabby, thought. After lunch, Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia sandy-haired son, Lotho, turned up, much Frodo’s annoyance. ‘Ours last!’ said Lobelia, stepped inside. It polite; strictly true, sale Bag End take effect midnight. But Lobelia perhaps forgiven: obliged wait seventy-seven years longer Bag End hoped, hundred years old. Anyway, come see nothing paid carried off; wanted keys. It took long satisfy her, brought complete inventory went right it. In end departed Lotho spare key promise key would left Gamgees’ Bagshot Row. She snorted, showed plainly thought Gamgees capable plundering hole night. Frodo offer tea. He took tea Pippin Sam Gamgee kitchen. It officially announced Sam coming Buckland ‘to Mr. Frodo look bit garden’; arrangement approved Gaffer, though console prospect Lobelia neighbour. ‘Our last meal Bag End!’ said Frodo, pushing back chair. They left washing Lobelia. Pippin Sam strapped three packs piled porch. Pippin went last stroll garden. Sam disappeared. The sun went down. Bag End seemed sad gloomy dishevelled. Frodo wandered round familiar rooms, saw light sunset fade walls, shadows creep corners. It grew slowly dark indoors. He went walked gate bottom path, short way Hill Road. He half expected see Gandalf come striding dusk. The sky clear stars growing bright. ‘It’s going fine night,’ said aloud. ‘That’s good beginning. I feel like walking. I can’t bear hanging about. I going start, Gandalf must follow me.’ He turned go back, stopped, heard voices, round corner end Bagshot Row. One voice certainly old Gaffer’s; strange, somehow unpleasant. He could make said, heard Gaffer’s answers, rather shrill. The old man seemed put out. ‘No, Mr. Baggins gone away. Went morning, Sam went him: anyway stuff went. Yes, sold gone, I tell’ee. Why? Why’s none business, yours. Where to? That ain’t secret. He’s moved Bucklebury place, away yonder. Yes – tidy way. I’ve never far myself; they’re queer folks Buckland. No, I can’t give message. Good night you!’ Footsteps went away Hill. Frodo wondered vaguely fact come Hill seemed great relief. ‘I sick questions curiosity doings, I suppose,’ thought. ‘What inquisitive lot are!’ He half mind go ask Gaffer inquirer was; thought better (or worse) it, turned walked quickly back Bag End. Pippin sitting pack porch. Sam there. Frodo stepped inside dark door. ‘Sam!’ called. ‘Sam! Time!’ ‘Coming, sir!’ came answer far within, followed soon Sam himself, wiping mouth. He saying farewell beer-barrel cellar. ‘All aboard, Sam?’ said Frodo. ‘Yes, sir. I’ll last bit now, sir.’ Frodo shut locked round door, gave key Sam. ‘Run home, Sam!’ said. ‘Then cut along Row meet us quick gate lane beyond meadows. We going village tonight. Too many ears pricking eyes prying.’ Sam ran full speed. ‘Well, we’re last!’ said Frodo. They shouldered packs took sticks, walked round corner west side Bag End. ‘Good-bye!’ said Frodo, looking dark blank windows. He waved hand, turned (following Bilbo, known it) hurried Peregrin garden-path. They jumped low place hedge bottom took fields, passing darkness like rustle grasses. At bottom Hill western side came gate opening narrow lane. There halted adjusted straps packs. Presently Sam appeared, trotting quickly breathing hard; heavy pack hoisted high shoulders, put head tall shapeless felt bag, called hat. In gloom looked much like dwarf. ‘I sure given heaviest stuff,’ said Frodo. ‘I pity snails, carry homes backs.’ ‘I could take lot yet, sir. My packet quite light,’ said Sam stoutly untruthfully. ‘No don’t, Sam!’ said Pippin. ‘It good him. He’s got nothing except ordered us pack. He’s slack lately, he’ll feel weight less he’s walked own.’ ‘Be kind poor old hobbit!’ laughed Frodo. ‘I shall thin willow-wand, I’m sure, I get Buckland. But I talking nonsense. I suspect taken share, Sam, I shall look next packing.’ He picked stick again. ‘Well, like walking dark,’ said, ‘so let’s put miles behind us bed.’ For short way followed lane westwards. Then leaving turned left took quietly fields again. They went single file along hedgerows borders coppices, night fell dark them. In dark cloaks invisible magic rings. Since hobbits, trying silent, made noise even hobbits would hear. Even wild things fields woods hardly noticed passing. After time crossed Water, west Hobbiton, narrow plank-bridge. The stream winding black ribbon, bordered leaning alder-trees. A mile two south hastily crossed great road Brandywine Bridge; Tookland bending south-eastwards made Green Hill Country. As began climb first slopes looked back saw lamps Hobbiton far twinkling gentle valley Water. Soon disappeared folds darkened land, followed Bywater beside grey pool. When light last farm far behind, peeping among trees, Frodo turned waved hand farewell. ‘I wonder I shall ever look valley again,’ said quietly. When walked three hours rested. The night clear, cool, starry, smoke-like wisps mist creeping hill-sides streams deep meadows. Thin-clad birches, swaying light wind heads, made black net pale sky. They ate frugal supper (for hobbits), went again. Soon struck narrow road, went rolling down, fading grey darkness ahead: road Woodhall, Stock, Bucklebury Ferry. It climbed away main road Water-valley, wound skirts Green Hills towards Woody End, wild corner Eastfarthing. After plunged deeply cloven track tall trees rustled dry leaves night. It dark. At first talked, hummed tune softly together, far away inquisitive ears. Then marched silence, Pippin began lag behind. At last, began climb steep slope, stopped yawned. ‘I sleepy,’ said, ‘that soon I shall fall road. Are going sleep legs? It nearly midnight.’ ‘I thought liked walking dark,’ said Frodo. ‘But great hurry. Merry expects us time day tomorrow; leaves us nearly two days more. We’ll halt first likely spot.’ ‘The wind’s West,’ said Sam. ‘If get side hill, shall find spot sheltered snug enough, sir. There dry fir-wood ahead, I remember rightly.’ Sam knew land well within twenty miles Hobbiton, limit geography. Just top hill came patch fir-wood. Leaving road went deep resinscented darkness trees, gathered dead sticks cones make fire. Soon merry crackle flame foot large fir-tree sat round while, began nod. Then, angle great tree’s roots, curled cloaks blankets, soon fast asleep. They set watch; even Frodo feared danger yet, still heart Shire. A creatures came looked fire died away. A fox passing wood business stopped several minutes sniffed. ‘Hobbits!’ thought. ‘Well, next? I heard strange doings land, I seldom heard hobbit sleeping doors tree. Three them! There’s something mighty queer behind this.’ He quite right, never found it. The morning came, pale clammy. Frodo woke first, found tree-root made hole back, neck stiff. ‘Walking pleasure! Why didn’t I drive?’ thought, usually beginning expedition. ‘And beautiful feather beds sold Sackville-Bagginses! These tree-roots would good.’ He stretched. ‘Wake up, hobbits!’ cried. ‘It’s beautiful morning.’ ‘What’s beautiful it?’ said Pippin, peering edge blanket one eye. ‘Sam! Get breakfast ready half-past nine! Have got bath-water hot?’ Sam jumped up, looking rather bleary. ‘No, sir, I haven’t, sir!’ said. Frodo stripped blankets Pippin rolled over, walked edge wood. Away eastward sun rising red mists lay thick world. Touched gold red autumn trees seemed sailing rootless shadowy sea. A little left road ran steeply hollow disappeared. When returned Sam Pippin got good fire going. ‘Water!’ shouted Pippin. ‘Where’s water?’ ‘I don’t keep water pockets,’ said Frodo. ‘We thought gone find some,’ said Pippin, busy setting food, cups. ‘You better go now.’ ‘You come too,’ said Frodo, ‘and bring waterbottles.’ There stream foot hill. They filled bottles small camping kettle little fall water fell feet outcrop grey stone. It icy cold; spluttered puffed bathed faces hands. When breakfast over, packs trussed again, ten o’clock, day beginning turn fine hot. They went slope, across stream dived road, next slope, another shoulder hills; time cloaks, blankets, water, food, gear already seemed heavy burden. The day’s march promised warm tiring work. After miles, however, road ceased roll down: climbed top steep bank weary zig-zagging sort way, prepared go last time. In front saw lower lands dotted small clumps trees melted away distance brown woodland haze. They looking across Woody End towards Brandywine River. The road wound away like piece string. ‘The road goes ever,’ said Pippin; ‘but I can’t without rest. It high time lunch.’ He sat bank side road looked away east haze, beyond lay River, end Shire spent life. Sam stood him. His round eyes wide open – looking across lands never seen new horizon. ‘Do Elves live woods?’ asked. ‘Not I ever heard,’ said Pippin. Frodo silent. He gazing eastward along road, never seen before. Suddenly spoke, aloud himself, saying slowly: The Road goes ever Down door began. Now far ahead Road gone, And I must follow, I can, Pursuing weary feet, Until joins larger way, Where many paths errands meet. And whither then? I cannot say. ‘That sounds like bit old Bilbo’s rhyming,’ said Pippin. ‘Or one imitations? It sound altogether encouraging.’ ‘I don’t know,’ said Frodo. ‘It came then, I making up; I may heard long ago. Certainly reminds much Bilbo last years, went away. He used often say one Road; like great river: springs every doorstep, every path tributary. ‘‘It’s dangerous business, Frodo, going door,’’ used say. ‘‘You step Road, don’t keep feet, knowing might swept to. Do realize path goes Mirkwood, let it, might take Lonely Mountain even worse places?’’ He used say path outside front door Bag End, especially long walk.’ ‘Well, Road won’t sweep anywhere hour least,’ said Pippin, unslinging pack. The others followed example, putting packs bank legs road. After rest good lunch, rest. The sun beginning get low light afternoon land went hill. So far met soul road. This way much used, hardly fit carts, little traffic Woody End. They jogging along hour Sam stopped moment listening. They level ground, road much winding lay straight ahead grass-land sprinkled tall trees, outliers approaching woods. ‘I hear pony horse coming along road behind,’ said Sam. They looked back, turn road prevented seeing far. ‘I wonder Gandalf coming us,’ said Frodo; even said it, feeling so, sudden desire hide view rider came him. ‘It may matter much,’ said apologetically, ‘but I would rather seen road – anyone. I sick doings noticed discussed. And Gandalf,’ added afterthought, ‘we give little surprise, pay late. Let’s get sight!’ The two ran quickly left little hollow far road. There lay flat. Frodo hesitated second: curiosity feeling struggling desire hide. The sound hoofs drew nearer. Just time threw patch long grass behind tree overshadowed road. Then lifted head peered cautiously one great roots. Round corner came black horse, hobbit-pony full-sized horse; sat large man, seemed crouch saddle, wrapped great black cloak hood, boots high stirrups showed below; face shadowed invisible. When reached tree level Frodo horse stopped. The riding figure sat quite still head bowed, listening. From inside hood came noise someone sniffing catch elusive scent; head turned side side road. A sudden unreasoning fear discovery laid hold Frodo, thought Ring. He hardly dared breathe, yet desire get pocket became strong began slowly move hand. He felt slip on, would safe. The advice Gandalf seemed absurd. Bilbo used Ring. ‘And I still Shire,’ thought, hand touched chain hung. At moment rider sat up, shook reins. The horse stepped forward, walking slowly first, breaking quick trot. Frodo crawled edge road watched rider, dwindled distance. He could quite sure, seemed suddenly, passed sight, horse turned aside went trees right. ‘Well, I call queer, indeed disturbing,’ said Frodo himself, walked towards companions. Pippin Sam remained flat grass, seen nothing; Frodo described rider strange behaviour. ‘I can’t say why, I felt certain looking smelling me; also I felt certain I want discover me. I’ve never seen felt anything like Shire before.’ ‘But one Big People got us?’ said Pippin. ‘And part world?’ ‘There Men about,’ said Frodo. ‘Down Southfarthing trouble Big People, I believe. But I never heard anything like rider. I wonder comes from.’ ‘Begging pardon,’ put Sam suddenly, ‘I know comes from. It’s Hobbiton black rider comes, unless there’s one. And I know he’s going to.’ ‘What mean?’ said Frodo sharply, looking astonishment. ‘Why didn’t speak before?’ ‘I remembered, sir. It like this: I got back hole yesterday evening key, dad, says me: Hallo, Sam! says. I thought away Mr. Frodo morning. There’s strange customer asking Mr. Baggins Bag End, he’s gone. I’ve sent Bucklebury. Not I liked sound him. He seemed mighty put out, I told Mr. Baggins left old home good. Hissed me, did. It gave quite shudder. What sort fellow he? says I Gaffer. I don’t know, says he; wasn’t hobbit. He tall black-like, stooped me. I reckon one Big Folk foreign parts. He spoke funny. ‘I couldn’t stay hear more, sir, since waiting; I didn’t give much heed myself. The Gaffer getting old, bit blind, must near dark fellow come Hill found taking air end Row. I hope hasn’t done harm, sir, me.’ ‘The Gaffer can’t blamed anyway,’ said Frodo. ‘As matter fact I heard talking stranger, seemed inquiring me, I nearly went asked was. I wish I had, told before. I might careful road.’ ‘Still, may connexion rider Gaffer’s stranger,’ said Pippin. ‘We left Hobbiton secretly enough, I don’t see could followed us.’ ‘What smelling, sir?’ said Sam. ‘And Gaffer said black chap.’ ‘I wish I waited Gandalf,’ Frodo muttered. ‘But perhaps would made matters worse.’ ‘Then know guess something rider?’ said Pippin, caught muttered words. ‘I don’t know, I would rather guess,’ said Frodo. ‘All right, cousin Frodo! You keep secret present, want mysterious. In meanwhile do? I like bite sup, somehow I think better move here. Your talk sniffing riders invisible noses unsettled me.’ ‘Yes, I think move now,’ said Frodo; ‘but road – case rider comes back, another follows him. We ought good step today. Buckland still miles away.’ The shadows trees long thin grass, started again. They kept stone’s throw left road, kept sight much could. But hindered them; grass thick tussocky, ground uneven, trees began draw together thickets. The sun gone red behind hills backs, evening coming came back road end long level run straight miles. At point bent left went lowlands Yale making Stock; lane branched right, winding wood ancient oak-trees way Woodhall. ‘That way us,’ said Frodo. Not far road-meeting came huge hulk tree: still alive leaves small branches put round broken stumps long-fallen limbs; hollow, could entered great crack side away road. The hobbits crept inside, sat upon floor old leaves decayed wood. They rested light meal, talking quietly listening time time. Twilight crept back lane. The West wind sighing branches. Leaves whispering. Soon road began fall gently steadily dusk. A star came trees darkening East them. They went abreast step, keep spirits. After time, stars grew thicker brighter, feeling disquiet left them, longer listened sound hoofs. They began hum softly, hobbits way walk along, especially drawing near home night. With hobbits supper-song bed-song; hobbits hummed walking-song (though not, course, without mention supper bed). Bilbo Baggins made words, tune old hills, taught Frodo walked lanes Water-valley talked Adventure. Upon hearth fire red, Beneath roof bed; But yet weary feet, Still round corner may meet A sudden tree standing stone That none seen alone. Tree flower leaf grass, Let pass! Let pass! Hill water sky, Pass by! Pass by! Still round corner may wait A new road secret gate, And though pass today, Tomorrow may come way And take hidden paths run Towards Moon Sun. Apple, thorn, nut sloe, Let go! Let go! Sand stone pool dell, Fare well! Fare well! Home behind, world ahead, And many paths tread Through shadows edge night, Until stars alight. Then world behind home ahead, We’ll wander back home bed. Mist twilight, cloud shade, Away shall fade! Away shall fade! Fire lamp, meat bread, And bed! And bed! The song ended. ‘And bed! And bed!’ sang Pippin high voice. ‘Hush!’ said Frodo. ‘I think I hear hoofs again.’ They stopped suddenly stood silent treeshadows, listening. There sound hoofs lane, way behind, coming slow clear wind. Quickly quietly slipped path, ran deeper shade oak-trees. ‘Don’t let us go far!’ said Frodo. ‘I don’t want seen, I want see another Black Rider.’ ‘Very well!’ said Pippin. ‘But don’t forget sniffing!’ The hoofs drew nearer. They time find hiding-place better general darkness trees; Sam Pippin crouched behind large tree-bole, Frodo crept back yards towards lane. It showed grey pale, line fading light wood. Above stars thick dim sky, moon. The sound hoofs stopped. As Frodo watched saw something dark pass across lighter space two trees, halt. It looked like black shade horse led smaller black shadow. The black shadow stood close point left path, swayed side side. Frodo thought heard sound snuffling. The shadow bent ground, began crawl towards him. Once desire slip Ring came Frodo; time stronger before. So strong that, almost realized doing, hand groping pocket. But moment came sound like mingled song laughter. Clear voices rose fell starlit air. The black shadow straightened retreated. It climbed shadowy horse seemed vanish across lane darkness side. Frodo breathed again. ‘Elves!’ exclaimed Sam hoarse whisper. ‘Elves, sir!’ He would burst trees dashed towards voices, pulled back. ‘Yes, Elves,’ said Frodo. ‘One meet sometimes Woody End. They don’t live Shire, wander spring autumn, lands away beyond Tower Hills. I thankful do! You see, Black Rider stopped actually crawling towards us song began. As soon heard voices slipped away.’ ‘What Elves?’ said Sam, excited trouble rider. ‘Can’t go see them?’ ‘Listen! They coming way,’ said Frodo. ‘We wait.’ The singing drew nearer. One clear voice rose others. It singing fair elven-tongue, Frodo knew little, others knew nothing. Yet sound blending melody seemed shape thought words partly understood. This song Frodo heard it: Snow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear! O Queen beyond Western Seas! O Light us wander Amid world woven trees! Gilthoniel! O Elbereth! Clear thy eyes bright thy breath! Snow-white! Snow-white! We sing thee In far land beyond Sea. O stars Sunless Year With shining hand sown, In windy fields bright clear We see silver blossom blown! O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! We still remember, dwell In far land beneath trees, Thy starlight Western Seas. The song ended. ‘These High Elves! They spoke name Elbereth!’ said Frodo amazement. ‘Few fairest folk ever seen Shire. Not many remain Middle-earth, east Great Sea. This indeed strange chance!’ The hobbits sat shadow wayside. Before long Elves came lane towards valley. They passed slowly, hobbits could see starlight glimmering hair eyes. They bore lights, yet walked shimmer, like light moon rim hills rises, seemed fall feet. They silent, last Elf passed turned looked towards hobbits laughed. ‘Hail, Frodo!’ cried. ‘You abroad late. Or perhaps lost?’ Then called aloud others, company stopped gathered round. ‘This indeed wonderful!’ said. ‘Three hobbits wood night! We seen thing since Bilbo went away. What meaning it?’ ‘The meaning it, fair people,’ said Frodo, ‘is simply seem going way are. I like walking stars. But I would welcome company.’ ‘But need company, hobbits dull,’ laughed. ‘And know go way you, know whither going?’ ‘And know name?’ asked Frodo return. ‘We know many things,’ said. ‘We seen often Bilbo, though may seen us.’ ‘Who you, lord?’ asked Frodo. ‘I Gildor,’ answered leader, Elf first hailed him. ‘Gildor Inglorion House Finrod. We Exiles, kindred long ago departed tarrying while, ere return Great Sea. But kinsfolk dwell still peace Rivendell. Come now, Frodo, tell us doing? For see shadow fear upon you.’ ‘O Wise People!’ interrupted Pippin eagerly. ‘Tell us Black Riders!’ ‘Black Riders?’ said low voices. ‘Why ask Black Riders?’ ‘Because two Black Riders overtaken us today, one done twice,’ said Pippin; ‘only little ago slipped away drew near.’ The Elves answer once, spoke together softly tongue. At length Gildor turned hobbits. ‘We speak here,’ said. ‘We think best come us. It custom, time take road, shall lodge us tonight, will.’ ‘O Fair Folk! This good fortune beyond hope,’ said Pippin. Sam speechless. ‘I thank indeed, Gildor Inglorion,’ said Frodo bowing. ‘Elen sı´la lu´menn’ omentielvo, star shines hour meeting,’ added High-elven speech. ‘Be careful, friends!’ cried Gildor laughing. ‘Speak secrets! Here scholar Ancient Tongue. Bilbo good master. Hail, Elf-friend!’ said, bowing Frodo. ‘Come friends join company! You best walk middle may stray. You may weary halt.’ ‘Why? Where going?’ asked Frodo. ‘For tonight go woods hills Woodhall. It miles, shall rest end it, shorten journey tomorrow.’ They marched silence, passed like shadows faint lights: Elves (even hobbits) could walk wished without sound footfall. Pippin soon began feel sleepy, staggered twice; time tall Elf side put arm saved fall. Sam walked along Frodo’s side, dream, expression face half fear half astonished joy. The woods either side became denser; trees younger thicker; lane went lower, running fold hills, many deep brakes hazel rising slopes either hand. At last Elves turned aside path. A green ride lay almost unseen thickets right; followed wound away back wooded slopes top shoulder hills stood lower land river-valley. Suddenly came shadow trees, lay wide space grass, grey night. On three sides woods pressed upon it; eastward ground fell steeply tops dark trees, growing bottom slope, feet. Beyond, low lands lay dim flat stars. Nearer hand lights twinkled village Woodhall. The Elves sat grass spoke together soft voices; seemed take notice hobbits. Frodo companions wrapped cloaks blankets, drowsiness stole them. The night grew on, lights valley went out. Pippin fell asleep, pillowed green hillock. Away high East swung Remmirath, Netted Stars, slowly mists red Borgil rose, glowing like jewel fire. Then shift airs mist drawn away like veil, leaned up, climbed rim world, Swordsman Sky, Menelvagor shining belt. The Elves burst song. Suddenly trees fire sprang red light. ‘Come!’ Elves called hobbits. ‘Come! Now time speech merriment!’ Pippin sat rubbed eyes. He shivered. ‘There fire hall, food hungry guests,’ said Elf standing him. At south end greensward opening. There green floor ran wood, formed wide space like hall, roofed boughs trees. Their great trunks ran like pillars side. In middle wood-fire blazing, upon tree-pillars torches lights gold silver burning steadily. The Elves sat round fire upon grass upon sawn rings old trunks. Some went fro bearing cups pouring drink; others brought food heaped plates dishes. ‘This poor fare,’ said hobbits; ‘for lodging greenwood far halls. If ever guests home, treat better.’ ‘It seems good enough birthday-party,’ said Frodo. Pippin afterwards recalled little either food drink, mind filled light upon elf-faces, sound voices various beautiful felt waking dream. But remembered bread, surpassing savour fair white loaf one starving; fruits sweet wildberries richer tended fruits gardens; drained cup filled fragrant draught, cool clear fountain, golden summer afternoon. Sam could never describe words, picture clearly himself, felt thought night, though remained memory one chief events life. The nearest ever got say: ‘Well, sir, I could grow apples like that, I would call gardener. But singing went heart, know I mean.’ Frodo sat, eating, drinking, talking delight; mind chiefly words spoken. He knew little elf-speech listened eagerly. Now spoke served thanked language. They smiled said laughing: ‘Here jewel among hobbits!’ After Pippin fell fast asleep, lifted borne away bower trees; laid upon soft bed slept rest night away. Sam refused leave master. When Pippin gone, came sat curled Frodo’s feet, last nodded closed eyes. Frodo remained long awake, talking Gildor. They spoke many things, old new, Frodo questioned Gildor much happenings wide world outside Shire. The tidings mostly sad ominous: gathering darkness, wars Men, flight Elves. At last Frodo asked question nearest heart: ‘Tell me, Gildor, ever seen Bilbo since left us?’ Gildor smiled. ‘Yes,’ answered. ‘Twice. He said farewell us spot. But I saw again, far here.’ He would say Bilbo, Frodo fell silent. ‘You ask tell much concerns yourself, Frodo,’ said Gildor. ‘But I already know little, I read face thought behind questions. You leaving Shire, yet doubt find seek, accomplish intend, ever return. Is so?’ ‘It is,’ said Frodo; ‘but I thought going secret known Gandalf faithful Sam.’ He looked Sam, snoring gently. ‘The secret reach Enemy us,’ said Gildor. ‘The Enemy?’ said Frodo. ‘Then know I leaving Shire?’ ‘I know reason Enemy pursuing you,’ answered Gildor; ‘but I perceive – strange indeed though seems me. And I warn peril behind you, upon either side.’ ‘You mean Riders? I feared servants Enemy. What Black Riders?’ ‘Has Gandalf told nothing?’ ‘Nothing creatures.’ ‘Then I think say – lest terror keep journey. For seems set time, indeed time. You must make haste, neither stay turn back; Shire longer protection you.’ ‘I cannot imagine information could terrifying hints warnings,’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘I knew danger lay ahead, course; I expect meet Shire. Can’t hobbit walk Water River peace?’ ‘But Shire,’ said Gildor. ‘Others dwelt hobbits were; others dwell hobbits more. The wide world you: fence in, cannot ever fence out.’ ‘I know – yet always seemed safe familiar. What I now? My plan leave Shire secretly, make way Rivendell; footsteps dogged, ever I get Buckland.’ ‘I think still follow plan,’ said Gildor. ‘I think Road prove hard courage. But desire clearer counsel, ask Gandalf. I know reason flight, therefore I know means pursuers assail you. These things Gandalf must know. I suppose see leave Shire?’ ‘I hope so. But another thing makes anxious. I expecting Gandalf many days. He come Hobbiton latest two nights ago; never appeared. Now I wondering happened. Should I wait him?’ Gildor silent moment. ‘I like news,’ said last. ‘That Gandalf late, bode well. But said: Do meddle affairs Wizards, subtle quick anger. The choice yours: go wait.’ ‘And also said,’ answered Frodo: ‘Go Elves counsel, say yes.’ ‘Is indeed?’ laughed Gildor. ‘Elves seldom give unguarded advice, advice dangerous gift, even wise wise, courses may run ill. But would you? You told concerning yourself; shall I choose better you? But demand advice, I friendship’s sake give it. I think go once, without delay; Gandalf come set out, I also advise this: go alone. Take friends trusty willing. Now grateful, I give counsel gladly. The Elves labours sorrows, little concerned ways hobbits, creatures upon earth. Our paths cross seldom, chance purpose. In meeting may chance; purpose clear me, I fear say much.’ ‘I deeply grateful,’ said Frodo; ‘but I wish would tell plainly Black Riders are. If I take advice I may see Gandalf long while, I ought know danger pursues me.’ ‘Is enough know servants Enemy?’ answered Gildor. ‘Flee them! Speak words them! They deadly. Ask me! But heart forbodes that, ere ended, you, Frodo son Drogo, know fell things Gildor Inglorion. May Elbereth protect you!’ ‘But shall I find courage?’ asked Frodo. ‘That I chiefly need.’ ‘Courage found unlikely places,’ said Gildor. ‘Be good hope! Sleep now! In morning shall gone; send messages lands. The Wandering Companies shall know journey, power good shall watch. I name Elf-friend; may stars shine upon end road! Seldom delight strangers, fair hear words Ancient Speech lips wanderers world.’ Frodo felt sleep coming upon him, even Gildor finished speaking. ‘I sleep now,’ said; Elf led bower beside Pippin, threw upon bed fell dreamless slumber. Chapter 4 A SHORT CUT TO MUSHROOMS In morning Frodo woke refreshed. He lying bower made living tree branches laced drooping ground; bed fern grass, deep soft strangely fragrant. The sun shining fluttering leaves, still green upon tree. He jumped went out. Sam sitting grass near edge wood. Pippin standing studying sky weather. There sign Elves. ‘They left us fruit drink, bread,’ said Pippin. ‘Come breakfast. The bread tastes almost good last night. I want leave any, Sam insisted.’ Frodo sat beside Sam began eat. ‘What plan today?’ asked Pippin. ‘To walk Bucklebury quickly possible,’ answered Frodo, gave attention food. ‘Do think shall see anything Riders?’ asked Pippin cheerfully. Under morning sun prospect seeing whole troop seem alarming him. ‘Yes, probably,’ said Frodo, liking reminder. ‘But I hope get across river without seeing us.’ ‘Did find anything Gildor?’ ‘Not much – hints riddles,’ said Frodo evasively. ‘Did ask sniffing?’ ‘We didn’t discuss it,’ said Frodo mouth full. ‘You have. I sure important.’ ‘In case I sure Gildor would refused explain it,’ said Frodo sharply. ‘And leave peace bit! I don’t want answer string questions I eating. I want think!’ ‘Good heavens!’ said Pippin. ‘At breakfast?’ He walked away towards edge green. From Frodo’s mind bright morning – treacherously bright, thought – banished fear pursuit; pondered words Gildor. The merry voice Pippin came him. He running green turf singing. ‘No! I could not!’ said himself. ‘It one thing take young friends walking Shire me, hungry weary, food bed sweet. To take exile, hunger weariness may cure, quite another – even willing come. The inheritance mine alone. I don’t think I ought even take Sam.’ He looked Sam Gamgee, discovered Sam watching him. ‘Well, Sam!’ said. ‘What it? I leaving Shire soon ever I – fact I made mind even wait day Crickhollow, helped.’ ‘Very good, sir!’ ‘You still mean come me?’ ‘I do.’ ‘It going dangerous, Sam. It already dangerous. Most likely neither us come back.’ ‘If don’t come back, sir, I shan’t, that’s certain,’ said Sam. ‘Don’t leave him! said me. Leave him! I said. I never mean to. I going him, climbs Moon; Black Riders try stop him, they’ll Sam Gamgee reckon with, I said. They laughed.’ ‘Who they, talking about?’ ‘The Elves, sir. We talk last night; seemed know going away, I didn’t see use denying it. Wonderful folk, Elves, sir! Wonderful!’ ‘They are,’ said Frodo. ‘Do like still, closer view?’ ‘They seem bit likes dislikes, speak,’ answered Sam slowly. ‘It don’t seem matter I think them. They quite different I expected – old young, gay sad, were.’ Frodo looked Sam rather startled, half expecting see outward sign odd change seemed come him. It sound like voice old Sam Gamgee thought knew. But looked like old Sam Gamgee sitting there, except face unusually thoughtful. ‘Do feel need leave Shire – wish see come true already?’ asked. ‘Yes, sir. I don’t know say it, last night I feel different. I seem see ahead, kind way. I know going take long road, darkness; I know I can’t turn back. It isn’t see Elves now, dragons, mountains, I want – I don’t rightly know I want: I something end, lies ahead, Shire. I must see through, sir, understand me.’ ‘I don’t altogether. But I understand Gandalf chose good companion. I content. We go together.’ Frodo finished breakfast silence. Then standing looked land ahead, called Pippin. ‘All ready start?’ said Pippin ran up. ‘We must getting once. We slept late; good many miles go.’ ‘You slept late, mean,’ said Pippin. ‘I long before; waiting finish eating thinking.’ ‘I finished now. And I going make Bucklebury Ferry quickly possible. I going way, back road left last night: I going cut straight across country here.’ ‘Then going fly,’ said Pippin. ‘You won’t cut straight foot anywhere country.’ ‘We cut straighter road anyway,’ answered Frodo. ‘The Ferry east Woodhall; hard road curves away left – see bend away north there. It goes round north end Marish strike causeway Bridge Stock. But miles way. We could save quarter distance made line Ferry stand.’ ‘Short cuts make long delays,’ argued Pippin. ‘The country rough round here, bogs kinds difficulties Marish – I know land parts. And worrying Black Riders, I can’t see worse meeting road wood field.’ ‘It less easy find people woods fields,’ answered Frodo. ‘And supposed road, chance looked road it.’ ‘All right!’ said Pippin. ‘I follow every bog ditch. But hard! I counted passing Golden Perch Stock sundown. The best beer Eastfarthing, used be: long time since I tasted it.’ ‘That settles it!’ said Frodo. ‘Short cuts make delays, inns make longer ones. At costs must keep away Golden Perch. We want get Bucklebury dark. What say, Sam?’ ‘I go along you, Mr. Frodo,’ said Sam (in spite private misgivings deep regret best beer Eastfarthing). ‘Then going toil bog briar, let’s go now!’ said Pippin. It already nearly hot day before; clouds beginning come West. It looked likely turn rain. The hobbits scrambled steep green bank plunged thick trees below. Their course chosen leave Woodhall left, cut slanting woods clustered along eastern side hills, reached flats beyond. Then could make straight Ferry country open, except ditches fences. Frodo reckoned eighteen miles go straight line. He soon found thicket closer tangled appeared. There paths undergrowth, get fast. When struggled bottom bank, found stream running hills behind deeply dug bed steep slippery sides overhung brambles. Most inconveniently cut across line chosen. They could jump it, indeed get across without getting wet, scratched, muddy. They halted, wondering do. ‘First check!’ said Pippin, smiling grimly. Sam Gamgee looked back. Through opening trees caught glimpse top green bank climbed down. ‘Look!’ said, clutching Frodo arm. They looked, edge high saw sky horse standing. Beside stooped black figure. They gave idea going back. Frodo led way, plunged quickly thick bushes beside stream. ‘Whew!’ said Pippin. ‘We right! The short cut gone crooked already; got cover time. You’ve got sharp ears, Sam: hear anything coming?’ They stood still, almost holding breath listened; sound pursuit. ‘I don’t fancy would try bringing horse bank,’ said Sam. ‘But I guess knows came it. We better going on.’ Going altogether easy. They packs carry, bushes brambles reluctant let through. They cut wind ridge behind, air still stuffy. When forced way last open ground, hot tired scratched, also longer certain direction going. The banks stream sank, reached levels became broader shallower, wandering towards Marish River. ‘Why, Stock-brook!’ said Pippin. ‘If going try get back course, must cross bear right.’ They waded stream, hurried wide open space, rush-grown treeless, side. Beyond came belt trees: tall oaks, part, elm tree ash. The ground fairly level, little undergrowth; trees close see far ahead. The leaves blew upwards sudden gusts wind, spots rain began fall overcast sky. Then wind died away rain came streaming down. They trudged along fast could, patches grass, thick drifts old leaves; rain pattered trickled. They talk, kept glancing back, side side. After half hour Pippin said: ‘I hope turned much towards south, walking longwise wood! It broad belt – I said mile widest – ought now.’ ‘It good starting go zig-zags,’ said Frodo. ‘That won’t mend matters. Let us keep going! I sure I want come open yet.’ They went perhaps another couple miles. Then sun gleamed ragged clouds rain lessened. It past mid-day, felt high time lunch. They halted elm tree: leaves though fast turning yellow still thick, ground feet fairly dry sheltered. When came make meal, found Elves filled bottles clear drink, pale golden colour: scent honey made many flowers, wonderfully refreshing. Very soon laughing, snapping fingers rain, Black Riders. The last miles, felt, would soon behind them. Frodo propped back tree-trunk, closed eyes. Sam Pippin sat near, began hum, sing softly: Ho! Ho! Ho! bottle I go To heal heart drown woe. Rain may fall wind may blow, And many miles still go, But tall tree I lie, And let clouds go sailing by. Ho! Ho! Ho! began louder. They stopped short suddenly. Frodo sprang feet. A long-drawn wail came wind, like cry evil lonely creature. It rose fell, ended high piercing note. Even sat stood, suddenly frozen, answered another cry, fainter off, less chilling blood. There silence, broken sound wind leaves. ‘And think was?’ Pippin asked last, trying speak lightly, quavering little. ‘If bird, one I never heard Shire before.’ ‘It bird beast,’ said Frodo. ‘It call, signal – words cry, though I could catch them. But hobbit voice.’ No said it. They thinking Riders, one spoke them. They reluctant either stay go on; sooner later got get across open country Ferry, best go sooner daylight. In moments shouldered packs off. Before long wood came sudden end. Wide grasslands stretched them. They saw had, fact, turned much south. Away flats could glimpse low hill Bucklebury across River, left. Creeping cautiously edge trees, set across open quickly could. At first felt afraid, away shelter wood. Far back behind stood high place breakfasted. Frodo half expected see small distant figure horseman ridge dark sky; sign one. The sun escaping breaking clouds, sank towards hills left, shining brightly again. Their fear left them, though still felt uneasy. But land became steadily tame well-ordered. Soon came well-tended fields meadows: hedges gates dikes drainage. Everything seemed quiet peaceful, ordinary corner Shire. Their spirits rose every step. The line River grew nearer; Black Riders began seem like phantoms woods left far behind. They passed along edge huge turnip-field, came stout gate. Beyond rutted lane ran low well-laid hedges towards distant clump trees. Pippin stopped. ‘I know fields gate!’ said. ‘This Bamfurlong, old Farmer Maggot’s land. That’s farm away trees.’ ‘One trouble another!’ said Frodo, looking nearly much alarmed Pippin declared lane slot leading dragon’s den. The others looked surprise. ‘What’s wrong old Maggot?’ asked Pippin. ‘He’s good friend Brandybucks. Of course he’s terror trespassers, keeps ferocious dogs – all, folk near border guard.’ ‘I know,’ said Frodo. ‘But same,’ added shamefaced laugh, ‘I terrified dogs. I avoided farm years years. He caught several times trespassing mushrooms, I youngster Brandy Hall. On last occasion beat me, took showed dogs. ‘‘See, lads,’’ said, ‘‘next time young varmint sets foot land, eat him. Now see off!’’ They chased way Ferry. I never got fright – though I daresay beasts knew business would really touched me.’ Pippin laughed. ‘Well, it’s time made up. Especially coming back live Buckland. Old Maggot really stout fellow – leave mushrooms alone. Let’s get lane shan’t trespassing. If meet him, I’ll talking. He friend Merry’s, I used come good deal one time.’ They went along lane, saw thatched roofs large house farm-buildings peeping among trees ahead. The Maggots, Puddifoots Stock, inhabitants Marish, house-dwellers; farm stoutly built brick high wall round it. There wide wooden gate opening wall lane. Suddenly drew nearer terrific baying barking broke out, loud voice heard shouting: ‘Grip! Fang! Wolf! Come on, lads!’ Frodo Sam stopped dead, Pippin walked paces. The gate opened three huge dogs came pelting lane, dashed towards travellers, barking fiercely. They took notice Pippin; Sam shrank wall, two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed suspiciously, snarled moved. The largest ferocious three halted front Frodo, bristling growling. Through gate appeared broad thick-set hobbit round red face. ‘Hallo! Hallo! And may be, may wanting?’ asked. ‘Good afternoon, Mr. Maggot!’ said Pippin. The farmer looked closely. ‘Well, isn’t Master Pippin – Mr. Peregrin Took, I say!’ cried, changing scowl grin. ‘It’s long time since I saw round here. It’s lucky I know you. I going set dogs strangers. There funny things going today. Of course, get queer folk wandering parts times. Too near River,’ said, shaking head. ‘But fellow outlandish I ever set eyes on. He won’t cross land without leave second time, I stop it.’ ‘What fellow mean?’ asked Pippin. ‘Then haven’t seen him?’ said farmer. ‘He went lane towards causeway long back. He funny customer asking funny questions. But perhaps you’ll come along inside, we’ll pass news comfortable. I’ve drop good ale tap, friends willing, Mr. Took.’ It seemed plain farmer would tell more, allowed time fashion, accepted invitation. ‘What dogs?’ asked Frodo anxiously. The farmer laughed. ‘They won’t harm – unless I tell ’em to. Here, Grip! Fang! Heel!’ cried. ‘Heel, Wolf!’ To relief Frodo Sam, dogs walked away let go free. Pippin introduced two farmer. ‘Mr. Frodo Baggins,’ said. ‘You may remember him, used live Brandy Hall.’ At name Baggins farmer started, gave Frodo sharp glance. For moment Frodo thought memory stolen mushrooms aroused, dogs would told see off. But Farmer Maggot took arm. ‘Well, isn’t queerer ever!’ exclaimed. ‘Mr. Baggins it? Come inside! We must talk.’ They went farmer’s kitchen, sat wide fire-place. Mrs. Maggot brought beer huge jug, filled four large mugs. It good brew, Pippin found compensated missing Golden Perch. Sam sipped beer suspiciously. He natural mistrust inhabitants parts Shire; also disposed quick friends anyone beaten master, however long ago. After remarks weather agricultural prospects (which worse usual), Farmer Maggot put mug looked turn. ‘Now, Mr. Peregrin,’ said, ‘where might coming from, might going to? Were coming visit me? For, so, gone past gate without seeing you.’ ‘Well, no,’ answered Pippin. ‘To tell truth, since guessed it, got lane end: come fields. But quite accident. We lost way woods, back near Woodhall, trying take short cut Ferry.’ ‘If hurry, road would served better,’ said farmer. ‘But I wasn’t worrying that. You leave walk land, mind, Mr. Peregrin. And you, Mr. Baggins – though I daresay still like mushrooms.’ He laughed. ‘Ah yes, I recognized name. I recollect time young Frodo Baggins one worst young rascals Buckland. But wasn’t mushrooms I thinking of. I heard name Baggins turned up. What think funny customer asked me?’ They waited anxiously go on. ‘Well,’ farmer continued, approaching point slow relish, ‘he came riding big black horse gate, happened open, right door. All black himself, too, cloaked hooded up, want known. ‘‘Now Shire want?’’ I thought myself. We don’t see many Big Folk border; anyway I never heard like black fellow. ‘‘‘Good-day you!’’ I says, going him. ‘‘This lane don’t lead anywhere, wherever may going, quickest way back road.’’ I didn’t like looks him; Grip came out, took one sniff let yelp stung: put tail bolted howling. The black fellow sat quite still. ‘‘‘I come yonder,’’ said, slow stiff-like, pointing back west, fields, please. ‘‘Have seen Baggins?’’ asked queer voice, bent towards me. I could see face, hood fell low; I felt sort shiver back. But I see come riding land bold. ‘‘‘Be off!’’ I said. ‘‘There Bagginses here. You’re wrong part Shire. You better go back west Hobbiton – go road time.’’ ‘‘‘Baggins left,’’ answered whisper. ‘‘He coming. He far away. I wish find him. If passes tell me? I come back gold.’’ ‘‘‘No won’t,’’ I said. ‘‘You’ll go back belong, double quick. I give one minute I call dogs.’’ ‘He gave sort hiss. It might laughing, might not. Then spurred great horse right me, I jumped way time. I called dogs, swung off, rode gate lane towards causeway like bolt thunder. What think that?’ Frodo sat moment looking fire, thought earth would reach Ferry. ‘I don’t know think,’ said last. ‘Then I’ll tell think,’ said Maggot. ‘You never gone mixing Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo. Folk queer there.’ Sam stirred chair, looked farmer unfriendly eye. ‘But always reckless lad. When I heard left Brandybucks gone old Mr. Bilbo, I said going find trouble. Mark words, comes strange doings Mr. Bilbo’s. His money got strange fashion foreign parts, say. Maybe want know become gold jewels buried hill Hobbiton, I hear?’ Frodo said nothing: shrewd guesses farmer rather disconcerting. ‘Well, Mr. Frodo,’ Maggot went on, ‘I’m glad you’ve sense come back Buckland. My advice is: stay there! And don’t get mixed outlandish folk. You’ll friends parts. If black fellows come again, I’ll deal them. I’ll say you’re dead, left Shire, anything like. And might true enough; like old Mr. Bilbo want news of.’ ‘Maybe you’re right,’ said Frodo, avoiding farmer’s eye staring fire. Maggot looked thoughtfully. ‘Well, I see ideas own,’ said. ‘It plain nose accident brought rider afternoon; maybe news great news you, all. I asking tell anything mind keep yourself; I see kind trouble. Perhaps thinking won’t easy get Ferry without caught?’ ‘I thinking so,’ said Frodo. ‘But got try get there; won’t done sitting thinking. So I afraid must going. Thank much indeed kindness! I’ve terror dogs thirty years, Farmer Maggot, though may laugh hear it. It’s pity: I’ve missed good friend. And I’m sorry leave soon. But I’ll come back, perhaps, one day – I get chance.’ ‘You’ll welcome come,’ said Maggot. ‘But I’ve notion. It’s near sundown already, going supper; mostly go bed soon Sun. If Mr. Peregrin could stay bite us, would pleased!’ ‘And we!’ said Frodo. ‘But must going once, I’m afraid. Even dark reach Ferry.’ ‘Ah! wait minute! I going say: bit supper, I’ll get small waggon, I’ll drive Ferry. That save good step, might also save trouble another sort.’ Frodo accepted invitation gratefully, relief Pippin Sam. The sun already behind western hills, light failing. Two Maggot’s sons three daughters came in, generous supper laid large table. The kitchen lit candles fire mended. Mrs. Maggot bustled out. One two hobbits belonging farm-household came in. In short fourteen sat eat. There beer plenty, mighty dish mushrooms bacon, besides much solid farmhouse fare. The dogs lay fire gnawed rinds cracked bones. When finished, farmer sons went lantern got waggon ready. It dark yard, guests came out. They threw packs board climbed in. The farmer sat driving-seat, whipped two stout ponies. His wife stood light open door. ‘You careful yourself, Maggot!’ called. ‘Don’t go arguing foreigners, come straight back!’ ‘I will!’ said he, drove gate. There breath wind stirring; night still quiet, chill air. They went without lights took slowly. After mile two lane came end, crossing deep dike, climbing short slope highbanked causeway. Maggot got took good look either way, north south, nothing could seen darkness, sound still air. Thin strands river-mist hanging dikes, crawling fields. ‘It’s going thick,’ said Maggot; ‘but I’ll light lanterns till I turn home. We’ll hear anything road long meet tonight.’ * * * It five miles Maggot’s lane Ferry. The hobbits wrapped up, ears strained sound creak wheels slow clop ponies’ hoofs. The waggon seemed slower snail Frodo. Beside Pippin nodding towards sleep; Sam staring forwards rising fog. They reached entrance Ferry lane last. It marked two tall white posts suddenly loomed right. Farmer Maggot drew ponies waggon creaked halt. They beginning scramble out, suddenly heard dreading: hoofs road ahead. The sound coming towards them. Maggot jumped stood holding ponies’ heads, peering forward gloom. Clip-clop, clip-clop came approaching rider. The fall hoofs sounded loud still, foggy air. ‘You’d better hidden, Mr. Frodo,’ said Sam anxiously. ‘You get waggon cover blankets, we’ll send rider rightabouts!’ He climbed went farmer’s side. Black Riders would ride get near waggon. Clop-clop, clop-clop. The rider nearly them. ‘Hallo there!’ called Farmer Maggot. The advancing hoofs stopped short. They thought could dimly guess dark cloaked shape mist, yard two ahead. ‘Now then!’ said farmer, throwing reins Sam striding forward. ‘Don’t come step nearer! What want, going?’ ‘I want Mr. Baggins. Have seen him?’ said muffled voice – voice voice Merry Brandybuck. A dark lantern uncovered, light fell astonished face farmer. ‘Mr. Merry!’ cried. ‘Yes, course! Who think was?’ said Merry coming forward. As came mist fears subsided, seemed suddenly diminish ordinary hobbitsize. He riding pony, scarf swathed round neck chin keep fog. Frodo sprang waggon greet him. ‘So last!’ said Merry. ‘I beginning wonder would turn today, I going back supper. When grew foggy I came across rode towards Stock see fallen ditches. But I’m blest I know way come. Where find them, Mr. Maggot? In duck-pond?’ ‘No, I caught ’em trespassing,’ said farmer, ‘and nearly set dogs ’em; they’ll tell story, I’ve doubt. Now, you’ll excuse me, Mr. Merry Mr. Frodo all, I’d best turning home. Mrs. Maggot worriting night getting thick.’ He backed waggon lane turned it. ‘Well, good night all,’ said. ‘It’s queer day, mistake. But all’s well ends well; though perhaps say reach doors. I’ll deny I’ll glad I do.’ He lit lanterns, got up. Suddenly produced large basket seat. ‘I nearly forgetting,’ said. ‘Mrs. Maggot put Mr. Baggins, compliments.’ He handed moved off, followed chorus thanks good-nights. They watched pale rings light round lanterns dwindled foggy night. Suddenly Frodo laughed: covered basket held, scent mushrooms rising. Chapter 5 A CONSPIRACY UNMASKED ‘Now better get home ourselves,’ said Merry. ‘There’s something funny this, I see; must wait till get in.’ They turned Ferry lane, straight well-kept edged large white-washed stones. In hundred yards brought river-bank, broad wooden landing-stage. A large flat ferryboat moored beside it. The white bollards near water’s edge glimmered light two lamps high posts. Behind mists flat fields hedges; water dark, curling wisps like steam among reeds bank. There seemed less fog side. Merry led pony gangway ferry, others followed. Merry pushed slowly long pole. The Brandywine flowed slow broad them. On side bank steep, winding path climbed landing. Lamps twinkling there. Behind loomed Buck Hill; it, stray shrouds mist, shone many round windows, yellow red. They windows Brandy Hall, ancient home Brandybucks. Long ago Gorhendad Oldbuck, head Oldbuck family, one oldest Marish indeed Shire, crossed river, original boundary land eastwards. He built (and excavated) Brandy Hall, changed name Brandybuck, settled become master virtually small independent country. His family grew grew, days continued grow, Brandy Hall occupied whole low hill, three large front-doors, many side-doors, hundred windows. The Brandybucks numerous dependants began burrow, later build, round about. That origin Buckland, thickly inhabited strip river Old Forest, sort colony Shire. Its chief village Bucklebury, clustering banks slopes behind Brandy Hall. The people Marish friendly Bucklanders, authority Master Hall (as head Brandybuck family called) still acknowledged farmers Stock Rushey. But folk old Shire regarded Bucklanders peculiar, half foreigners were. Though, matter fact, different hobbits Four Farthings. Except one point: fond boats, could swim. Their land originally unprotected East; side built hedge: High Hay. It planted many generations ago, thick tall, constantly tended. It ran way Brandywine Bridge, big loop curving away river, Haysend (where Withywindle flowed Forest Brandywine): well twenty miles end end. But, course, complete protection. The Forest drew close hedge many places. The Bucklanders kept doors locked dark, also usual Shire. The ferry-boat moved slowly across water. The Buckland shore drew nearer. Sam member party river before. He strange feeling slow gurgling stream slipped by: old life lay behind mists, dark adventure lay front. He scratched head, moment passing wish Mr. Frodo could gone living quietly Bag End. The four hobbits stepped ferry. Merry tying up, Pippin already leading pony path, Sam (who looking back, take farewell Shire) said hoarse whisper: ‘Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do see anything?’ On far stage, distant lamps, could make figure: looked like dark black bundle left behind. But looked seemed move sway way that, searching ground. It crawled, went crouching, back gloom beyond lamps. ‘What Shire that?’ exclaimed Merry. ‘Something following us,’ said Frodo. ‘But don’t ask now! Let’s get away once!’ They hurried path top bank, looked back far shore shrouded mist, nothing could seen. ‘Thank goodness don’t keep boats westbank!’ said Frodo. ‘Can horses cross river?’ ‘They go ten miles north Brandywine Bridge – might swim,’ answered Merry. ‘Though I never heard horse swimming Brandywine. But horses it?’ ‘I’ll tell later. Let’s get indoors talk.’ ‘All right! You Pippin know way; I’ll ride tell Fatty Bolger coming. We’ll see supper things.’ ‘We supper early Farmer Maggot,’ said Frodo; ‘but could another.’ ‘You shall it! Give basket!’ said Merry, rode ahead darkness. It distance Brandywine Frodo’s new house Crickhollow. They passed Buck Hill Brandy Hall left, outskirts Bucklebury struck main road Buckland ran south Bridge. Half mile northward along came lane opening right. This followed couple miles climbed country. At last came narrow gate thick hedge. Nothing could seen house dark: stood back lane middle wide circle lawn surrounded belt low trees inside outer hedge. Frodo chosen it, stood out-of-the-way corner country, dwellings close by. You could get without noticed. It built long Brandybucks, use guests, members family wished escape crowded life Brandy Hall time. It oldfashioned countrified house, much like hobbit-hole possible: long low, upper storey; roof turf, round windows, large round door. As walked green path gate light visible; windows dark shuttered. Frodo knocked door, Fatty Bolger opened it. A friendly light streamed out. They slipped quickly shut light inside. They wide hall doors either side; front passage ran back middle house. ‘Well, think it?’ asked Merry coming passage. ‘We done best short time make look like home. After Fatty I got last cart-load yesterday.’ Frodo looked round. It look like home. Many favourite things – Bilbo’s things (they reminded sharply new setting) – arranged nearly possible Bag End. It pleasant, comfortable, welcoming place; found wishing really coming settle quiet retirement. It seemed unfair put friends trouble; wondered going break news must leave soon, indeed once. Yet would done night, went bed. ‘It’s delightful!’ said effort. ‘I hardly feel I moved all.’ * * * The travellers hung cloaks, piled packs floor. Merry led passage threw open door far end. Firelight came out, puff steam. ‘A bath!’ cried Pippin. ‘O blessed Meriadoc!’ ‘Which order shall go in?’ said Frodo. ‘Eldest first, quickest first? You’ll last either way, Master Peregrin.’ ‘Trust arrange things better that!’ said Merry. ‘We can’t begin life Crickhollow quarrel baths. In room three tubs, copper full boiling water. There also towels, mats soap. Get inside, quick!’ Merry Fatty went kitchen side passage, busied final preparations late supper. Snatches competing songs came bathroom mixed sound splashing wallowing. The voice Pippin suddenly lifted others one Bilbo’s favourite bath-songs. Sing hey! bath close day washes weary mud away! A loon sing: O! Water Hot noble thing! O! Sweet sound falling rain, brook leaps hill plain; better rain rippling streams Water Hot smokes steams. O! Water cold may pour need thirsty throat glad indeed; better Beer, drink lack, Water Hot poured back. O! Water fair leaps high fountain white beneath sky; never fountain sound sweet splashing Hot Water feet! There terrific splash, shout Whoa! Frodo. It appeared lot Pippin’s bath imitated fountain leaped high. Merry went door: ‘What supper beer throat?’ called. Frodo came drying hair. ‘There’s much water air I’m coming kitchen finish,’ said. ‘Lawks!’ said Merry, looking in. The stone floor swimming. ‘You ought mop get anything eat, Peregrin,’ said. ‘Hurry up, shan’t wait you.’ They supper kitchen table near fire. ‘I suppose three won’t want mushrooms again?’ said Fredegar without much hope. ‘Yes shall!’ cried Pippin. ‘They’re mine!’ said Frodo. ‘Given Mrs. Maggot, queen among farmers’ wives. Take greedy hands away, I’ll serve them.’ Hobbits passion mushrooms, surpassing even greediest likings Big People. A fact partly explains young Frodo’s long expeditions renowned fields Marish, wrath injured Maggot. On occasion plenty all, even according hobbit standards. There also many things follow, finished even Fatty Bolger heaved sigh content. They pushed back table, drew chairs round fire. ‘We’ll clear later,’ said Merry. ‘Now tell it! I guess adventures, quite fair without me. I want full account; I want know matter old Maggot, spoke like that. He sounded almost scared, possible.’ ‘We scared,’ said Pippin pause, Frodo stared fire speak. ‘You would been, too, chased two days Black Riders.’ ‘And they?’ ‘Black figures riding black horses,’ answered Pippin. ‘If Frodo won’t talk, I tell whole tale beginning.’ He gave full account journey time left Hobbiton. Sam gave various supporting nods exclamations. Frodo remained silent. ‘I think making up,’ said Merry, ‘if I seen black shape landing-stage – heard queer sound Maggot’s voice. What make all, Frodo?’ ‘Cousin Frodo close,’ said Pippin. ‘But time come open out. So far given nothing go Farmer Maggot’s guess something old Bilbo’s treasure.’ ‘That guess,’ said Frodo hastily. ‘Maggot know anything.’ ‘Old Maggot shrewd fellow,’ said Merry. ‘A lot goes behind round face come talk. I’ve heard used go Old Forest one time, reputation knowing good many strange things. But least tell us, Frodo, whether think guess good bad.’ ‘I think,’ answered Frodo slowly, ‘that good guess, far goes. There connexion Bilbo’s old adventures, Riders looking, perhaps one ought say searching, me. I also fear, want know, joke all; I safe anywhere else.’ He looked round windows walls, afraid would suddenly give way. The others looked silence, exchanged meaning glances among themselves. ‘It’s coming minute,’ whispered Pippin Merry. Merry nodded. ‘Well!’ said Frodo last, sitting straightening back, made decision. ‘I can’t keep dark longer. I got something tell all. But I don’t know quite begin.’ ‘I think I could help you,’ said Merry quietly, ‘by telling myself.’ ‘What mean?’ said Frodo, looking anxiously. ‘Just this, dear old Frodo: miserable, don’t know say good-bye. You meant leave Shire, course. But danger come sooner expected,andnowyouaremakingupyourmindtogoatonce. And don’t want to. We sorry you.’ Frodo opened mouth shut again. His look surprise comical laughed. ‘Dear old Frodo!’ said Pippin. ‘Did really think thrown dust eyes? You nearly careful clever enough that! You obviously planning go saying farewell haunts year since April. We constantly heard muttering: ‘‘Shall I ever look valley again, I wonder’’, things like that. And pretending come end money, actually selling beloved Bag End SackvilleBagginses! And close talks Gandalf.’ ‘Good heavens!’ said Frodo. ‘I thought I careful clever. I don’t know Gandalf would say. Is Shire discussing departure then?’ ‘Oh no!’ said Merry. ‘Don’t worry that! The secret won’t keep long, course; present is, I think, known us conspirators. After all, must remember know well, often you. We usually guess thinking. I knew Bilbo, too. To tell truth, I watching rather closely ever since left. I thought would go sooner later; indeed I expected go sooner, lately anxious. We terrified might give us slip, go suddenly, like did. Ever since spring kept eyes open, done good deal planning account. You going escape easily!’ ‘But I must go,’ said Frodo. ‘It cannot helped, dear friends. It wretched us all, use trying keep me. Since guessed much, please help hinder me!’ ‘You understand!’ said Pippin. ‘You must go – therefore must, too. Merry I coming you. Sam excellent fellow, would jump dragon’s throat save you, trip feet; need one companion dangerous adventure.’ ‘My dear beloved hobbits!’ said Frodo deeply moved. ‘But I could allow it. I decided long ago, too. You speak danger, understand. This treasure-hunt, there-and-back journey. I flying deadly peril deadly peril.’ ‘Of course understand,’ said Merry firmly. ‘That decided come. We know Ring laughing-matter; going best help Enemy.’ ‘The Ring!’ said Frodo, completely amazed. ‘Yes, Ring,’ said Merry. ‘My dear old hobbit, don’t allow inquisitiveness friends. I known existence Ring years – Bilbo went away, fact; since obviously regarded secret, I kept knowledge head, formed conspiracy. I know Bilbo, course, well I know you; I young, also careful – careful enough. If want know I first found out, I tell you.’ ‘Go on!’ said Frodo faintly. ‘ItwastheSackville-Bagginsesthatwerehisdownfall,asyou might expect. One day, year Party, I happened walking along road, I saw Bilbo ahead. Suddenly distance S.-B.s appeared, coming towards us. Bilbo slowed down, hey presto! vanished. I startled I hardly wits hide ordinary fashion; I got hedge walked along field inside. I peeping road, S.-B.s passed, looking straight Bilbo suddenly reappeared. I caught glint gold put something back trouser-pocket. ‘After I kept eyes open. In fact, I confess I spied. But must admit intriguing, I teens. I must one Shire, besides Frodo, ever seen old fellow’s secret book.’ ‘You read book!’ cried Frodo. ‘Good heavens above! Is nothing safe?’ ‘Not safe, I say,’ said Merry. ‘But I one rapid glance, difficult get. He never left book about. I wonder became it. I like another look. Have got it, Frodo?’ ‘No. It Bag End. He must taken away.’ ‘Well, I saying,’ Merry proceeded, ‘I kept knowledge myself, till spring things got serious. Then formed conspiracy; serious, too, meant business, scrupulous. You easy nut crack, Gandalf worse. But want introduced chief investigator, I produce him.’ ‘Where he?’ said Frodo, looking round, expected masked sinister figure come cupboard. ‘Step forward, Sam!’ said Merry; Sam stood face scarlet ears. ‘Here’s collector information! And collected lot, I tell you, finally caught. After which, I may say, seemed regard parole, dried up.’ ‘Sam!’ cried Frodo, feeling amazement could go further, quite unable decide whether felt angry, amused, relieved, merely foolish. ‘Yes, sir!’ said Sam. ‘Begging pardon, sir! But I meant wrong you, Mr. Frodo, Mr. Gandalf matter. He sense, mind you; said go alone, said no! take someone trust.’ ‘But seem I trust anyone,’ said Frodo. Sam looked unhappily. ‘It depends want,’ put Merry. ‘You trust us stick thick thin – bitter end. And trust us keep secret – closer keep yourself. But cannot trust us let face trouble alone, go without word. We friends, Frodo. Anyway: is. We know Gandalf told you. We know good deal Ring. We horribly afraid – coming you; following like hounds.’ ‘And all, sir,’ added Sam, ‘you ought take Elves’ advice. Gildor said take willing, can’t deny it.’ ‘I don’t deny it,’ said Frodo, looking Sam, grinning. ‘I don’t deny it, I’ll never believe sleeping again, whether snore not. I shall kick hard make sure. ‘You set deceitful scoundrels!’ said, turning others. ‘But bless you!’ laughed, getting waving arms, ‘I give in. I take Gildor’s advice. If danger dark, I dance joy. Even so, I cannot help feeling happy; happier I felt long time. I dreaded evening.’ ‘Good! That’s settled. Three cheers Captain Frodo company!’ shouted; danced round him. Merry Pippin began song, apparently got ready occasion. It made model dwarf-song started Bilbo adventure long ago, went tune: Farewell call hearth hall! Though wind may blow rain may fall, We must away ere break day Far wood mountain tall. To Rivendell, Elves yet dwell In glades beneath misty fell, Through moor waste ride haste, And whither cannot tell. With foes ahead, behind us dread, Beneath sky shall bed, Until last toil passed, Our journey done, errand sped. We must away! We must away! We ride break day! ‘Very good!’ said Frodo. ‘But case lot things go bed – roof, tonight rate.’ ‘Oh! That poetry!’ said Pippin. ‘Do really mean start break day?’ ‘I don’t know,’ answered Frodo. ‘I fear Black Riders, I sure unsafe stay one place long, especially place known I going. Also Gildor advised wait. But I much like see Gandalf. I could see even Gildor disturbed heard Gandalf never appeared. It really depends two things. How soon could Riders get Bucklebury? And soon could get off? It take good deal preparation.’ ‘The answer second question,’ said Merry, ‘is could get hour. I prepared practically everything. There five ponies stable across fields; stores tackle packed, except extra clothes, perishable food.’ ‘It seems efficient conspiracy,’ said Frodo. ‘But Black Riders? Would safe wait one day Gandalf?’ ‘That depends think Riders would do, found here,’ answered Merry. ‘They could reached now, course, stopped North-gate, Hedge runs riverbank, side Bridge. The gate-guards would let night, though might break through. Even daylight would try keep out, I think, rate got message Master Hall – would like look Riders, would certainly frightened them. But, course, Buckland cannot resist determined attack long. And possible morning even Black Rider rode asked Mr. Baggins would let through. It pretty generally known coming back live Crickhollow.’ Frodo sat thought. ‘I made mind,’ said finally. ‘I starting tomorrow, soon light. But I going road: would safer wait that. If I go North-gate departure Buckland known once, instead secret several days least, might be. And more, Bridge East Road near borders certainly watched, whether Rider gets Buckland not. We don’t know many are; least two, possibly more. The thing go quite unexpected direction.’ ‘But mean going Old Forest!’ said Fredegar horrified. ‘You can’t thinking that. It quite dangerous Black Riders.’ ‘Not quite,’ said Merry. ‘It sounds desperate, I believe Frodo right. It way getting without followed once. With luck might get considerable start.’ ‘But won’t luck Old Forest,’ objected Fredegar. ‘No one ever luck there. You’ll get lost. People don’t go there.’ ‘Oh yes do!’ said Merry. ‘The Brandybucks go – occasionally fit takes them. We private entrance. Frodo went once, long ago. I several times: usually daylight, course, trees sleepy fairly quiet.’ ‘Well, think best!’ said Fredegar. ‘I afraid Old Forest anything I know about: stories nightmare; vote hardly counts, I going journey. Still, I glad someone stopping behind, tell Gandalf done, turns up, I sure long.’ Fond Frodo, Fatty Bolger desire leave Shire, see lay outside it. His family came Eastfarthing, Budgeford Bridgefields fact, never Brandywine Bridge. His task, according original plans conspirators, stay behind deal inquisitive folk, keep long possible pretence Mr. Baggins still living Crickhollow. He even brought along old clothes Frodo’s help playing part. They little thought dangerous part might prove. ‘Excellent!’ said Frodo, understood plan. ‘We could left message behind Gandalf otherwise. I don’t know whether Riders read not, course, I dared risk written message, case got searched house. But Fatty willing hold fort, I sure Gandalf knowing way gone, decides me. I going Old Forest first thing tomorrow.’ ‘Well, that’s that,’ said Pippin. ‘On whole I would rather job Fatty’s – waiting till Black Riders come.’ ‘You wait till well inside Forest,’ said Fredegar. ‘You’ll wish back time tomorrow.’ ‘It’s good arguing more,’ said Merry. ‘We still got tidy put finishing touches packing, get bed. I shall call break day.’ When last got bed, Frodo could sleep time. His legs ached. He glad riding morning. Eventually fell vague dream, seemed looking high window dark sea tangled trees. Down among roots sound creatures crawling snuffling. He felt sure would smell sooner later. Then heard noise distance. At first thought great wind coming leaves forest. Then knew leaves, sound Sea far-off; sound never heard waking life, though often troubled dreams. Suddenly found open. There trees all. He dark heath, strange salt smell air. Looking saw tall white tower, standing alone high ridge. A great desire came climb tower see Sea. He started struggle ridge towards tower: suddenly light came sky, noise thunder. Chapter 6 THE OLD FOREST Frodo woke suddenly. It still dark room. Merry standing candle one hand, banging door other. ‘All right! What it?’ said Frodo, still shaken bewildered. ‘What it!’ cried Merry. ‘It time get up. It half past fourandveryfoggy.Comeon!Samisalreadygettingbreakfast ready. Even Pippin up. I going saddle ponies, fetch one baggage-carrier. Wake sluggard Fatty! At least must get see us off.’ Soon six o’clock five hobbits ready start. Fatty Bolger still yawning. They stole quietly house. Merry went front leading laden pony, took way along path went spinney behind house, cut across several fields. The leaves trees glistening, every twig dripping; grass grey cold dew. Everything still, far-away noises seemed near clear: fowls chattering yard, someone closing door distant house. In shed found ponies: sturdy little beasts kind loved hobbits, speedy, good long day’s work. They mounted, soon riding mist, seemed open reluctantly close forbiddingly behind them. After riding hour, slowly without talking, saw Hedge looming suddenly ahead. It tall netted silver cobwebs. ‘How going get this?’ asked Fredegar. ‘Follow me!’ said Merry, ‘and see.’ He turned left along Hedge, soon came point bent inwards, running along lip hollow. A cutting made, distance Hedge, went sloping gently ground. It walls brick sides, rose steadily, suddenly arched formed tunnel dived deep Hedge came hollow side. Here Fatty Bolger halted. ‘Good-bye, Frodo!’ said. ‘I wish going Forest. I hope need rescuing day out. But good luck – today every day!’ ‘If worse things ahead Old Forest, I shall lucky,’ said Frodo. ‘Tell Gandalf hurry along East Road: shall soon back going fast can.’ ‘Good-bye!’ cried, rode slope disappeared Fredegar’s sight tunnel. It dark damp. At far end closed gate thick-set iron bars. Merry got unlocked gate, passed pushed again. It shut clang, lock clicked. The sound ominous. ‘There!’ said Merry. ‘You left Shire, outside, edge Old Forest.’ ‘Are stories true?’ asked Pippin. ‘I don’t know stories mean,’ Merry answered. ‘If mean old bogey-stories Fatty’s nurses used tell him, goblins wolves things sort, I say no. At rate I don’t believe them. But Forest queer. Everything much alive, aware going on, speak, things Shire. And trees like strangers. They watch you. They usually content merely watch you, long daylight lasts, don’t much. Occasionally unfriendly ones may drop branch, stick root out, grasp long trailer. But night things alarming, I told. I twice dark, near hedge. I thought trees whispering other, passing news plots along unintelligible language; branches swayed groped without wind. They say trees actually move, surround strangers hem in. In fact long ago attacked Hedge: came planted right it, leaned it. But hobbits came cut hundreds trees, made great bonfire Forest, burned ground long strip east Hedge. After trees gave attack, became unfriendly. There still wide bare space far inside bonfire made.’ ‘Is trees dangerous?’ asked Pippin. ‘There various queer things living deep Forest, far side,’ said Merry, ‘or least I heard so; I never seen them. But something makes paths. Whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks; seem shift change time time queer fashion. Not far tunnel is, long time, beginning quite broad path leading Bonfire Glade, less direction, east little north. That path I going try find.’ The hobbits left tunnel-gate rode across wide hollow. On far side faint path leading floor Forest, hundred yards beyond Hedge; vanished soon brought trees. Looking back could see dark line Hedge stems trees already thick them. Looking ahead could see tree-trunks innumerable sizes shapes: straight bent, twisted, leaning, squat slender, smooth gnarled branched; stems green grey moss slimy, shaggy growths. Merry alone seemed fairly cheerful. ‘You better lead find path,’ Frodo said him. ‘Don’t let us lose one another, forget way Hedge lies!’ They picked way among trees, ponies plodded along, carefully avoiding many writhing interlacing roots. There undergrowth. The ground rising steadily, went forward seemed trees became taller, darker, thicker. There sound, except occasional drip moisture falling still leaves. For moment whispering movement among branches; got uncomfortable feeling watched disapproval, deepening dislike even enmity. The feeling steadily grew, found looking quickly, glancing back shoulders, expected sudden blow. There yet sign path, trees seemed constantly bar way. Pippin suddenly felt could bear longer, without warning let shout. ‘Oi! Oi!’ cried. ‘I going anything. Just let pass through, you!’ The others halted startled; cry fell muffled heavy curtain. There echo answer though wood seemed become crowded watchful before. ‘I shout, I you,’ said Merry. ‘It harm good.’ Frodo began wonder possible find way through, right make others come abominable wood. Merry looking side side, seemed already uncertain way go. Pippin noticed it. ‘It taken long lose us,’ said. But moment Merry gave whistle relief pointed ahead. ‘Well, well!’ said. ‘These trees shift. There Bonfire Glade front us (or I hope so), path seems moved away!’ The light grew clearer went forward. Suddenly came trees found wide circular space. There sky them, blue clear surprise, Forest-roof able see rising morning lifting mist. The sun not, however, high enough yet shine clearing, though light tree-tops. The leaves thicker greener edges glade, enclosing almost solid wall. No tree grew there, rough grass many tall plants: stalky faded hemlocks wood-parsley, fire-weed seeding fluffy ashes, rampant nettles thistles. A dreary place: seemed charming cheerful garden close Forest. The hobbits felt encouraged, looked hopefully broadening daylight sky. At far side glade break wall trees, clear path beyond it. They could see running wood, wide places open above, though every trees drew overshadowed dark boughs. Up path rode. They still climbing gently, went much quicker, better heart; seemed Forest relented, going let pass unhindered all. But air began get hot stuffy. The trees drew close either side, could longer see far ahead. Now stronger ever felt ill wood pressing them. So silent fall ponies’ hoofs, rustling dead leaves occasionally stumbling hidden roots, seemed thud ears. Frodo tried sing song encourage them, voice sank murmur. O! Wanderers shadowed land despair not! For though dark stand, woods must end last, see open sun go past: setting sun, rising sun, day’s end, day begun. For east west woods must fail . . . Fail – even said word voice faded silence. The air seemed heavy making words wearisome. Just behind large branch fell old overhanging tree crash path. The trees seemed close them. ‘They like ending failing,’ said Merry. ‘I sing present. Wait till get edge, we’ll turn give rousing chorus!’ He spoke cheerfully, felt great anxiety, show it. The others answer. They depressed. A heavy weight settling steadily Frodo’s heart, regretted every step forward ever thought challenging menace trees. He was, indeed, stop propose going back (if still possible), things took new turn. The path stopped climbing, became nearly level. The dark trees drew aside, ahead could see path going almost straight forward. Before them, distance off, stood green hill-top, treeless, rising like bald head encircling wood. The path seemed making directly it. They hurried forward again, delighted thought climbing roof Forest. The path dipped, began climb upwards, leading last foot steep hillside. There left trees faded turf. The wood stood round hill like thick hair ended sharply circle round shaven crown. The hobbits led ponies up, winding round round reached top. There stood gazed them. The air gleaming sunlit, hazy; could see great distance. Near hand mist almost gone; though lay hollows wood, south them, deep fold cutting right across Forest, fog still rose like steam wisps white smoke. ‘That,’ said Merry, pointing hand, ‘that line Withywindle. It comes Downs flows south-west midst Forest join Brandywine Haysend. We don’t want go way! The Withywindle valley said queerest part whole wood – centre queerness comes, were.’ The others looked direction Merry pointed out, could see little mists damp deep-cut valley; beyond southern half Forest faded view. The sun hill-top getting hot. It must eleven o’clock; autumn haze still prevented seeing much directions. In west could make either line Hedge valley Brandywine beyond it. Northward, looked hopefully, could see nothing might line great East Road, making. They island sea trees, horizon veiled. On south-eastern side ground fell steeply, slopes hill continued far trees, like island-shores really sides mountain rising deep waters. They sat green edge looked woods them, ate mid-day meal. As sun rose passed noon glimpsed far east grey-green lines Downs lay beyond Old Forest side. That cheered greatly; good see sight anything beyond wood’s borders, though mean go way, could help it: Barrow-downs sinister reputation hobbit-legend Forest itself. Atlengththeymadeuptheir mindstogoonagain.Thepath brought hill reappeared northward side; followed far became aware bending steadily right. Soon began descend rapidly guessed must actually heading towards Withywindle valley: direction wished take. After discussion decided leave misleading path strike northward; although able see hill-top, Road must lie way, could many miles off. Also northward, left path, land seemed drier open, climbing slopes trees thinner, pines firs replaced oaks ashes strange nameless trees denser wood. At first choice seemed good: got along fair speed, though whenever got glimpse sun open glade seemed unaccountably veered eastwards. But time trees began close again, appeared distance thinner less tangled. Then deep folds ground discovered unexpectedly, like ruts great giant-wheels wide moats sunken roads long disused choked brambles. These lay usually right across line march, could crossed scrambling again, troublesome difficult ponies. Each time climbed found hollow filled thick bushes matted undergrowth, somehow would yield left, gave way turned right; go distance along bottom could find way bank. Each time clambered out, trees seemed deeper darker; always left upwards difficult find way, forced right downwards. After hour two lost clear sense direction, though knew well enough long ceased go northward all. They headed off, simply following course chosen – eastwards southwards, heart Forest it. The afternoon wearing away scrambled stumbled fold wider deeper yet met. It steep overhung proved impossible climb again, either forwards backwards, without leaving ponies baggage behind. All could follow fold – downwards. The ground grew soft, places boggy; springs appeared banks, soon found following brook trickled babbled weedy bed. Then ground began fall rapidly, brook growing strong noisy, flowed leaped swiftly downhill. They deep dim-lit gully over-arched trees high them. After stumbling along way along stream, came quite suddenly gloom. As gate saw sunlight them. Coming opening found made way cleft high steep bank, almost cliff. At feet wide space grass reeds; distance could glimpsed another bank almost steep. A golden afternoon late sunshine lay warm drowsy upon hidden land between. In midst wound lazily dark river brown water, bordered ancient willows, arched willows, blocked fallen willows, flecked thousands faded willow-leaves. The air thick them, fluttering yellow branches; warm gentle breeze blowing softly valley, reeds rustling, willow-boughs creaking. ‘Well, I least notion are!’ said Merry. ‘We come almost opposite direction intended. This River Withywindle! I go explore.’ He passed sunshine disappeared long grasses. After reappeared, reported fairly solid ground cliff-foot river; places firm turf went water’s edge. ‘What’s more,’ said, ‘there seems something like footpath winding along side river. If turn left follow it, shall bound come east side Forest eventually.’ ‘I dare say!’ said Pippin. ‘That is, track goes far, simply lead us bog leave us there. Who made track, suppose, why? I sure benefit. I getting suspicious Forest everything it, I begin believe stories it. And idea far eastward go?’ ‘No,’ said Merry, ‘I haven’t. I don’t know least far Withywindle are, could possibly come often enough make path along it. But way I see think of.’ There nothing else it, filed out, Merry led path discovered. Everywhere reeds grasses lush tall, places far heads; found, path easy follow, turned twisted, picking sounder ground among bogs pools. Here passed rills, running gullies Withywindle higher forest-lands, points tree-trunks bundles brushwood laid carefully across. The hobbits began feel hot. There armies flies kinds buzzing round ears, afternoon sun burning backs. At last came suddenly thin shade; great grey branches reached across path. Each step forward became reluctant last. Sleepiness seemed creeping ground legs, falling softly air upon heads eyes. Frodo felt chin go head nod. Just front Pippin fell forward knees. Frodo halted. ‘It’s good,’ heard Merry saying. ‘Can’t go another step without rest. Must nap. It’s cool willows. Less flies!’ Frodo like sound this. ‘Come on!’ cried. ‘We can’t nap yet. We must get clear Forest first.’ But others far gone care. Beside Sam stood yawning blinking stupidly. Suddenly Frodo felt sleep overwhelming him. His head swam. There seemed hardly sound air. The flies stopped buzzing. Only gentle noise edge hearing, soft fluttering song half whispered, seemed stir boughs above. He lifted heavy eyes saw leaning huge willow-tree, old hoary. Enormous looked, sprawling branches going like reaching arms many long-fingered hands, knotted twisted trunk gaping wide fissures creaked faintly boughs moved. The leaves fluttering bright sky dazzled him, toppled over, lying fell upon grass. Merry Pippin dragged forward lay backs willow-trunk. Behind great cracks gaped wide receive tree swayed creaked. They looked grey yellow leaves, moving softly light, singing. They shut eyes, seemed could almost hear words, cool words, saying something water sleep. They gave spell fell fast asleep foot great grey willow. Frodo lay fighting sleep overpowering him; effort struggled feet again. He felt compelling desire cool water. ‘Wait me, Sam,’ stammered. ‘Must bathe feet minute.’ Half dream wandered forward riverward side tree, great winding roots grew stream, like gnarled dragonets straining drink. He straddled one these, paddled hot feet cool brown water; suddenly fell asleep back tree. Sam sat scratched head, yawned like cavern. He worried. The afternoon getting late, thought sudden sleepiness uncanny. ‘There’s behind sun warm air,’ muttered himself. ‘I don’t like great big tree. I don’t trust it. Hark singing sleep now! This won’t all!’ He pulled feet, staggered see become ponies. He found two wandered good way along path; caught brought back towards others, heard two noises; one loud, soft clear. One splash something heavy falling water; noise like snick lock door quietly closes fast. He rushed back bank. Frodo water close edge, great tree-root seemed holding down, struggling. Sam gripped jacket, dragged root; difficulty hauled bank. Almost woke, coughed spluttered. ‘Do know, Sam,’ said length, ‘the beastly tree threw in! I felt it. The big root twisted round tipped in!’ ‘You dreaming I expect, Mr. Frodo,’ said Sam. ‘You shouldn’t sit place, feel sleepy.’ ‘What others?’ Frodo asked. ‘I wonder sort dreams having.’ They went round side tree, Sam understood click heard. Pippin vanished. The crack laid closed together, chink could seen. Merry trapped: another crack closed waist; legs lay outside, rest inside dark opening, edges gripped like pair pincers. Frodo Sam beat first upon tree-trunk Pippin lain. They struggled frantically pull open jaws crack held poor Merry. It quite useless. ‘What foul thing happen!’ cried Frodo wildly. ‘Why ever come dreadful Forest? I wish back Crickhollow!’ He kicked tree strength, heedless feet. A hardly perceptible shiver ran stem branches; leaves rustled whispered, sound faint far-off laughter. ‘I suppose haven’t got axe among luggage, Mr. Frodo?’ asked Sam. ‘I brought little hatchet chopping firewood,’ said Frodo. ‘That wouldn’t much use.’ ‘Wait minute!’ cried Sam, struck idea suggested firewood. ‘We might something fire!’ ‘We might,’ said Frodo doubtfully. ‘We might succeed roasting Pippin alive inside.’ ‘We might try hurt frighten tree begin with,’ said Sam fiercely. ‘If don’t let go, I’ll down, I gnaw it.’ He ran ponies long came back two tinder-boxes hatchet. Quickly gathered dry grass leaves, bits bark; made pile broken twigs chopped sticks. These heaped trunk far side tree prisoners. As soon Sam struck spark tinder, kindled dry grass flurry flame smoke went up. The twigs crackled. Little fingers fire licked dry scored rind ancient tree scorched it. A tremor ran whole willow. The leaves seemed hiss heads sound pain anger. A loud scream came Merry, far inside tree heard Pippin give muffled yell. ‘Put out! Put out!’ cried Merry. ‘He’ll squeeze two, don’t. He says so!’ ‘Who? What?’ shouted Frodo, rushing round side tree. ‘Put out! Put out!’ begged Merry. The branches willow began sway violently. There sound wind rising spreading outwards branches trees round about, though dropped stone quiet slumber river-valley set ripples anger ran whole Forest. Sam kicked little fire stamped sparks. But Frodo, without clear idea so, hoped for, ran along path crying help! help! help! It seemed could hardly hear sound shrill voice: blown away willow-wind drowned clamour leaves, soon words left mouth. He felt desperate: lost witless. Suddenly stopped. There answer, thought; seemed come behind him, away path back Forest. He turned round listened, soon could doubt: someone singing song; deep glad voice singing carelessly happily, singing nonsense: Hey dol! merry dol! ring dong dillo! Ring dong! hop along! fal lal willow! Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo! Half hopeful half afraid new danger, Frodo Sam stood still. Suddenly long string nonsense-words (or seemed) voice rose loud clear burst song: Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My darling! Light goes weather-wind feathered starling. Down along Hill, shining sunlight, Waiting doorstep cold starlight, There pretty lady is, River-woman’s daughter, Slender willow-wand, clearer water. Old Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing Comes hopping home again. Can hear singing? Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! merry-o, Goldberry, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o! Poor old Willow-man, tuck roots away! Tom’s hurry now. Evening follow day. Tom’s going home water-lilies bringing. Hey! Come derry dol! Can hear singing? Frodo Sam stood enchanted. The wind puffed out. The leaves hung silently stiff branches. There another burst song, suddenly, hopping dancing along path, appeared reeds old battered hat tall crown long blue feather stuck band. With another hop bound came view man, seemed. At rate large heavy hobbit, quite tall enough one Big People, though made noise enough one, stumping along great yellow boots thick legs, charging grass rushes like cow going drink. He blue coat long brown beard; eyes blue bright, face red ripe apple, creased hundred wrinkles laughter. In hands carried large leaf tray small pile white water-lilies. ‘Help!’ cried Frodo Sam running towards hands stretched out. ‘Whoa! Whoa! steady there!’ cried old man, holding one hand, stopped short, struck stiff. ‘Now, little fellows, a-going to, puffing like bellows? What’s matter then? Do know I am? I’m Tom Bombadil. Tell what’s trouble! Tom’s hurry now. Don’t crush lilies!’ ‘My friends caught willow-tree,’ cried Frodo breathlessly. ‘Master Merry’s squeezed crack!’ cried Sam. ‘What?’ shouted Tom Bombadil, leaping air. ‘Old Man Willow? Naught worse that, eh? That soon mended. I know tune him. Old grey Willow-man! I’ll freeze marrow cold, don’t behave himself. I’ll sing roots off. I’ll sing wind blow leaf branch away. Old Man Willow!’ Setting lilies carefully grass, ran tree. There saw Merry’s feet still sticking – rest already drawn inside. Tom put mouth crack began singing low voice. They could catch words, evidently Merry aroused. His legs began kick. Tom sprang away, breaking hanging branch smote side willow it. ‘You let again, Old Man Willow!’ said. ‘What a-thinking of? You waking. Eat earth! Dig deep! Drink water! Go sleep! Bombadil talking!’ He seized Merry’s feet drew suddenly widening crack. There tearing creak crack split open, Pippin sprang, kicked. Then loud snap cracks closed fast again. A shudder ran tree root tip, complete silence fell. ‘Thank you!’ said hobbits, one other. Tom Bombadil burst laughing. ‘Well, little fellows!’ said he, stooping peered faces. ‘You shall come home me! The table laden yellow cream, honeycomb, white bread butter. Goldberry waiting. Time enough questions around supper table. You follow quick able!’ With picked lilies, beckoning wave hand went hopping dancing along path eastward, still singing loudly nonsensically. Too surprised relieved talk, hobbits followed fast could. But fast enough. Tom soon disappeared front them, noise singing got fainter away. Suddenly voice came floating back loud halloo! Hop along, little friends, Withywindle! Tom’s going ahead candles kindle. Down west sinks Sun: soon groping. When night-shadows fall, door open, Out window-panes light twinkle yellow. Fear alder black! Heed hoary willow! Fear neither root bough! Tom goes you. Hey now! merry dol! We’ll waiting you! After hobbits heard more. Almost sun seemed sink trees behind them. They thought slanting light evening glittering Brandywine River, windows Bucklebury beginning gleam hundreds lights. Great shadows fell across them; trunks branches trees hung dark threatening path. White mists began rise curl surface river stray roots trees upon borders. Out ground feet shadowy steam arose mingled swiftly falling dusk. It became difficult follow path, tired. Their legs seemed leaden. Strange furtive noises ran among bushes reeds either side them; looked pale sky, caught sight queer gnarled knobbly faces gloomed dark twilight, leered high bank edges wood. They began feel country unreal, stumbling ominous dream led awakening. Just felt feet slowing standstill, noticed ground gently rising. The water began murmur. In darkness caught white glimmer foam, river flowed short fall. Then suddenly trees came end mists left behind. They stepped Forest, found wide sweep grass welling them. The river, small swift, leaping merrily meet them, glinting light stars, already shining sky. The grass feet smooth short, mown shaven. The eaves Forest behind clipped, trim hedge. The path plain them, well-tended bordered stone. It wound top grassy knoll, grey pale starry night; there, still high slope, saw twinkling lights house. Down path went, again, long smooth hillside turf, towards light. Suddenly wide yellow beam flowed brightly door opened. There Tom Bombadil’s house them, up, down, hill. Behind steep shoulder land lay grey bare, beyond dark shapes Barrow-downs stalked away eastern night. They hurried forward, hobbits ponies. Already half weariness fears fallen them. Hey! Come merry dol! rolled song greet them. Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, hearties! Hobbits! Ponies all! We fond parties. Now let fun begin! Let us sing together! Then another clear voice, young ancient Spring, like song glad water flowing night bright morning hills, came falling like silver meet them: Now let song begin! Let us sing together Of sun, stars, moon mist, rain cloudy weather, Light budding leaf, dew feather, Wind open hill, bells heather, Reeds shady pool, lilies water: Old Tom Bombadil River-daughter! And song hobbits stood upon threshold, golden light them. Chapter 7 IN THE HOUSE OF TOM BOMBADIL The four hobbits stepped wide stone threshold, stood still, blinking. They long low room, filled light lamps swinging beams roof; table dark polished wood stood many candles, tall yellow, burning brightly. In chair, far side room facing outer door, sat woman. Her long yellow hair rippled shoulders; gown green, green young reeds, shot silver like beads dew; belt gold, shaped like chain flag-lilies set pale-blue eyes forgetme-nots. About feet wide vessels green brown earthenware, white water-lilies floating, seemed enthroned midst pool. ‘Enter, good guests!’ said, spoke knew clear voice heard singing. They came timid steps room, began bow low, feeling strangely surprised awkward, like folk that, knocking cottage door beg drink water, answered fair young elf-queen clad living flowers. But could say anything, sprang lightly lily-bowls, ran laughing towards them; ran gown rustled softly like wind flowering borders river. ‘Comedearfolk!’shesaid,takingFrodobythehand.‘Laugh merry! I Goldberry, daughter River.’ Then lightly passed closing door turned back it, white arms spread across it. ‘Let us shut outthenight!’shesaid.‘Foryouarestillafraid,perhaps,ofmist tree-shadows deep water, untame things. Fear nothing!FortonightyouareundertheroofofTomBombadil.’ The hobbits looked wonder; looked smiled. ‘Fair lady Goldberry!’ said Frodo last, feeling heart moved joy understand. He stood times stood enchanted fair elven-voices; spell laid upon different: less keen lofty delight, deeper nearer mortal heart; marvellous yet strange. ‘Fair lady Goldberry!’ said again. ‘Now joy hidden songs heard made plain me. O slender willow-wand! O clearer clear water! O reed living pool! Fair River-daughter! O spring-time summer-time, spring after! O wind waterfall, leaves’ laughter!’ Suddenly stopped stammered, overcome surprise hear saying things. But Goldberry laughed. ‘Welcome!’ said. ‘I heard folk Shire sweet-tongued. But I see Elf-friend; light eyes ring voice tells it. This merry meeting! Sit now, wait Master house! He long. He tending tired beasts.’ The hobbits sat gladly low rush-seated chairs, Goldberry busied table; eyes followed her, slender grace movement filled quiet delight. From somewhere behind house came sound singing. Every caught, among many derry dol merry dol ring ding dillo repeated words: Old Tom Bombadil merry fellow; Bright blue jacket is, boots yellow. ‘Fair lady!’ said Frodo while. ‘Tell me, asking seem foolish, Tom Bombadil?’ ‘He is,’ said Goldberry, staying swift movements smiling. Frodo looked questioningly. ‘He is, seen him,’ said answer look. ‘He Master wood, water, hill.’ ‘Then strange land belongs him?’ ‘No indeed!’ answered, smile faded. ‘That would indeed burden,’ added low voice, herself. ‘The trees grasses things growing living land belong themselves. Tom Bombadil Master. No one ever caught old Tom walking forest, wading water, leaping hill-tops light shadow. He fear. Tom Bombadil master.’ A door opened came Tom Bombadil. He hat thick brown hair crowned autumn leaves. He laughed, going Goldberry, took hand. ‘Here’s pretty lady!’ said, bowing hobbits. ‘Here’s Goldberry clothed silver-green flowers girdle! Is table laden? I see yellow cream honeycomb, white bread, butter; milk, cheese, green herbs ripe berries gathered. Is enough us? Is supper ready?’ ‘It is,’ said Goldberry; ‘but guests perhaps not?’ Tom clapped hands cried: ‘Tom, Tom! guests tired, near forgotten! Come now, merry friends, Tom refresh you! You shall clean grimy hands, wash weary faces; cast muddy cloaks comb tangles!’ He opened door, followed short passage round sharp turn. They came low room sloping roof (a penthouse, seemed, built north end house). Its walls clean stone, mostly covered green hanging mats yellow curtains. The floor flagged, strewn fresh green rushes. There four deep mattresses, piled white blankets, laid floor along one side. Against opposite wall long bench laden wide earthenware basins, beside stood brown ewers filled water, cold, steaming hot. There soft green slippers set ready beside bed. Before long, washed refreshed, hobbits seated table, two side, either end sat Goldberry Master. It long merry meal. Though hobbits ate, famished hobbits eat, lack. The drink drinking-bowls seemed clear cold water, yet went hearts like wine set free voices. The guests became suddenly aware singing merrily, easier natural talking. At last Tom Goldberry rose cleared table swiftly. The guests commanded sit quiet, set chairs, footstool tired feet. There fire wide hearth them, burning sweet smell, built apple-wood. When everything set order, lights room put out, except one lamp pair candles end chimney-shelf. Then Goldberry came stood them, holding candle; wished good night deep sleep. ‘Have peace now,’ said, ‘until morning! Heed nightly noises! For nothing passes door window save moonlight starlight wind hill-top. Good night!’ She passed room glimmer rustle. The sound footsteps like stream falling gently away downhill cool stones quiet night. Tom sat beside silence, tried muster courage ask one many questions meant ask supper. Sleep gathered eyelids. At last Frodo spoke: ‘Did hear calling, Master, chance brought moment?’ Tom stirred like man shaken pleasant dream. ‘Eh, what?’ said he. ‘Did I hear calling? Nay, I hear: I busy singing. Just chance brought then, chance call it. It plan mine, though I waiting you. We heard news you, learned wandering. We guessed you’d come ere long water: paths lead way, Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he’s mighty singer; it’s hard little folk escape cunning mazes. But Tom errand there, dared hinder.’ Tom nodded sleep taking again; went soft singing voice: I errand there: gathering water-lilies, green leaves lilies white please pretty lady, last ere year’s end keep winter, flower pretty feet till snows melted. Each year summer’s end I go find her, wide pool, deep clear, far Withywindle; open first spring linger latest. By pool long ago I found River-daughter, fair young Goldberry sitting rushes. Sweet singing then, heart beating! He opened eyes looked sudden glint blue: And proved well – I shall longer go deep along forest-water, year old. Nor shall I passing Old Man Willow’s house side spring-time, till merry spring, River-daughter dances withy-path bathe water. He fell silent again; Frodo could help asking one question: one desired answered. ‘Tell us, Master,’ said, ‘about Willow-man. What he? I never heard before.’ ‘No, don’t!’ said Merry Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright. ‘Not now! Not morning!’ ‘That right!’ said old man. ‘Now time resting. Some things ill hear world’s shadow. Sleep till morning-light, rest pillow! Heed nightly noise! Fear grey willow!’ And took lamp blew out, grasping candle either hand led room. Their mattresses pillows soft down, blankets white wool. They hardly laid deep beds drawn light covers asleep. In dead night, Frodo lay dream without light. Then saw young moon rising; thin light loomed black wall rock, pierced dark arch like great gate. It seemed Frodo lifted up, passing saw rock-wall circle hills, within plain, midst plain stood pinnacle stone, like vast tower made hands. On top stood figure man. The moon rose seemed hang moment head glistened white hair wind stirred it. Up dark plain came crying fell voices, howling many wolves. Suddenly shadow, like shape great wings, passed across moon. The figure lifted arms light flashed staff wielded. A mighty eagle swept bore away. The voices wailed wolves yammered. There noise like strong wind blowing, borne sound hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping East. ‘Black Riders!’ thought Frodo wakened, sound hoofs still echoing mind. He wondered would ever courage leave safety stone walls. He lay motionless, still listening; silent, last turned fell asleep wandered unremembered dream. At side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; change came dreams turned groaned. Suddenly woke, thought waked, yet still heard darkness sound disturbed dream: tip-tap, squeak: noise like branches fretting wind, twig-fingers scraping wall window: creak, creak, creak. He wondered willow-trees close house; suddenly dreadful feeling ordinary house all, inside willow listening horrible dry creaking voice laughing again. He sat up, felt soft pillows yield hands, lay relieved. He seemed hear echo words ears: ‘Fear nothing! Have peace morning! Heed nightly noises!’ Then went sleep again. It sound water Merry heard falling quiet sleep: water streaming gently, spreading, spreading irresistibly round house dark shoreless pool. It gurgled walls, rising slowly surely. ‘I shall drowned!’ thought. ‘It find way in, I shall drown.’ He felt lying soft slimy bog, springing set foot corner cold hard flagstone. Then remembered lay again. He seemed hear remember hearing: ‘Nothing passes doors windows save moonlight starlight wind hill-top.’ A little breath sweet air moved curtain. He breathed deep fell asleep again. As far could remember, Sam slept night deep content, logs contented. They woke up, four once, morning light. Tom moving room whistling like starling. When heard stir clapped hands, cried: ‘Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My hearties!’ He drew back yellow curtains, hobbits saw covered windows, either end room, one looking east looking west. They leapt refreshed. Frodo ran eastern window, found looking kitchen-garden grey dew. He half expected see turf right walls, turf pocked hoof-prints. Actually view screened tall line beans poles; far beyond grey top hill loomed sunrise. It pale morning: East, behind long clouds like lines soiled wool stained red edges, lay glimmering deeps yellow. The sky spoke rain come; light broadening quickly, red flowers beans began glow wet green leaves. Pippin looked western window, pool mist. The Forest hidden fog. It like looking sloping cloud-roof above. There fold channel mist broken many plumes billows: valley Withywindle. The stream ran hill left vanished white shadows. Near hand flower-garden clipped hedge silver-netted, beyond grey shaven grass pale dew-drops. There willow-tree seen. ‘Good morning, merry friends!’ cried Tom, opening eastern window wide. A cool air flowed in; rainy smell. ‘Sun won’t show face much today, I’m thinking. I walking wide, leaping hill-tops, since grey dawn began, nosing wind weather, wet grass underfoot, wet sky me. I wakened Goldberry singing window; naught wakes hobbit-folk early morning. In night little folk wake darkness, sleep light come! Ring ding dillo! Wake now, merry friends! Forget nightly noises! Ring ding dillo del! derry del, hearties! If come soon you’ll find breakfast table. If come late you’ll get grass rain-water!’ Needless say – Tom’s threat sounded serious – hobbits came soon, left table late beginning look rather empty. Neither Tom Goldberry there. Tom could heard house, clattering kitchen, stairs, singing outside. The room looked westward mist-clouded valley, window open. Water dripped thatched eaves above. Before finished breakfast clouds joined unbroken roof, straight grey rain came softly steadily down. Behind deep curtain Forest completely veiled. As looked window came falling gently flowing rain sky, clear voice Goldberry singing them. They could hear words, seemed plain song rain-song, sweet showers dry hills, told tale river spring highlands Sea far below. The hobbits listened delight; Frodo glad heart, blessed kindly weather, delayed departing. The thought going heavy upon moment awoke; guessed would go day. The upper wind settled West deeper wetter clouds rolled spill laden rain bare heads Downs. Nothing could seen round house falling water. Frodo stood near open door watched white chalky path turn little river milk go bubbling away valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round corner house, waving arms warding rain – indeed sprang threshold seemed quite dry, except boots. These took put chimney-corner. Then sat largest chair called hobbits gather round him. ‘This Goldberry’s washing day,’ said, ‘and autumn-cleaning. Too wet hobbit-folk – let rest able! It’s good day long tales, questions answers, Tom start talking.’ He told many remarkable stories, sometimes half speaking himself, sometimes looking suddenly bright blue eye deep brows. Often voice would turn song, would get chair dance about. He told tales bees flowers, ways trees, strange creatures Forest, evil things good things, things friendly things unfriendly, cruel things kind things, secrets hidden brambles. As listened, began understand lives Forest, apart themselves, indeed feel strangers things home. Moving constantly talk Old Man Willow, Frodo learned enough content him, indeed enough, comfortable lore. Tom’s words laid bare hearts trees thoughts, often dark strange, filled hatred things go free upon earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers usurpers. It called Old Forest without reason, indeed ancient, survivor vast forgotten woods; lived yet, ageing quicker hills, fathers fathers trees, remembering times lords. The countless years filled pride rooted wisdom, malice. But none dangerous Great Willow: heart rotten, strength green; cunning, master winds, song thought ran woods sides river. His grey thirsty spirit drew power earth spread like fine root-threads ground, invisible twig-fingers air, till dominion nearly trees Forest Hedge Downs. Suddenly Tom’s talk left woods went leaping young stream, bubbling waterfalls, pebbles worn rocks, among small flowers close grass wet crannies, wandering last Downs. They heard Great Barrows, green mounds, stonerings upon hills hollows among hills. Sheep bleating flocks. Green walls white walls rose. There fortresses heights. Kings little kingdoms fought together, young Sun shone like fire red metal new greedy swords. There victory defeat; towers fell, fortresses burned, flames went sky. Gold piled biers dead kings queens; mounds covered them, stone doors shut; grass grew all. Sheep walked biting grass, soon hills empty again. A shadow came dark places far away, bones stirred mounds. Barrow-wights walked hollow places clink rings cold fingers, gold chains wind. Stone rings grinned ground like broken teeth moonlight. The hobbits shuddered. Even Shire rumour Barrow-wights Barrow-downs beyond Forest heard. But tale hobbit liked listen to, even comfortable fireside far away. These four suddenly remembered joy house driven minds: house Tom Bombadil nestled shoulder dreaded hills. They lost thread tale shifted uneasily, looking aside one another. When caught words found wandered strange regions beyond memory beyond waking thought, times world wider, seas flowed straight western Shore; still back Tom went singing ancient starlight, Elf-sires awake. Then suddenly stopped, saw nodded falling asleep. The hobbits sat still him, enchanted; seemed if, spell words, wind gone, clouds dried up, day withdrawn, darkness come East West, sky filled light white stars. Whether morning evening one day many days passed Frodo could tell. He feel either hungry tired, filled wonder. The stars shone window silence heavens seemed round him. He spoke last wonder sudden fear silence: ‘Who you, Master?’ asked. ‘Eh, what?’ said Tom sitting up, eyes glinting gloom. ‘Don’t know name yet? That’s answer. Tell me, you, alone, nameless? But young I old. Eldest, that’s I am. Mark words, friends: Tom river trees; Tom remembers first raindrop first acorn. He made paths Big People, saw little People arriving. He Kings graves Barrow-wights. When Elves passed westward, Tom already, seas bent. He knew dark stars fearless – Dark Lord came Outside.’ A shadow seemed pass window, hobbits glanced hastily panes. When turned again, Goldberry stood door behind, framed light. She held candle, shielding flame draught hand; light flowed it, like sunlight white shell. ‘The rain ended,’ said; ‘and new waters running downhill, stars. Let us laugh glad!’ ‘And let us food drink!’ cried Tom. ‘Long tales thirsty. And long listening’s hungry work, morning, noon, evening!’ With jumped chair, bound took candle chimney-shelf lit flame Goldberry held; danced table. Suddenly hopped door disappeared. Quickly returned, bearing large laden tray. Then Tom Goldberry set table; hobbits sat half wonder half laughter: fair grace Goldberry merry odd caperings Tom. Yet fashion seemed weave single dance, neither hindering other, room, round table; great speed food vessels lights set order. The boards blazed candles, white yellow. Tom bowed guests. ‘Supper ready,’ said Goldberry; hobbits saw clothed silver white girdle, shoes like fishes’ mail. But Tom clean blue, blue rain-washed forget-me-nots, green stockings. It supper even better before. The hobbits spell Tom’s words may missed one meal many, food seemed least week since eaten. They sing even speak much while, paid close attention business. But time hearts spirits rose high again, voices rang mirth laughter. After eaten, Goldberry sang many songs them, songs began merrily hills fell softly silence; silences saw minds pools waters wider known, looking saw sky stars like jewels depths. Then wished good night left fireside. But Tom seemed wide awake plied questions. He appeared already know much families, indeed know much history doings Shire days hardly remembered among hobbits themselves. It longer surprised them; made secret owed recent knowledge largely Farmer Maggot, seemed regard person importance imagined. ‘There’s earth old feet, clay fingers; wisdom bones, eyes open,’ said Tom. It also clear Tom dealings Elves, seemed fashion, news reached Gildor concerning flight Frodo. Indeed much Tom know, cunning questioning, Frodo found telling Bilbo hopes fears told even Gandalf. Tom wagged head down, glint eyes heard Riders. ‘Show precious Ring!’ said suddenly midst story: Frodo, astonishment, drew chain pocket, unfastening Ring handed Tom. It seemed grow larger lay moment big brown-skinned hand. Then suddenly put eye laughed. For second hobbits vision, comical alarming, bright blue eye gleaming circle gold. Then Tom put Ring round end little finger held candlelight. For moment hobbits noticed nothing strange this. Then gasped. There sign Tom disappearing! Tom laughed again, spun Ring air – vanished flash. Frodo gave cry – Tom leaned forward handed back smile. Frodo looked closely, rather suspiciously (like one lent trinket juggler). It Ring, looked weighed same: Ring always seemed Frodo weigh strangely heavy hand. But something prompted make sure. He perhaps trifle annoyed Tom seeming make light even Gandalf thought perilously important. He waited opportunity, talk going again, Tom telling absurd story badgers queer ways – slipped Ring on. Merry turned towards say something gave start, checked exclamation. Frodo delighted (in way): ring right, Merry staring blankly chair, obviously could see him. He got crept quietly away fireside towards outer door. ‘Hey there!’ cried Tom, glancing towards seeing look shining eyes. ‘Hey! Come Frodo, there! Where a-going? Old Tom Bombadil’s blind yet. Take golden ring! Your hand’s fair without it. Come back! Leave game sit beside me! We must talk more, think morning. Tom must teach right road, keep feet wandering.’ Frodo laughed (trying feel pleased), taking Ring came sat again. Tom told reckoned Sun would shine tomorrow, would glad morning, setting would hopeful. But would well start early; weather country thing even Tom could sure long, would change sometimes quicker could change jacket. ‘I weather-master,’ said he; ‘nor aught goes two legs.’ By advice decided make nearly due North house, western lower slopes Downs: might hope way strike East Road day’s journey, avoid Barrows. He told afraid – mind business. ‘Keep green grass. Don’t go a-meddling old stone cold Wights prying houses, unless strong folk hearts never falter!’ He said once; advised pass barrows west-side, chanced stray near one. Then taught rhyme sing, ill-luck fall danger difficulty next day. Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! By water, wood hill, reed willow, By fire, sun moon, harken hear us! Come, Tom Bombadil, need near us! When sung altogether him, clapped shoulder laugh, taking candles led back bedroom. Chapter 8 FOG ON THE BARROW-DOWNS That night heard noises. But either dreams them, could tell which, Frodo heard sweet singing running mind: song seemed come like pale light behind grey rain-curtain, growing stronger turn veil glass silver, last rolled back, far green country opened swift sunrise. The vision melted waking; Tom whistling like tree-full birds; sun already slanting hill open window. Outside everything green pale gold. After breakfast, ate alone, made ready say farewell, nearly heavy heart possible morning: cool, bright, clean washed autumn sky thin blue. The air came fresh Northwest. Their quiet ponies almost frisky, sniffing moving restlessly. Tom came house waved hat danced upon doorstep, bidding hobbits get go good speed. They rode along path wound away behind house, went slanting towards north end hill-brow sheltered. They dismounted lead ponies last steep slope, suddenly Frodo stopped. ‘Goldberry!’ cried. ‘My fair lady, clad silver green! We never said farewell her, seen since evening!’ He distressed turned back; moment clear call came rippling down. There hill-brow stood beckoning them: hair flying loose, caught sun shone shimmered. A light like glint water dewy grass flashed feet danced. They hastened last slope, stood breathless beside her. They bowed, wave arm bade look round; looked hill-top lands morning. It clear far-seen veiled misty stood upon knoll Forest, could seen rising pale green dark trees West. In direction land rose wooded ridges, green, yellow, russet sun, beyond lay hidden valley Brandywine. To South, line Withywindle, distant glint like pale glass Brandywine River made great loop lowlands flowed away knowledge hobbits. Northward beyond dwindling downs land ran away flats swellings grey green pale earth-colours, faded featureless shadowy distance. Eastward Barrow-downs rose, ridge behind ridge morning, vanished eyesight guess: guess blue remote white glimmer blending hem sky, spoke them, memory old tales, high distant mountains. They took deep draught air, felt skip stout strides would bear wherever wished. It seemed fainthearted go jogging aside crumpled skirts downs towards Road, leaping, lusty Tom, stepping stones hills straight towards Mountains. Goldberry spoke recalled eyes thoughts. ‘Speed now, fair guests!’ said. ‘And hold purpose! North wind left eye blessing footsteps! Make haste Sun shines!’ And Frodo said: ‘Farewell, Elf-friend, merry meeting!’ But Frodo found words answer. He bowed low, mounted pony, followed friends jogged slowly gentle slope behind hill. Tom Bombadil’s house valley, Forest lost view. The air grew warmer green walls hillside hillside, scent turf rose strong sweet breathed. Turning back, reached bottom green hollow, saw Goldberry, small slender like sunlit flower sky: standing still watching them, hands stretched towards them. As looked gave clear call, lifting hand turned vanished behind hill. Their way wound along floor hollow, round green feet steep hill another deeper broader valley, shoulders hills, long limbs, smooth sides again, new hill-tops new valleys. There tree visible water: country grass short springy turf, silent except whisper air edges land, high lonely cries strange birds. As journeyed sun mounted, grew hot. Each time climbed ridge breeze seemed grown less. When caught glimpse country westward distant Forest seemed smoking, fallen rain steaming leaf root mould. A shadow lay round edge sight, dark haze upper sky like blue cap, hot heavy. About mid-day came hill whose top wide flattened, like shallow saucer green mounded rim. Inside air stirring, sky seemed near heads. They rode across looked northwards. Then hearts rose; seemed plain come already expected. Certainly distances become hazy deceptive, could doubt Downs coming end. A long valley lay winding away northwards, came opening two steep shoulders. Beyond, seemed hills. Due north faintly glimpsed long dark line. ‘That line trees,’ said Merry, ‘and must mark Road. All along many leagues east Bridge trees growing. Some say planted old days.’ ‘Splendid!’ said Frodo. ‘If make good going afternoon done morning, shall left Downs Sun sets jogging search camping place.’ But even spoke turned glance eastwards, saw side hills higher looked upon them; hills crowned green mounds, standing stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth green gums. That view somehow disquieting; turned sight went hollow circle. In midst stood single stone, standing tall sun above, hour casting shadow. It shapeless yet significant: like landmark, guarding finger, like warning. But hungry, sun still fearless noon; set backs east side stone. It cool, sun power warm it; time seemed pleasant. There took food drink, made good noonmeal open sky anyone could wish; food came ‘down Hill’. Tom provided plenty comfort day. Their ponies unburdened strayed upon grass. Riding hills, eating fill, warm sun scent turf, lying little long, stretching legs looking sky noses: things are, perhaps, enough explain happened. However may be: woke suddenly uncomfortably sleep never meant take. The standing stone cold, cast long pale shadow stretched eastward them. The sun, pale watery yellow, gleaming mist west wall hollow lay; north, south, east, beyond wall fog thick, cold white. The air silent, heavy chill. Their ponies standing crowded together heads down. The hobbits sprang feet alarm, ran western rim. They found upon island fog. Even looked dismay towards setting sun, sank eyes white sea, cold grey shadow sprang East behind. The fog rolled walls rose them, mounted bent heads became roof: shut hall mist whose central pillar standing stone. They felt trap closing them; quite lose heart. They still remembered hopeful view line Road ahead, still knew direction lay. In case, great dislike hollow place stone thought remaining minds. They packed quickly chilled fingers would work. Soon leading ponies single file rim long northward slope hill, foggy sea. As went mist became colder damper, hair hung lank dripping foreheads. When reached bottom chill halted got cloaks hoods, soon became bedewed grey drops. Then, mounting ponies, went slowly again, feeling way rise fall ground. They steering, well could guess, gate-like opening far northward end long valley seen morning. Once gap, keep anything like straight line bound end strike Road. Their thoughts go beyond that, except vague hope perhaps away beyond Downs might fog. Their going slow. To prevent getting separated wandering different directions went file, Frodo leading. Sam behind him, came Pippin, Merry. The valley seemed stretch endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw hopeful sign. On either side ahead darkness began loom mist; guessed last approaching gap hills, north-gate Barrow-downs. If could pass that, would free. ‘Come on! Follow me!’ called back shoulder, hurried forward. But hope soon changed bewilderment alarm. The dark patches grew darker, shrank; suddenly saw, towering ominous leaning slightly towards one another like pillars headless door, two huge standing stones. He could remember seen sign valley, looked hill morning. He passed almost aware: even darkness seemed fall round him. His pony reared snorted, fell off. When looked back found alone: others followed him. ‘Sam!’ called. ‘Pippin! Merry! Come along! Why don’t keep up?’ There answer. Fear took him, ran back past stones shouting wildly: ‘Sam! Sam! Merry! Pippin!’ The pony bolted mist vanished. From way off, seemed, thought heard cry: ‘Hoy! Frodo! Hoy!’ It away eastward, left stood great stones, staring straining gloom. He plunged direction call, found going steeply uphill. As struggled called again, kept calling frantically; heard answer time, seemed faint far ahead high him. ‘Frodo! Hoy!’ came thin voices mist: cry sounded like help, help! often repeated, ending last help! trailed long wail suddenly cut short. He stumbled forward speed could towards cries; light gone, clinging night closed him, impossible sure direction. He seemed time climbing up. Only change level ground feet told last came top ridge hill. He weary, sweating yet chilled. It wholly dark. ‘Where you?’ cried miserably. There reply. He stood listening. He suddenly aware getting cold, wind beginning blow, icy wind. A change coming weather. The mist flowing past shreds tatters. His breath smoking, darkness less near thick. He looked saw surprise faint stars appearing overhead amid strands hurrying cloud fog. The wind began hiss grass. He imagined suddenly caught muffled cry, made towards it; even went forward mist rolled thrust aside, starry sky unveiled. A glance showed facing southwards round hill-top, must climbed north. Out east biting wind blowing. To right loomed westward stars dark black shape. A great barrow stood there. ‘Where you?’ cried again, angry afraid. ‘Here!’ said voice, deep cold, seemed come ground. ‘I waiting you!’ ‘No!’ said Frodo; run away. His knees gave, fell ground. Nothing happened, sound. Trembling looked up, time see tall dark figure like shadow stars. It leaned him. He thought two eyes, cold though lit pale light seemed come remote distance. Then grip stronger colder iron seized him. The icy touch froze bones, remembered more. * * * When came again, moment could recall nothing except sense dread. Then suddenly knew imprisoned, caught hopelessly; barrow. A Barrow-wight taken him, probably already dreadful spells Barrow-wights whispered tales spoke. He dared move, lay found himself: flat back upon cold stone hands breast. But though fear great seemed part darkness round him, found lay thinking Bilbo Baggins stories, jogging along together lanes Shire talking roads adventures. There seed courage hidden (often deeply, true) heart fattest timid hobbit, waiting final desperate danger make grow. Frodo neither fat timid; indeed, though know it, Bilbo (and Gandalf) thought best hobbit Shire. He thought come end adventure, terrible end, thought hardened him. He found stiffening, final spring; longer felt limp like helpless prey. As lay there, thinking getting hold himself, noticed darkness slowly giving way: pale greenish light growing round him. It first show kind place in, light seemed coming himself, floor beside him, yet reached roof wall. He turned, cold glow saw lying beside Sam, Pippin, Merry. They backs, faces looked deathly pale; clad white. About lay many treasures, gold maybe, though light looked cold unlovely. On heads circlets, gold chains waists, fingers many rings. Swords lay sides, shields feet. But across three necks lay one long naked sword. * * * Suddenly song began: cold murmur, rising falling. The voice seemed far away immeasurably dreary, sometimes high air thin, sometimes like low moan ground. Out formless stream sad horrible sounds, strings words would shape themselves: grim, hard, cold words, heartless miserable. The night railing morning bereaved, cold cursing warmth hungered. Frodo chilled marrow. After song became clearer, dread heart perceived changed incantation: Cold hand heart bone, cold sleep stone: never wake stony bed, never, till Sun fails Moon dead. In black wind stars shall die, still gold let lie, till dark lord lifts hand dead sea withered land. He heard behind head creaking scraping sound. Raising one arm looked, saw pale light kind passage behind turned corner. Round corner long arm groping, walking fingers towards Sam, lying nearest, towards hilt sword lay upon him. At first Frodo felt indeed turned stone incantation. Then wild thought escape came him. He wondered put Ring, whether Barrow-wight would miss him, might find way out. He thought running free grass, grieving Merry, Sam, Pippin, free alive himself. Gandalf would admit nothing else could do. But courage awakened strong: could leave friends easily. He wavered, groping pocket, fought again; arm crept nearer. Suddenly resolve hardened him, seized short sword lay beside him, kneeling stooped low bodies companions. With strength hewed crawling arm near wrist, hand broke off; moment sword splintered hilt. There shriek light vanished. In dark snarling noise. Frodo fell forward Merry, Merry’s face felt cold. All back mind, disappeared first coming fog, came memory house Hill, Tom singing. He remembered rhyme Tom taught them. In small desperate voice began: Ho! Tom Bombadil! name voice seemed grow strong: full lively sound, dark chamber echoed drum trumpet. Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! By water, wood hill, reed willow, By fire, sun moon, harken hear us! Come, Tom Bombadil, need near us! There sudden deep silence, Frodo could hear heart beating. After long slow moment heard plain, far away, coming ground thick walls, answering voice singing: Old Tom Bombadil merry fellow, Bright blue jacket is, boots yellow. None ever caught yet, Tom, master: His songs stronger songs, feet faster. There loud rumbling sound, stones rolling falling, suddenly light streamed in, real light, plain light day. A low door-like opening appeared end chamber beyond Frodo’s feet; Tom’s head (hat, feather, all) framed light sun rising red behind him. The light fell upon floor, upon faces three hobbits lying beside Frodo. They stir, sickly hue left them. They looked deeply asleep. Tom stooped, removed hat, came dark chamber, singing: Get out, old Wight! Vanish sunlight! Shrivel like cold mist, like winds go wailing, Out barren lands far beyond mountains! Come never again! Leave barrow empty! Lost forgotten be, darker darkness, Where gates stand ever shut, till world mended. At words cry part inner end chamber fell crash. Then long trailing shriek, fading away unguessable distance; silence. ‘Come, friend Frodo!’ said Tom. ‘Let us get clean grass! You must help bear them.’ Together carried Merry, Pippin, Sam. As Frodo left barrow last time thought saw severed hand wriggling still, like wounded spider, heap fallen earth. Tom went back again, sound much thumping stamping. When came bearing arms great load treasure: things gold, silver, copper, bronze; many beads chains jewelled ornaments. He climbed green barrow laid top sunshine. There stood, hat hand wind hair, looked upon three hobbits, laid backs upon grass west side mound. Raising right hand said clear commanding voice: Wake merry lads! Wake hear calling! Warm heart limb! The cold stone fallen; Dark door standing wide; dead hand broken. Night Night flown, Gate open! To Frodo’s great joy hobbits stirred, stretched arms, rubbed eyes, suddenly sprang up. They looked amazement, first Frodo, Tom standing large life barrow-top them; thin white rags, crowned belted pale gold, jingling trinkets. ‘What name wonder?’ began Merry, feeling golden circlet slipped one eye. Then stopped, shadow came face, closed eyes. ‘Of course, I remember!’ said. ‘The men Carn Duˆm came us night, worsted. Ah! spear heart!’ He clutched breast. ‘No! No!’ said, opening eyes. ‘What I saying? I dreaming. Where get to, Frodo?’ ‘I thought I lost,’ said Frodo; ‘but I don’t want speak it. Let us think now! Let us go on!’ ‘Dressed like this, sir?’ said Sam. ‘Where clothes?’ He flung circlet, belt, rings grass, looked round helplessly, expected find cloak, jacket, breeches, hobbit-garments lying somewhere hand. ‘You won’t find clothes again,’ said Tom, bounding mound, laughing danced round sunlight. One would thought nothing dangerous dreadful happened; indeed horror faded hearts looked him, saw merry glint eyes. ‘What mean?’ asked Pippin, looking him, half puzzled half amused. ‘Why not?’ But Tom shook head, saying: ‘You’ve found again, deep water. Clothes little loss, escape drowning. Be glad, merry friends, let warm sunlight heat heart limb! Cast cold rags! Run naked grass, Tom goes a-hunting!’ He sprang away hill, whistling calling. Looking Frodo saw running away southwards along green hollow hill next, still whistling crying: Hey! now! Come hoy now! Whither wander? Up, down, near far, here, yonder? Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail Bumpkin, White-socks little lad, old Fatty Lumpkin! So sang, running fast, tossing hat catching it, hidden fold ground: time hey now! hoy now! came floating back wind, shifted round towards south. The air growing warm again. The hobbits ran grass, told them. Then lay basking sun delight wafted suddenly bitter winter friendly clime, people that, long ill bedridden, wake one day find unexpectedly well day full promise. By time Tom returned feeling strong (and hungry). He reappeared, hat first, brow hill, behind came obedient line six ponies: five one more. The last plainly old Fatty Lumpkin: larger, stronger, fatter (and older) ponies. Merry, others belonged, not, fact, given names, answered new names Tom given rest lives. Tom called one one climbed brow stood line. Then Tom bowed hobbits. ‘Here ponies, now!’ said. ‘They’ve sense (in ways) wandering hobbits – sense noses. For sniff danger ahead walk right into; run save themselves, run right way. You must forgive all; though hearts faithful, face fear Barrow-wights made for. See, come again, bringing burdens!’ Merry, Sam, Pippin clothed spare garments packs; soon felt hot, obliged put thicker warmer things brought oncoming winter. ‘Where old animal, Fatty Lumpkin, come from?’ asked Frodo. ‘He’s mine,’ said Tom. ‘My four-legged friend; though I seldom ride him, wanders often far, free upon hillsides. When ponies stayed me, got know Lumpkin; smelt night, quickly ran meet him. I thought he’d look words wisdom take fear away. But now, jolly Lumpkin, old Tom’s going ride. Hey! he’s coming you, set road; needs pony. For cannot easily talk hobbits riding, you’re legs trying trot beside them.’ The hobbits delighted hear this, thanked Tom many times; laughed, said good losing would feel happy till seen safe borders land. ‘I’ve got things do,’ said: ‘my making singing, talking walking, watching country. Tom can’t always near open doors willow-cracks. Tom house mind, Goldberry waiting.’ It still fairly early sun, something nine ten, hobbits turned minds food. Their last meal lunch beside standing stone day before. They breakfasted remainder Tom’s provisions, meant supper, additions Tom brought him. It large meal (considering hobbits circumstances), felt much better it. While eating Tom went mound, looked treasures. Most made pile glistered sparkled grass. He bade lie ‘free finders, birds, beasts, Elves Men, kindly creatures’; spell mound broken scattered Wight ever come back it. He chose pile brooch set blue stones, many-shaded like flax-flowers wings blue butterflies. He looked long it, stirred memory, shaking head, saying last: ‘Here pretty toy Tom lady! Fair long ago wore shoulder. Goldberry shall wear now, forget her!’ For hobbits chose dagger, long, leafshaped, keen, marvellous workmanship, damasked serpent-forms red gold. They gleamed drew black sheaths, wrought strange metal, light strong, set many fiery stones. Whether virtue sheaths spell lay mound, blades seemed untouched time, unrusted, sharp, glittering sun. ‘Old knives long enough swords hobbit-people,’ said. ‘Sharp blades good have, Shire-folk go walking, east, south, far away dark danger.’ Then told blades forged many long years ago Men Westernesse: foes Dark Lord, overcome evil king Carn Duˆm Land Angmar. ‘Few remember them,’ Tom murmured, ‘yet still go wandering, sons forgotten kings walking loneliness, guarding evil things folk heedless.’ The hobbits understand words, spoke vision great expanse years behind them, like vast shadowy plain strode shapes Men, tall grim bright swords, last came one star brow. Then vision faded, back sunlit world. It time start again. They made ready, packing bags lading ponies. Their new weapons hung leather belts jackets, feeling awkward, wondering would use. Fighting occurred one adventures flight would land them. At last set off. They led ponies hill; mounting trotted quickly along valley. They looked back saw top old mound hill, sunlight gold went like yellow flame. Then turned shoulder Downs hidden view. Though Frodo looked every side saw sign great stones standing like gate, long came northern gap rode swiftly through, land fell away them. It merry journey Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside them, them, Fatty Lumpkin, could move much faster girth promised. Tom sang time, chiefly nonsense, else perhaps strange language unknown hobbits, ancient language whose words mainly wonder delight. They went forward steadily, soon saw Road away imagined. Even without fog, sleep mid-day would prevented reaching nightfall day before. The dark line seen line trees line bushes growing edge deep dike steep wall side. Tom said boundary kingdom, long time ago. He seemed remember something sad it, would say much. They climbed dike gap wall, Tom turned due north, bearing somewhat west. The land open fairly level, quickened pace, sun already sinking low last saw line tall trees ahead, knew come back Road many unexpected adventures. They galloped ponies last furlongs, halted long shadows trees. They top sloping bank, Road, dim evening drew on, wound away them. At point ran nearly South-west North-east, right fell quickly wide hollow. It rutted bore many signs recent heavy rain; pools pot-holes full water. They rode bank looked down. There nothing seen. ‘Well, last!’ said Frodo. ‘I suppose haven’t lost two days short cut Forest! But perhaps delay prove useful – may put trail.’ The others looked him. The shadow fear Black Riders came suddenly again. Ever since entered Forest thought chiefly getting back Road; lay beneath feet remember danger pursued them, likely lying wait upon Road itself. They looked anxiously back towards setting sun, Road brown empty. ‘Do think,’ asked Pippin hesitatingly, ‘do think may pursued, tonight?’ ‘No, I hope tonight,’ answered Tom Bombadil; ‘nor perhaps next day. But trust guess; I cannot tell certain. Out east knowledge fails. Tom master Riders Black Land far beyond country.’ All hobbits wished coming them. They felt would know deal Black Riders, anyone did. They would soon going forward lands wholly strange them, beyond vague distant legends Shire, gathering twilight longed home. A deep loneliness sense loss them. They stood silent, reluctant make final parting, slowly became aware Tom wishing farewell, telling good heart ride till dark without halting. ‘Tom give good advice, till day (after luck must go guide you): four miles along Road you’ll come upon village, Bree Bree-hill, doors looking westward. There you’ll find old inn called The Prancing Pony. Barliman Butterbur worthy keeper. There stay night, afterwards morning speed upon way. Be bold, wary! Keep merry hearts, ride meet fortune!’ They begged come least far inn drink them; laughed refused, saying: Tom’s country ends here: pass borders. Tom house mind, Goldberry waiting! Then turned, tossed hat, leaped Lumpkin’s back, rode bank away singing dusk. The hobbits climbed watched sight. ‘I sorry take leave Master Bombadil,’ said Sam. ‘He’s caution mistake. I reckon may go good deal see naught better, queerer. But I won’t deny I’ll glad see Prancing Pony spoke of. I hope it’ll like The Green Dragon away back home! What sort folk Bree?’ ‘There hobbits Bree,’ said Merry, ‘as well Big Folk. I daresay homelike enough. The Pony good inn accounts. My people ride again.’ ‘It may could wish,’ said Frodo; ‘but outside Shire same. Don’t make much home! Please remember – – name Baggins must mentioned. I Mr. Underhill, name must given.’ They mounted ponies rode silently evening. Darkness came quickly, plodded slowly downhill again, last saw lights twinkling distance ahead. Before rose Bree-hill barring way, dark mass misty stars; western flank nestled large village. Towards hurried desiring find fire, door night. Chapter 9 AT THE SIGN OF THE PRANCING PONY Bree chief village Bree-land, small inhabited region, like island empty lands round about. Besides Bree itself, Staddle side hill, Combe deep valley little eastward, Archet edge Chetwood. Lying round Bree-hill villages small country fields tamed woodland miles broad. The Men Bree brown-haired, broad, rather short, cheerful independent: belonged nobody themselves; friendly familiar Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, inhabitants world (or is) usual Big People. According tales original inhabitants descendants first Men ever wandered West middle-world. Few survived turmoils Elder Days; Kings returned Great Sea found Bree-men still there, still now, memory old Kings faded grass. In days Men settled dwellings far west, within hundred leagues Shire. But wild lands beyond Bree mysterious wanderers. The Bree-folk called Rangers, knew nothing origin. They taller darker Men Bree believed strange powers sight hearing, understand languages beasts birds. They roamed southwards, eastwards even far Misty Mountains; rarely seen. When appeared brought news afar, told strange forgotten tales eagerly listened to; Bree-folk make friends them. There also many families hobbits Bree-land; claimed oldest settlement Hobbits world, one founded long even Brandywine crossed Shire colonized. They lived mostly Staddle though Bree itself, especially higher slopes hill, houses Men. The Big Folk Little Folk (as called one another) friendly terms, minding affairs ways, rightly regarding necessary parts Bree-folk. Nowhere else world peculiar (but excellent) arrangement found. The Bree-folk, Big Little, travel much; affairs four villages chief concern. Occasionally Hobbits Bree went far Buckland, Eastfarthing; though little land much day’s riding east Brandywine Bridge, Hobbits Shire seldom visited it. An occasional Bucklander adventurous Took would come Inn night two, even becoming less less usual. The Shire-hobbits referred Bree, others lived beyond borders, Outsiders, took little interest them, considering dull uncouth. There probably many Outsiders scattered West World days people Shire imagined. Some, doubtless, better tramps, ready dig hole bank stay long suited them. But Bree-land, rate, hobbits decent prosperous, rustic distant relatives Inside. It yet forgotten time much coming going Shire Bree. There Bree-blood Brandybucks accounts. The village Bree hundred stone houses Big Folk, mostly Road, nestling hillside windows looking west. On side, running half circle hill back it, deep dike thick hedge inner side. Over Road crossed causeway; pierced hedge barred great gate. There another gate southern corner Road ran village. The gates closed nightfall; inside small lodges gatekeepers. Down Road, swept right go round foot hill, large inn. It built long ago traffic roads far greater. For Bree stood old meeting ways; another ancient road crossed East Road outside dike western end village, former days Men folk various sorts travelled much it. Strange News Bree still saying Eastfarthing, descending days, news North, South, East could heard inn, Shire-hobbits used go often hear it. But Northern Lands long desolate, North Road seldom used: grass-grown, Bree-folk called Greenway. The Inn Bree still there, however, innkeeper important person. His house meeting place idle, talkative, inquisitive among inhabitants, large small, four villages; resort Rangers wanderers, travellers (mostly dwarves) still journeyed East Road, Mountains. It dark, white stars shining, Frodo companions came last Greenway-crossing drew near village. They came West-gate found shut; door lodge beyond it, man sitting. He jumped fetched lantern looked gate surprise. ‘What want, come from?’ asked gruffly. ‘We making inn here,’ answered Frodo. ‘We journeying east cannot go tonight.’ ‘Hobbits! Four hobbits! And what’s more, Shire talk,’ said gatekeeper, softly speaking himself. He stared darkly moment, slowly opened gate let ride through. ‘We don’t often see Shire-folk riding Road night,’ went on, halted moment door. ‘You’ll pardon wondering business takes away east Bree! What may names be, might I ask?’ ‘Our names business own, seem good place discuss them,’ said Frodo, liking look man tone voice. ‘Your business own, doubt,’ said man; ‘but it’s business ask questions nightfall.’ ‘We hobbits Buckland, fancy travel stay inn here,’ put Merry. ‘I Mr. Brandybuck. Is enough you? The Bree-folk used fair-spoken travellers, I heard.’ ‘All right, right!’ said man. ‘I meant offence. But you’ll find maybe folk old Harry gate asking questions. There’s queer folk about. If go The Pony, you’ll find you’re guests.’ He wished good night, said more; Frodo could see lantern-light man still eyeing curiously. He glad hear gate clang behind them, rode forward. He wondered man suspicious, whether anyone asking news party hobbits. Could Gandalf? He might arrived, delayed Forest Downs. But something look voice gatekeeper made uneasy. The man stared hobbits moment, went back house. As soon back turned, dark figure climbed quickly gate melted shadows village street. * * * The hobbits rode gentle slope, passing detached houses, drew outside inn. The houses lookedlargeandstrangetothem.Samstaredupattheinnwith three storeys many windows, felt heart sink. He imagined meeting giants taller trees, creatures even terrifying, time course journey; moment finding first sight Men tall houses quite enough, indeed much dark end tiring day. He pictured black horses standing saddled shadows inn-yard, Black Riders peering dark upper windows. ‘We surely aren’t going stay night, we, sir?’ exclaimed. ‘If hobbit-folk parts, don’t look would willing take us in? It would homelike.’ ‘What’s wrong inn?’ said Frodo. ‘Tom Bombadil recommended it. I expect it’s homelike enough inside.’ Even outside inn looked pleasant house familiar eyes. It front Road, two wings running back land partly cut lower slopes hill, rear second-floor windows level ground. There wide arch leading courtyard two wings, left arch large doorway reached broad steps. The door open light streamed it. Above arch lamp, beneath swung large signboard: fat white pony reared hind legs. Over door painted white letters: prancing pony barliman butterbur. Many lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains. As hesitated outside gloom, someone began singing merry song inside, many cheerful voices joined loudly chorus. They listened encouraging sound moment got ponies. The song ended burst laughter clapping. They led ponies arch, leaving standing yard climbed steps. Frodo went forward nearly bumped short fat man bald head red face. He white apron on, bustling one door another, carrying tray laden full mugs. ‘Can we——’ began Frodo. ‘Half minute, please!’ shouted man shoulder, vanished babel voices cloud smoke. In moment again, wiping hands apron. ‘Good evening, little master!’ said, bending down. ‘What may wanting?’ ‘Beds four, stabling five ponies, managed. Are Mr. Butterbur?’ ‘That’s right! Barliman name. Barliman Butterbur service! You’re Shire, eh?’ said, suddenly clapped hand forehead, trying remember something. ‘Hobbits!’ cried. ‘Now remind of? Might I ask names, sirs?’ ‘Mr. Took Mr. Brandybuck,’ said Frodo; ‘and Sam Gamgee. My name Underhill.’ ‘There now!’ said Mr. Butterbur, snapping fingers. ‘It’s gone again! But it’ll come back, I time think. I’m run feet; I’ll see I you. We don’t often get party Shire nowadays, I sorry make welcome. But crowd already house tonight hasn’t long enough. It never rains pours, say Bree.’ ‘Hi! Nob!’ shouted. ‘Where you, woolly-footed slowcoach? Nob!’ ‘Coming, sir! Coming!’ A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed door, seeing travellers, stopped short stared great interest. ‘Where’s Bob?’ asked landlord. ‘You don’t know? Well, find him! Double sharp! I haven’t got six legs, six eyes neither! Tell Bob there’s five ponies stabled. He must find room somehow.’ Nob trotted grin wink. ‘Well now, I going say?’ said Mr. Butterbur, tapping forehead. ‘One thing drives another, speak. I’m busy tonight, head going round. There’s party came Greenway South last night – strange enough begin with. Then there’s travelling company dwarves going West come evening. And there’s you. If weren’t hobbits, I doubt could house you. But we’ve got room two north wing made special hobbits, place built. On ground floor usually prefer; round windows like it. I hope you’ll comfortable. You’ll wanting supper, I don’t doubt. As soon may be. This way now!’ He led short way passage, opened door. ‘Here nice little parlour!’ said. ‘I hope suit. Excuse now. I’m busy. No time talking. I must trotting. It’s hard work two legs, I don’t get thinner. I’ll look later. If want anything, ring hand-bell, Nob come. If don’t come, ring shout!’ Off went last, left feeling rather breathless. He seemed capable endless stream talk, however busy might be. They found small cosy room. There bit bright fire burning hearth, front low comfortable chairs. There round table, already spread white cloth, large hand-bell. But Nob, hobbit servant, came bustling long thought ringing. He brought candles tray full plates. ‘Will wanting anything drink, masters?’ asked. ‘And shall I show bedrooms, supper got ready?’ They washed middle good deep mugs beer Mr. Butterbur Nob came again. In twinkling table laid. There hot soup, cold meats, blackberry tart, new loaves, slabs butter, half ripe cheese: good plain food, good Shire could show, homelike enough dispel last Sam’s misgivings (already much relieved excellence beer). The landlord hovered round little, prepared leave them. ‘I don’t know whether would care join company, supped,’ said, standing door. ‘Perhaps would rather go beds. Still company would pleased welcome you, mind. We don’t get Outsiders – travellers Shire, I say, begging pardon – often; like hear bit news, story song may mind. But please! Ring bell, lack anything!’ So refreshed encouraged feel end supper (about three quarters hour’s steady going, hindered unnecessary talk) Frodo, Pippin, Sam decided join company. Merry said would stuffy. ‘I shall sit quietly fire bit, perhaps go later sniff air. Mind Ps Qs, don’t forget supposed escaping secret, still high-road far Shire!’ ‘All right!’ said Pippin. ‘Mind yourself! Don’t get lost, don’t forget safer indoors!’ The company big common-room inn. The gathering large mixed, Frodo discovered, eyes got used light. This came chiefly blazing log-fire, three lamps hanging beams dim, half veiled smoke. Barliman Butterbur standing near fire, talking couple dwarves one two strange-looking men. On benches various folk: men Bree, collection local hobbits (sitting chattering together), dwarves, vague figures difficult make away shadows corners. As soon Shire-hobbits entered, chorus welcome Bree-landers. The strangers, especially come Greenway, stared curiously. The landlord introduced newcomers Bree-folk, quickly that, though caught many names, seldom sure names belonged to. The Men Bree seemed rather botanical (and Shirefolk rather odd) names, like Rushlight, Goatleaf, Heathertoes, Appledore, Thistlewool Ferny (not mention Butterbur). Some hobbits similar names. The Mugworts, instance, seemed numerous. But natural names, Banks, Brockhouse, Longholes, Sandheaver, Tunnelly, many used Shire. There several Underhills Staddle, could imagine sharing name without related, took Frodo hearts long-lost cousin. The Bree-hobbits were, fact, friendly inquisitive, Frodo soon found explanation would given. He gave interested history geography (at much wagging heads, although neither words much used Bree-dialect). He said thinking writing book (at silent astonishment), friends wanted collect information hobbits living outside Shire, especially eastern lands. At chorus voices broke out. If Frodo really wanted write book, many ears, would learned enough several chapters minutes. And enough, given whole list names, beginning ‘Old Barliman here’, could go information. But time, Frodo show sign writing book spot, hobbits returned questions doings Shire. Frodo prove communicative, soon found sitting alone corner, listening looking around. The Men Dwarves mostly talking distant events telling news kind becoming familiar. There trouble away South, seemed Men come Greenway move, looking lands could find peace. The Bree-folk sympathetic, plainly ready take large number strangers little land. One travellers, squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow, foretelling people would coming north near future. ‘If room isn’t found them, they’ll find themselves. They’ve right live, folk,’ said loudly. The local inhabitants look pleased prospect. The hobbits pay much attention this, moment seem concern hobbits. Big Folk could hardly beg lodgings hobbit-holes. They interested Sam Pippin, feeling quite home, chatting gaily events Shire. Pippin roused good deal laughter account collapse roof Town Hole Michel Delving: Will Whitfoot, Mayor, fattest hobbit Westfarthing, buried chalk, came like floured dumpling. But several questions asked made Frodo little uneasy. One Breelanders, seemed Shire several times, wanted know Underhills lived related to. Suddenly Frodo noticed strange-looking weatherbeaten man, sitting shadows near wall, also listening intently hobbit-talk. He tall tankard front him, smoking long-stemmed pipe curiously carved. His legs stretched him, showing high boots supple leather fitted well, seen much wear caked mud. A travel-stained cloak heavy dark-green cloth drawn close him, spite heat room wore hood overshadowed face; gleam eyes could seen watched hobbits. ‘Who that?’ Frodo asked, got chance whisper Mr. Butterbur. ‘I don’t think introduced him?’ ‘Him?’ said landlord answering whisper, cocking eye without turning head. ‘I don’t rightly know. He one wandering folk – Rangers call them. He seldom talks: tell rare tale mind. He disappears month, year, pops again. He pretty often last spring; I haven’t seen lately. What right name I’ve never heard: he’s known round Strider. Goes great pace long shanks; though don’t tell nobody cause hurry. But there’s accounting East West, say Bree, meaning Rangers Shire-folk, begging pardon. Funny ask him.’ But moment Mr. Butterbur called away demand ale last remark remained unexplained. Frodo found Strider looking him, heard guessed said. Presently, wave hand nod, invited Frodo come sit him. As Frodo drew near threw back hood, showing shaggy head dark hair flecked grey, pale stern face pair keen grey eyes. ‘I called Strider,’ said low voice. ‘I pleased meet you, Master – Underhill, old Butterbur got name right.’ ‘He did,’ said Frodo stiffly. He felt far comfortable stare keen eyes. ‘Well, Master Underhill,’ said Strider, ‘if I you, I stop young friends talking much. Drink, fire, chance-meeting pleasant enough, but, well – isn’t Shire. There queer folk about. Though I say shouldn’t, may think,’ added wry smile, seeing Frodo’s glance. ‘And even stranger travellers Bree lately,’ went on, watching Frodo’s face. Frodo returned gaze said nothing; Strider made sign. His attention seemed suddenly fixed Pippin. To alarm Frodo became aware ridiculous young Took, encouraged success fat Mayor Michel Delving, actually giving comic account Bilbo’s farewell party. He already giving imitation Speech, drawing near astonishing Disappearance. Frodo annoyed. It harmless enough tale local hobbits, doubt: funny story funny people away beyond River; (old Butterbur, instance) knew thing two, probably heard rumours long ago Bilbo’s vanishing. It would bring name Baggins minds, especially inquiries Bree name. Frodo fidgeted, wondering do. Pippin evidently much enjoying attention getting, become quite forgetful danger. Frodo sudden fear present mood might even mention Ring; might well disastrous. ‘You better something quick!’ whispered Strider ear. Frodo jumped stood table, began talk. The attention Pippin’s audience disturbed. Some hobbits looked Frodo laughed clapped, thinking Mr. Underhill taken much ale good him. Frodo suddenly felt foolish, found (as habit making speech) fingering things pocket. He felt Ring chain, quite unaccountably desire came slip vanish silly situation. It seemed him, somehow, suggestion came outside, someone something room. He resisted temptation firmly, clasped Ring hand, keep hold prevent escaping mischief. At rate gave inspiration. He spoke ‘a suitable words’, would said Shire: We much gratified kindness reception, I venture hope brief visit help renew old ties friendship Shire Bree; hesitated coughed. Everyone room looking him. ‘A song!’ shouted one hobbits. ‘A song! A song!’ shouted others. ‘Come now, master, sing us something haven’t heard before!’ For moment Frodo stood gaping. Then desperation began ridiculous song Bilbo rather fond (and indeed rather proud of, made words himself). It inn; probably came Frodo’s mind then. Here full. Only words now, rule, remembered. There inn, merry old inn beneath old grey hill, And brew beer brown That Man Moon came one night drink fill. The ostler tipsy cat plays five-stringed fiddle; And runs bow, Now squeaking high, purring low, sawing middle. The landlord keeps little dog mighty fond jokes; When there’s good cheer among guests, He cocks ear jests laughs chokes. They also keep horne´d cow proud queen; But music turns head like ale, And makes wave tufted tail dance upon green. And O! rows silver dishes store silver spoons! For Sunday* there’s special pair, And polish care Saturday afternoons. The Man Moon drinking deep, cat began wail; A dish spoon table danced, The cow garden madly pranced, little dog chased tail. The Man Moon took another mug, rolled beneath chair; And dozed dreamed ale, Till sky stars pale, dawn air. Then ostler said tipsy cat: ‘The white horses Moon, They neigh champ silver bits; But master’s drowned wits, Sun’ll rising soon!’ So cat fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle, jig would wake dead: He squeaked sawed quickened tune, While landlord shook Man Moon: ‘It’s three!’ said. They rolled Man slowly hill bundled Moon, While horses galloped rear, And cow came capering like deer, dish ran spoon. * See note 2, III, p. 1462 Now quicker fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle; dog began roar, The cow horses stood heads; The guests bounded beds danced upon floor. With ping pong fiddle-strings broke! cow jumped Moon, And little dog laughed see fun, And Saturday dish went run silver Sunday spoon. The round Moon rolled behind hill Sun raised head. She* hardly believed fiery eyes; For though day, surprise went back bed! There loud long applause. Frodo good voice, song tickled fancy. ‘Where’s old Barley?’ cried. ‘He ought hear this. Bob ought learn cat fiddle, we’d dance.’ They called ale, began shout: ‘Let’s again, master! Come now! Once more!’ They made Frodo another drink, begin song again, many joined in; tune well known, quick picking words. It Frodo’s turn feel pleased himself. He capered table; came second time cow jumped Moon, leaped air. Much vigorously; came down, bang, tray full mugs, slipped, rolled table crash, clatter, bump! The audience opened mouths wide laughter, stopped short gaping silence; singer * Elves (and Hobbits) always refer Sun She. disappeared. He simply vanished, gone slap floor without leaving hole! The local hobbits stared amazement, sprang feet shouted Barliman. All company drew away Pippin Sam, found left alone corner, eyed darkly doubtfully distance. It plain many people regarded companions travelling magician unknown powers purpose. But one swarthy Bree-lander, stood looking knowing half-mocking expression made feel uncomfortable. Presently slipped door, followed squint-eyed southerner: two whispering together good deal evening. Frodo felt fool. Not knowing else do, crawled away tables dark corner Strider, sat unmoved, giving sign thoughts. Frodo leaned back wall took Ring. How came finger could tell. He could suppose handling pocket sang, somehow slipped stuck hand jerk save fall. For moment wondered Ring played trick; perhaps tried reveal response wish command felt room. He like looks men gone out. ‘Well?’ said Strider, reappeared. ‘Why that? Worse anything friends could said! You put foot it! Or I say finger?’ ‘I don’t know mean,’ said Frodo, annoyed alarmed. ‘Oh yes, do,’ answered Strider; ‘but better wait uproar died down. Then, please, Mr. Baggins, I like quiet word you.’ ‘What about?’ asked Frodo, ignoring sudden use proper name. ‘A matter importance – us both,’ answered Strider, looking Frodo eye. ‘You may hear something advantage.’ ‘Very well,’ said Frodo, trying appear unconcerned. ‘I’ll talk later.’ Meanwhile argument going fireplace. Mr. Butterbur come trotting in, trying listen several conflicting accounts event time. ‘I saw him, Mr. Butterbur,’ said hobbit; ‘or leastways I didn’t see him, take meaning. He vanished thin air, manner speaking.’ ‘You don’t say, Mr. Mugwort!’ said landlord, looking puzzled. ‘Yes I do!’ replied Mugwort. ‘And I mean I say, what’s more.’ ‘There’s mistake somewhere,’ said Butterbur, shaking head. ‘There much Mr. Underhill go vanishing thin air; thick air, likely room.’ ‘Well, now?’ cried several voices. ‘How I know? He’s welcome go will, long pays morning. There’s Mr. Took, now: he’s vanished.’ ‘Well, I saw I saw, I saw I didn’t,’ said Mugwort obstinately. ‘And I say there’s mistake,’ repeated Butterbur, picking tray gathering broken crockery. ‘Of course there’s mistake!’ said Frodo. ‘I haven’t vanished. Here I am! I’ve words Strider corner.’ He came forward firelight; company backed away, even perturbed before. They least satisfied explanation crawled away quickly tables fallen. Most Hobbits Men Bree went huff, fancy entertainment evening. One two gave Frodo black look departed muttering among themselves. The Dwarves two three strange Men still remained got said good night landlord, Frodo friends. Before long one left Strider, sat on, unnoticed, wall. Mr. Butterbur seem much put out. He reckoned, probably, house would full many future nights, present mystery thoroughly discussed. ‘Now doing, Mr. Underhill?’ asked. ‘Frightening customers breaking crocks acrobatics!’ ‘I sorry caused trouble,’ said Frodo. ‘It quite unintentional, I assure you. A unfortunate accident.’ ‘All right, Mr. Underhill! But you’re going tumbling, conjuring, whatever was, you’d best warn folk beforehand – warn me. We’re bit suspicious round anything way – uncanny, understand me; don’t take sudden.’ ‘I shan’t anything sort again, Mr. Butterbur, I promise you. And I think I’ll getting bed. We shall making early start. Will see ponies ready eight o’clock?’ ‘Very good! But go, I like word private, Mr. Underhill. Something come back mind I ought tell you. I hope you’ll take amiss. When I’ve seen thing two, I’ll come along room, you’re willing.’ ‘Certainly!’ said Frodo; heart sank. He wondered many private talks would got bed, would reveal. Were people league him? He began suspect even old Butterbur’s fat face concealing dark designs. Chapter 10 STRIDER Frodo, Pippin, Sam made way back parlour. There light. Merry there, fire burned low. It puffed embers blaze thrown couple faggots discovered Strider come them. There calmly sitting chair door! ‘Hallo!’ said Pippin. ‘Who you, want?’ ‘I called Strider,’ answered; ‘and though may forgotten it, friend promised quiet talk me.’ ‘You said I might hear something advantage, I believe,’ said Frodo. ‘What say?’ ‘Several things,’ answered Strider. ‘But, course, I price.’ ‘What mean?’ asked Frodo sharply. ‘Don’t alarmed! I mean this: I tell I know, give good advice – I shall want reward.’ ‘And be, pray?’ said Frodo. He suspected fallen rascal, thought uncomfortably brought little money him. All would hardly satisfy rogue, could spare it. ‘No afford,’ answered Strider slow smile, guessed Frodo’s thoughts. ‘Just this: must take along you, I wish leave you.’ ‘Oh, indeed!’ replied Frodo, surprised, much relieved. ‘Even I wanted another companion, I agree thing, I knew good deal you, business.’ ‘Excellent!’ exclaimed Strider, crossing legs sitting back comfortably. ‘You seem coming senses again, good. You much careless far. Very well! I tell I know, leave reward you. You may glad grant it, heard me.’ ‘Go then!’ said Frodo. ‘What know?’ ‘Too much; many dark things,’ said Strider grimly. ‘But business——’ He got went door, opened quickly looked out. Then shut quietly sat again. ‘I quick ears,’ went on, lowering voice, ‘and though I cannot disappear, I hunted many wild wary things I usually avoid seen, I wish. Now, I behind hedge evening Road west Bree, four hobbits came Downlands. I need repeat said old Bombadil one another; one thing interested me. Please remember, said one them, name Baggins must mentioned. I Mr. Underhill, name must given. That interested much I followed here. I slipped gate behind them. Maybe Mr. Baggins honest reason leaving name behind; so, I advise friends careful.’ ‘I don’t see interest name anyone Bree,’ said Frodo angrily, ‘and I still learn interests you. Mr. Strider may honest reason spying eavesdropping; so, I advise explain it.’ ‘Well answered!’ said Strider laughing. ‘But explanation simple: I looking Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. I wanted find quickly. I learned carrying Shire, well, secret concerned friends. ‘Now, don’t mistake me!’ cried, Frodo rose seat, Sam jumped scowl. ‘I shall take care secret do. And care needed!’ He leaned forward looked them. ‘Watch every shadow!’ said low voice. ‘Black horsemen passed Bree. On Monday one came Greenway, say; another appeared later, coming Greenway south.’ There silence. At last Frodo spoke Pippin Sam: ‘I ought guessed way gatekeeper greeted us,’ said. ‘And landlord seems heard something. Why press us join company? And earth behave foolishly: ought stayed quiet here.’ ‘It would better,’ said Strider. ‘I would stopped going common-room, I could; innkeeper would let see you, take message.’ ‘Do think he——’ began Frodo. ‘No, I don’t think harm old Butterbur. Only altogether like mysterious vagabonds sort.’ Frodo gave puzzled look. ‘Well, I rather rascally look, I not?’ said Strider curl lip queer gleam eye. ‘But I hope shall get know one another better. When do, I hope explain happened end song. For little prank——’ ‘It sheer accident!’ interrupted Frodo. ‘I wonder,’ said Strider. ‘Accident, then. That accident made position dangerous.’ ‘Hardly already,’ said Frodo. ‘I knew horsemen pursuing me; rate seem missed gone away.’ ‘You must count that!’ said Strider sharply. ‘They return. And coming. There others. I know number. I know Riders.’ He paused, eyes cold hard. ‘And folk Bree trusted,’ went on. ‘Bill Ferny, instance. He evil name Bree-land, queer folk call house. You must noticed among company: swarthy sneering fellow. He close one Southern strangers, slipped together ‘‘accident’’. Not Southerners mean well; Ferny, would sell anything anybody; make mischief amusement.’ ‘What Ferny sell, accident got him?’ said Frodo, still determined understand Strider’s hints. ‘News you, course,’ answered Strider. ‘An account performance would interesting certain people. After would hardly need told real name. It seems likely hear night over. Is enough? You like reward: take guide not. But I may say I know lands Shire Misty Mountains, I wandered many years. I older I look. I might prove useful. You leave open road tonight; horsemen watch night day. You may escape Bree, allowed go forward Sun up; won’t go far. They come wild, dark place help. Do wish find you? They terrible!’ The hobbits looked him, saw surprise face drawn pain, hands clenched arms chair. The room quiet still, light seemed grown dim. For sat unseeing eyes walking distant memory listening sounds Night far away. ‘There!’ cried moment, drawing hand across brow. ‘Perhaps I know pursuers do. You fear them, fear enough, yet. Tomorrow escape, can. Strider take paths seldom trodden. Will him?’ There heavy silence. Frodo made answer; mind confused doubt fear. Sam frowned, looked master; last broke out: ‘With leave, Mr. Frodo, I’d say no! This Strider here, warns says take care; I say yes that, let’s begin him. He comes Wild, I never heard good folk. He knows something, that’s plain, I like; it’s reason let go leading us dark place far help, puts it.’ Pippin fidgeted looked uncomfortable. Strider reply Sam, turned keen eyes Frodo. Frodo caught glance looked away. ‘No,’ said slowly. ‘I don’t agree. I think, I think really choose look. You began talk like Bree-folk, voice changed. Still Sam seems right this: I don’t see warn us take care, yet ask us take trust. Why disguise? Who you? What really know – business; know it?’ ‘The lesson caution well learned,’ said Strider grim smile. ‘But caution one thing wavering another. You never get Rivendell own, trust chance. You must make mind. I answer questions, help so. But believe story, trust already? Still is——’ At moment came knock door. Mr. Butterbur arrived candles, behind Nob cans hot water. Strider withdrew dark corner. ‘I’ve come bid good night,’ said landlord, putting candles table. ‘Nob! Take water rooms!’ He came shut door. ‘It’s like this,’ began, hesitating looking troubled. ‘If I’ve done harm, I’m sorry indeed. But one thing drives another, you’ll admit; I’m busy man. But first one thing another week jogged memory, saying goes; late I hope. You see, I asked look hobbits Shire, one name Baggins particular.’ ‘And got me?’ asked Frodo. ‘Ah! know best,’ said landlord, knowingly. ‘I won’t give away; I told Baggins would going name Underhill, I given description fits well enough, I may say so.’ ‘Indeed! Let’s then!’ said Frodo, unwisely interrupting. ‘A stout little fellow red cheeks,’ said Mr. Butterbur solemnly. Pippin chuckled, Sam looked indignant. ‘That won’t help much; goes hobbits, Barley, says me,’ continued Mr. Butterbur glance Pippin. ‘But one taller fairer most, cleft chin: perky chap bright eye. Begging pardon, said it, me.’ ‘He said it? And he?’ asked Frodo eagerly. ‘Ah! That Gandalf, know I mean. A wizard say is, he’s good friend mine, whether no. But I don’t know he’ll say me, I see again: turn ale sour block wood, I shouldn’t wonder. He’s bit hasty. Still what’s done can’t undone.’ ‘Well, done?’ said Frodo, getting impatient slow unravelling Butterbur’s thoughts. ‘Where I?’ said landlord, pausing snapping fingers. ‘Ah, yes! Old Gandalf. Three months back walked right room without knock. Barley, says, I’m morning. Will something me? You’ve name it, I said. I’m hurry, said he, I’ve time myself, I want message took Shire. Have anyone send, trust go? I find someone, I said, tomorrow, maybe, day after. Make tomorrow, says, gave letter. ‘It’s addressed plain enough,’ said Mr. Butterbur, producing letter pocket, reading address slowly proudly (he valued reputation lettered man): Mr. FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON SHIRE. ‘A letter Gandalf!’ cried Frodo. ‘Ah!’ said Mr. Butterbur. ‘Then right name Baggins?’ ‘It is,’ said Frodo, ‘and better give letter once, explain never sent it. That’s came tell me, I suppose, though you’ve taken long time come point.’ Poor Mr. Butterbur looked troubled. ‘You’re right, master,’ said, ‘and I beg pardon. And I’m mortal afraid Gandalf say, harm comes it. But I didn’t keep back a-purpose. I put safe. Then I couldn’t find nobody willing go Shire next day, day after, none folk spare; one thing another drove mind. I’m busy man. I’ll I set matters right, there’s help I give, you’ve name it. ‘Leaving letter aside, I promised Gandalf less. Barley, says me, friend mine Shire, may coming way long, another. He’ll calling Underhill. Mind that! But need ask questions. And I’m him, may trouble, may need help. Do whatever him, I’ll grateful, says. And are, trouble far off, seemingly.’ ‘What mean?’ asked Frodo. ‘These black men,’ said landlord lowering voice. ‘They’re looking Baggins, mean well, I’m hobbit. It Monday, dogs yammering geese screaming. Uncanny, I called it. Nob, came told two black men door asking hobbit called Baggins. Nob’s hair stood end. I bid black fellows off, slammed door them; they’ve asking question way Archet, I hear. And Ranger, Strider, he’s asking questions, too. Tried get see you, you’d bite sup, did.’ ‘He did!’ said Strider suddenly, coming forward light. ‘And much trouble would saved, let in, Barliman.’ The landlord jumped surprise. ‘You!’ cried. ‘You’re always popping up. What want now?’ ‘He’s leave,’ said Frodo. ‘He came offer help.’ ‘Well, know business, maybe,’ said Mr. Butterbur, looking suspiciously Strider. ‘But I plight, I wouldn’t take Ranger.’ ‘Then would take with?’ asked Strider. ‘A fat innkeeper remembers name people shout day? They cannot stay The Pony ever, cannot go home. They long road them. Will go keep black men off?’ ‘Me? Leave Bree! I wouldn’t money,’ said Mr. Butterbur, looking really scared. ‘But can’t stay quiet bit, Mr. Underhill? What queer goings on? What black men after, come from, I’d like know?’ ‘I’m sorry I can’t explain all,’ answered Frodo. ‘I tired worried, it’s long tale. But mean help me, I ought warn danger long I house. These Black Riders: I sure, I think, I fear come from——’ ‘They come Mordor,’ said Strider low voice. ‘From Mordor, Barliman, means anything you.’ ‘Save us!’ cried Mr. Butterbur turning pale; name evidently known him. ‘That worst news come Bree time.’ ‘It is,’ said Frodo. ‘Are still willing help me?’ ‘I am,’ said Mr. Butterbur. ‘More ever. Though I don’t know likes against, against——’ faltered. ‘Against Shadow East,’ said Strider quietly. ‘Not much, Barliman, every little helps. You let Mr. Underhill stay tonight, Mr. Underhill; forget name Baggins, till far away.’ ‘I’ll that,’ said Butterbur. ‘But they’ll find he’s without help me, I’m afraid. It’s pity Mr. Baggins drew attention evening, say more. The story Mr. Bilbo’s going heard tonight Bree. Even Nob guessing slow pate; others Bree quicker uptake is.’ ‘Well, hope Riders won’t come back yet,’ said Frodo. ‘I hope not, indeed,’ said Butterbur. ‘But spooks spooks, won’t get The Pony easy. Don’t worry till morning. Nob’ll say word. No black man shall pass doors, I stand legs. Me folk’ll keep watch tonight; best get sleep, can.’ ‘In case must called dawn,’ said Frodo. ‘We must get offas early possible. Breakfastat six-thirty, please.’ ‘Right! I’ll see orders,’ said landlord. ‘Good night, Mr. Baggins – Underhill, I say! Good night – now, bless me! Where’s Mr. Brandybuck?’ ‘I don’t know,’ said Frodo sudden anxiety. They forgotten Merry, getting late. ‘I afraid out. He said something going breath air.’ ‘Well, want looking mistake: party might holiday!’ said Butterbur. ‘I must go bar doors quick, I’ll see friend let comes. I’d better send Nob look him. Good night all!’ At last Mr. Butterbur went out, another doubtful look Strider shake head. His footsteps retreated passage. ‘Well?’saidStrider.‘Whenareyougoingtoopenthatletter?’ Frodolooked carefully seal broke it. It seemed certainly Gandalf’s. Inside, written wizard’s strong graceful script, following message: THE PRANCING PONY, BREE. Midyear’s Day, Shire Year, 1418. Dear Frodo, Bad news reached here. I must go once. You better leave Bag End soon, get Shire end July latest. I return soon I can; I follow you, I find gone. Leave message here, pass Bree. You trust landlord (Butterbur). You may meet friend mine Road: Man, lean, dark, tall, called Strider. He knows business help you. Make Rivendell. There I hope may meet again. If I come, Elrond advise you. Yours haste GANDALF. PS. Do NOT use It again, reason whatever! Do travel night! PPS. Make sure real Strider. There many strange men roads. His true name Aragorn. All gold glitter, Not wander lost; The old strong wither, Deep roots reached frost. From ashes fire shall woken, A light shadows shall spring; Renewed shall blade broken, The crownless shall king. PPPS. I hope Butterbur sends promptly. A worthy man, memory like lumberroom: thing wanted always buried. If forgets, I shall roast him. Fare Well! Frodo read letter himself, passed Pippin Sam. ‘Really old Butterbur made mess things!’ said. ‘He deserves roasting. If I got once, might safe Rivendell now. But happened Gandalf? He writes going great danger.’ ‘He many years,’ said Strider. Frodo turned looked thoughtfully, wondering Gandalf’s second postscript. ‘Why didn’t tell Gandalf’s friend once?’ asked. ‘It would saved time.’ ‘Would it? Would believed till now?’ said Strider. ‘I knew nothing letter. For I knew I persuade trust without proofs, I help you. In case, I intend tell once. I study first, make sure you. The Enemy set traps now. As soon I made mind, I ready tell whatever asked. But I must admit,’ added queer laugh, ‘that I hoped would take sake. A hunted man sometimes wearies distrust longs friendship. But there, I believe looks me.’ ‘They – first sight rate,’ laughed Pippin sudden relief reading Gandalf’s letter. ‘But handsome handsome does, say Shire; I daresay shall look much lying days hedges ditches.’ ‘It would take days, weeks, years, wandering Wild make look like Strider,’ answered. ‘And would die first, unless made sterner stuff look be.’ Pippin subsided; Sam daunted, still eyed Strider dubiously. ‘How know Strider Gandalf speaks about?’ demanded. ‘You never mentioned Gandalf, till letter came out. You might play-acting spy, I see, trying get us go you. You might done real Strider took clothes. What say that?’ ‘That stout fellow,’ answered Strider; ‘but I afraid answer you, Sam Gamgee, this. If I killed real Strider, I could kill you. And I killed already without much talk. If I Ring, I could – now!’ He stood up, seemed suddenly grow taller. In eyes gleamed light, keen commanding. Throwing back cloak, laid hand hilt sword hung concealed side. They dare move. Sam sat wide-mouthed staring dumbly. ‘But I real Strider, fortunately,’ said, looking face softened sudden smile. ‘I Aragorn son Arathorn; life death I save you, I will.’ There long silence. At last Frodo spoke hesitation. ‘I believed friend letter came,’ said, ‘or least I wished to. You frightened several times tonight, never way servants Enemy would, I imagine. I think one spies would – well, seem fairer feel fouler, understand.’ ‘I see,’ laughed Strider. ‘I look foul feel fair. Is it? All gold glitter, wander lost.’ ‘Did verses apply then?’ asked Frodo. ‘I could make about. But know Gandalf’s letter, never seen it?’ ‘I know,’ answered. ‘But I Aragorn, verses go name.’ He drew sword, saw blade indeed broken foot hilt. ‘Not much use it, Sam?’ said Strider. ‘But time near shall forged anew.’ Sam said nothing. ‘Well,’ said Strider, ‘with Sam’s permission call settled. Strider shall guide. And I think time went bed took rest can. We shall rough road tomorrow. Even allowed leave Bree unhindered, hardly hope leave unnoticed. But I shall try get lost soon possible. I know one two ways Bree-land main road. If shake pursuit, I shall make Weathertop.’ ‘Weathertop?’ said Sam. ‘What’s that?’ ‘It hill, north Road, half way Rivendell. It commands wide view round; shall chance look us. Gandalf make point, follows us. After Weathertop journey become difficult, shall choose various dangers.’ ‘When last see Gandalf?’ asked Frodo. ‘Do know is, doing?’ Strider looked grave. ‘I know,’ said. ‘I came west spring. I often kept watch borders Shire last years, busy elsewhere. He seldom left unguarded. We last met first May: Sarn Ford Brandywine. He told business gone well, would starting Rivendell last week September. As I knew side, I went away journey own. And proved ill; plainly news reached him, I hand help. ‘I troubled, first time since I known him. We messages, even could come himself. When I returned, many days ago, I heard ill news. The tidings gone far wide Gandalf missing horsemen seen. It Elven-folk Gildor told this; later told left home; news leaving Buckland. I watching East Road anxiously.’ ‘Do think Black Riders anything – Gandalf’s absence, I mean?’ asked Frodo. ‘I know anything else could hindered him, except Enemy himself,’ said Strider. ‘But give hope! Gandalf greater Shire-folk know – rule see jokes toys. But business greatest task.’ Pippin yawned. ‘I sorry,’ said, ‘but I dead tired. In spite danger worry I must go bed, sleep I sit. Where silly fellow, Merry? It would last straw, go dark look him.’ At moment heard door slam; feet came running along passage. Merry came rush followed Nob. He shut door hastily, leaned it. He breath. They stared alarm moment gasped: ‘I seen them, Frodo! I seen them! Black Riders!’ ‘Black Riders!’ cried Frodo. ‘Where?’ ‘Here. In village. I stayed indoors hour. Then come back, I went stroll. I come back standing outside light lamp looking stars. Suddenly I shivered felt something horrible creeping near: sort deeper shade among shadows across road, beyond edge lamplight. It slid away dark without sound. There horse.’ ‘Which way go?’ asked Strider, suddenly sharply. Merry started, noticing stranger first time. ‘Go on!’ said Frodo. ‘This friend Gandalf’s. I explain later.’ ‘It seemed make Road, eastward,’ continued Merry. ‘I tried follow. Of course, vanished almost once; I went round corner far last house Road.’ Strider looked Merry wonder. ‘You stout heart,’ said; ‘but foolish.’ ‘I don’t know,’ said Merry. ‘Neither brave silly, I think. I could hardly help myself. I seemed drawn somehow. Anyway, I went, suddenly I heard voices hedge. One muttering; whispering, hissing. I couldn’t hear word said. I creep closer, I began tremble over. Then I felt terrified, I turned back, going bolt home, something came behind I . . . I fell over.’ ‘I found him, sir,’ put Nob. ‘Mr. Butterbur sent lantern. I went West-gate, back towards South-gate. Just nigh Bill Ferny’s house I thought I could see something Road. I couldn’t swear it, looked two men stooping something, lifting it. I gave shout, I got spot signs them, Mr. Brandybuck lying roadside. He seemed asleep. ‘‘I thought I fallen deep water,’’ says me, I shook him. Very queer was, soon I roused him, got ran back like hare.’ ‘I afraid that’s true,’ said Merry, ‘though I don’t know I said. I ugly dream, I can’t remember. I went pieces. I don’t know came me.’ ‘I do,’ said Strider. ‘The Black Breath. The Riders must left horses outside, passed back South-gate secret. They know news now, visited Bill Ferny; probably Southerner spy well. Something may happen night, leave Bree.’ ‘What happen?’ said Merry. ‘Will attack inn?’ ‘No, I think not,’ said Strider. ‘They yet. And case way. In dark loneliness strongest; openly attack house lights many people – desperate, long leagues Eriador still lie us. But power terror, already Bree clutch. They drive wretches evil work: Ferny, strangers, and, maybe, gatekeeper too. They words Harry West-gate Monday. I watching them. He white shaking left him.’ ‘We seem enemies round,’ said Frodo. ‘What do?’ ‘Stay here, go rooms! They sure found are. The hobbit-rooms windows looking north close ground. We remain together bar window door. But first Nob I fetch luggage.’ While Strider gone, Frodo gave Merry rapid account happened since supper. Merry still reading pondering Gandalf’s letter Strider Nob returned. ‘Well Masters,’ said Nob, ‘I’ve ruffled clothes put bolster middle bed. And I made nice imitation head brown woollen mat, Mr. Bag – Underhill, sir,’ added grin. Pippin laughed. ‘Very life-like!’ said. ‘But happen penetrated disguise?’ ‘We shall see,’ said Strider. ‘Let us hope hold fort till morning.’ ‘Good night you,’ said Nob, went take part watch doors. Their bags gear piled parlour-floor. They pushed low chair door shut window. Peering out, Frodo saw night still clear. The Sickle* swinging bright shoulders Bree-hill. He closed barred heavy inside shutters drew curtains together. Strider built fire blew candles. The hobbits lay blankets feet towards hearth; Strider settled chair door. They talked little, Merry still several questions ask. ‘Jumped Moon!’ chuckled Merry rolled blanket. ‘Very ridiculous you, Frodo! But I wish * The Hobbits’ name Plough Great Bear. I see. The worthies Bree discussing hundred years hence.’ ‘I hope so,’ said Strider. Then fell silent, one one hobbits dropped sleep. Chapter 11 A KNIFE IN THE DARK As prepared sleep inn Bree, darkness lay Buckland; mist strayed dells along river-bank. The house Crickhollow stood silent. Fatty Bolger opened door cautiously peered out. A feeling fear growing day, unable rest go bed: brooding threat breathless night-air. As stared gloom, black shadow moved trees; gate seemed open accord close without sound. Terror seized him. He shrank back, moment stood trembling hall. Then shut locked door. The night deepened. There came soft sound horses led stealth along lane. Outside gate stopped, three black figures entered, like shades night creeping across ground. One went door, one corner house either side; stood, still shadows stones, night went slowly on. The house quiet trees seemed waiting breathlessly. There faint stir leaves, cock crowed far away. The cold hour dawn passing. The figure door moved. In dark without moon stars drawn blade gleamed, chill light unsheathed. There blow, soft heavy, door shuddered. ‘Open, name Mordor!’ said voice thin menacing. At second blow door yielded fell back, timbers burst lock broken. The black figures passed swiftly in. At moment, among trees nearby, horn rang out. It rent night like fire hill-top. awake! fear! fire! foes! awake! Fatty Bolger idle. As soon saw dark shapes creep garden, knew must run it, perish. And run did, back door, garden, fields. When reached nearest house, mile away, collapsed doorstep. ‘No, no, no!’ crying. ‘No, me! I haven’t got it!’ It time anyone could make babbling about. At last got idea enemies Buckland, strange invasion Old Forest. And lost time. fear! fire! foes! The Brandybucks blowing Horn-call Buckland, sounded hundred years, since white wolves came Fell Winter, Brandywine frozen over. awake! awake! Far away answering horns heard. The alarm spreading. The black figures fled house. One let fall hobbit-cloak step, ran. In lane noise hoofs broke out, gathering gallop, went hammering away darkness. All Crickhollow sound horns blowing, voices crying feet running. But Black Riders rode like gale North-gate. Let little people blow! Sauron would deal later. Meanwhile another errand: knew house empty Ring gone. They rode guards gate vanished Shire. * * * In early night Frodo woke deep sleep, suddenly, sound presence disturbed him. He saw Strider sitting alert chair: eyes gleamed light fire, tended burning brightly; made sign movement. Frodo soon went sleep again; dreams troubled noise wind galloping hoofs. The wind seemed curling round house shaking it; far heard horn blowing wildly. He opened eyes, heard cock crowing lustily inn-yard. Strider drawn curtains pushed back shutters clang. The first grey light day room, cold air coming open window. As soon Strider roused all, led way bedrooms. When saw glad taken advice: windows forced open swinging, curtains flapping; beds tossed about, bolsters slashed flung upon floor; brown mat torn pieces. Strider immediately went fetch landlord. Poor Mr. Butterbur looked sleepy frightened. He hardly closed eyes night (so said), never heard sound. ‘Never thing happened time!’ cried, raising hands horror. ‘Guests unable sleep beds, good bolsters ruined all! What coming to?’ ‘Dark times,’ said Strider. ‘But present may left peace, got rid us. We leave once. Never mind breakfast: drink bite standing do. We shall packed minutes.’ Mr. Butterbur hurried see ponies got ready, fetch ‘bite’. But soon came back dismay. The ponies vanished! The stable-doors opened night, gone: Merry’s ponies, every horse beast place. Frodo crushed news. How could hope reach Rivendell foot, pursued mounted enemies? They might well set Moon. Strider sat silent while, looking hobbits, weighing strength courage. ‘Ponies would help us escape horsemen,’ said last, thoughtfully, guessed Frodo mind. ‘We go much slower foot, roads I mean take. I going walk case. It food stores trouble me. We cannot count getting anything eat Rivendell, except take us; ought take plenty spare; may delayed, forced go round-about, far direct way. How much prepared carry backs?’ ‘As much must,’ said Pippin sinking heart, trying show tougher looked (or felt). ‘I carry enough two,’ said Sam defiantly. ‘Can’t anything done, Mr. Butterbur?’ asked Frodo. ‘Can’t get couple ponies village, even one baggage? I don’t suppose could hire them, might able buy them,’ added, doubtfully, wondering could afford it. ‘I doubt it,’ said landlord unhappily. ‘The two three riding-ponies Bree stabled yard, they’re gone. As animals, horses ponies draught not, Bree, won’t sale. But I’ll I can. I’ll rout Bob send round soon may be.’ ‘Yes,’ said Strider reluctantly, ‘you better that. I afraid shall try get one pony least. But ends hope starting early, slipping away quietly! We might well blown horn announce departure. That part plan, doubt.’ ‘There one crumb comfort,’ said Merry, ‘and crumb, I hope: breakfast wait – sit it. Let’s get hold Nob!’ * * * In end three hours’ delay. Bob came back report horse pony got love money neighbourhood – except one: Bill Ferny one might possibly sell. ‘A poor old half-starved creature is,’ said Bob; ‘but won’t part less thrice worth, seeing you’re placed, I knows Bill Ferny.’ ‘Bill Ferny?’ said Frodo. ‘Isn’t trick? Wouldn’t beast bolt back stuff, help tracking us, something?’ ‘I wonder,’ said Strider. ‘But I cannot imagine animal running home him, got away. I fancy afterthought kind Master Ferny’s: way increasing profits affair. The chief danger poor beast probably death’s door. But seem choice. What want it?’ Bill Ferny’s price twelve silver pennies; indeed least three times pony’s value parts. It proved bony, underfed, dispirited animal; look like dying yet. Mr. Butterbur paid himself, offered Merry another eighteen pence compensation lost animals. He honest man, well-off things reckoned Bree; thirty silver pennies sore blow him, cheated Bill Ferny made harder bear. As matter fact came right side end. It turned later one horse actually stolen. The others driven off, bolted terror, found wandering different corners Bree-land. Merry’s ponies escaped altogether, eventually (having good deal sense) made way Downs search Fatty Lumpkin. So came care Tom Bombadil while, welloff. But news events Bree came Tom’s ears, sent Mr. Butterbur, thus got five good beasts fair price. They work harder Bree, Bob treated well; whole lucky: missed dark dangerous journey. But never came Rivendell. However, meanwhile Mr. Butterbur knew money gone good, bad. And troubles. For great commotion soon remaining guests astir heard news raid inn. The southern travellers lost several horses blamed innkeeper loudly, became known one number also disappeared night, none Bill Ferny’s squint-eyed companion. Suspicion fell once. ‘If pick horse-thief, bring house,’ said Butterbur angrily, ‘you ought pay damage come shouting me. Go ask Ferny handsome friend is!’ But appeared nobody’s friend, nobody could recollect joined party. After breakfast hobbits re-pack, get together supplies longer journey expecting. It close ten o’clock last got off. By time whole Bree buzzing excitement. Frodo’s vanishing trick; appearance black horsemen; robbing stables; least news Strider Ranger joined mysterious hobbits, made tale would last many uneventful years. Most inhabitants Bree Staddle, many even Combe Archet, crowded road see travellers start. The guests inn doors hanging windows. Strider changed mind, decided leave Bree main road. Any attempt set across country would make matters worse: half inhabitants would follow them, see to, prevent trespassing. They said farewell Nob Bob, took leave Mr. Butterbur many thanks. ‘I hope shall meet day, things merry more,’ said Frodo. ‘I like nothing better stay house peace while.’ They tramped off, anxious downhearted, eyes crowd. Not faces friendly, words shouted. But Strider seemed held awe Bree-landers, stared shut mouths drew away. He walked front Frodo; next came Merry Pippin; last came Sam leading pony, laden much baggage heart give it; already looked less dejected, approved change fortunes. Sam chewing apple thoughtfully. He pocket full them: parting present Nob Bob. ‘Apples walking, pipe sitting,’ said. ‘But I reckon I’ll miss long.’ The hobbits took notice inquisitive heads peeped doors, popped walls fences, passed. But drew near gate, Frodo saw dark ill-kept house behind thick hedge: last house village. In one windows caught glimpse sallow face sly, slanting eyes; vanished once. ‘So that’s southerner hiding!’ thought. ‘He looks half like goblin.’ Over hedge another man staring boldly. He heavy black brows, dark scornful eyes; large mouth curled sneer. He smoking short black pipe. As approached took mouth spat. ‘Morning, Longshanks!’ said. ‘Off early? Found friends last?’ Strider nodded, answer. ‘Morning, little friends!’ said others. ‘I suppose know you’ve taken with? That’s Stick-atnaught Strider, is! Though I’ve heard names pretty. Watch tonight! And you, Sammie, don’t go ill-treating poor old pony! Pah!’ He spat again. Sam turned quickly. ‘And you, Ferny,’ said, ‘put ugly face sight, get hurt.’ With sudden flick, quick lightning, apple left hand hit Bill square nose. He ducked late, curses came behind hedge. ‘Waste good apple,’ said Sam regretfully, strode on. At last left village behind. The escort children stragglers followed got tired turned back South-gate. Passing through, kept along Road miles. It bent left, curving back eastward line rounded feet Bree-hill, began run swiftly downwards wooded country. To left could see houses hobbit-holes Staddle gentler south-eastern slopes hill; deep hollow away north Road wisps rising smoke showed Combe lay; Archet hidden trees beyond. After Road run way, left Bree-hill standing tall brown behind, came narrow track led towards North. ‘This leave open take cover,’ said Strider. ‘Not ‘‘short cut’’, I hope,’ said Pippin. ‘Our last short cut woods nearly ended disaster.’ ‘Ah, got then,’ laughed Strider. ‘My cuts, short long, don’t go wrong.’ He took look Road. No one sight; led way quickly towards wooded valley. His plan, far could understand without knowing country, go towards Archet first, bear right pass east, steer straight could wild lands Weathertop Hill. In way would, went well, cut great loop Road, bent southwards avoid Midgewater Marshes. But, course, would pass marshes themselves, Strider’s description encouraging. However, meanwhile, walking unpleasant. Indeed, disturbing events night before, would enjoyed part journey better time. The sun shining, clear hot. The woods valley still leafy full colour, seemed peaceful wholesome. Strider guided confidently among many crossing paths, although left would soon loss. He taking wandering course many turns doublings, put pursuit. ‘Bill Ferny watched left Road, certain,’ said; ‘though I don’t think follow us himself. He knows land round well enough, knows match wood. It may tell others I afraid of. I don’t suppose far away. If think made Archet, much better.’ Whether Strider’s skill reason, saw sign heard sound living thing day: neither two-footed, except birds; four-footed, except one fox squirrels. The next day began steer steady course eastwards; still quiet peaceful. On third day Bree came Chetwood. The land falling steadily, ever since turned aside Road, entered wide flat expanseofcountry,muchmoredifficulttomanage.Theywere far beyond borders Bree-land, pathless wilderness, drawing near Midgewater Marshes. The ground became damp, places boggy came upon pools, wide stretches reeds rushes filled warbling little hidden birds. They pick way carefully keep dry-footed proper course. At first made fair progress, went on, passage became slower dangerous. The marshes bewildering treacherous, permanent trail even Rangers find shifting quagmires. The flies began torment them, air full clouds tiny midges crept sleeves breeches hair. ‘I eaten alive!’ cried Pippin. ‘Midgewater! There midges water!’ ‘What live can’t get hobbit?’ asked Sam, scratching neck. They spent miserable day lonely unpleasant country. Their camping-place damp, cold, uncomfortable; biting insects would let sleep. There also abominable creatures haunting reeds tussocks sound evil relatives cricket. There thousands them, squeaked round, neek-breek, breek-neek, unceasingly night, hobbits nearly frantic. The next day, fourth, little better, night almost comfortless. Though Neekerbreekers (as Sam called them) left behind, midges still pursued them. As Frodo lay, tired unable close eyes, seemed far away came light eastern sky: flashed faded many times. It dawn, still hours off. ‘What light?’ said Strider, risen, standing, gazing ahead night. ‘I know,’ Strider answered. ‘It distant make out. It like lightning leaps hill-tops.’ Frodo lay again, long could still see white flashes, tall dark figure Strider, standing silent watchful. At last passed uneasy sleep. They gone far fifth day left last straggling pools reed-beds marshes behind them. The land began steadily rise again. Away distance eastward could see line hills. The highest right line little separated others. It conical top, slightly flattened summit. ‘That Weathertop,’ said Strider. ‘The Old Road, left far away right, runs south passes far foot. We might reach noon tomorrow, go straight towards it. I suppose better so.’ ‘What mean?’ asked Frodo. ‘I mean: get there, certain shall find. It close Road.’ ‘But surely hoping find Gandalf there?’ ‘Yes; hope faint. If comes way all, may pass Bree, may know doing. And anyway, unless luck arrive almost together, shall miss one another; safe us wait long. If Riders fail find us wilderness, likely make Weathertop themselves. It commands wide view round. Indeed, many birds beasts country could see us, stand here, hill-top. Not birds trusted, spies evil are.’ The hobbits looked anxiously distant hills. Sam looked pale sky, fearing see hawks eagles hovering bright unfriendly eyes. ‘You make feel uncomfortable lonesome, Strider!’ said. ‘What advise us do?’ asked Frodo. ‘I think,’ answered Strider slowly, quite sure, ‘I think best thing go straight eastward can, make line hills, Weathertop. There strike path I know runs feet; bring us Weathertop north less openly. Then shall see shall see.’ All day plodded along, cold early evening came down. The land became drier barren; mists vapours lay behind marshes. A melancholy birds piping wailing, round red sun sank slowly western shadows; empty silence fell. The hobbits thought soft light sunset glancing cheerful windows Bag End far away. At day’s end came stream wandered hills lose stagnant marshland, went along banks light lasted. It already night last halted made camp stunted alder-trees shores stream. Ahead loomed dusky sky bleak treeless backs hills. That night set watch, Strider, seemed, sleep all. The moon waxing, early night-hours cold grey light lay land. Next morning set soon sunrise. There frost air, sky pale clear blue. The hobbits felt refreshed, night unbroken sleep. Already getting used much walking short commons – shorter rate Shire would thought barely enough keep legs. Pippin declared Frodo looking twice hobbit been. ‘Very odd,’ said Frodo, tightening belt, ‘considering actually good deal less me. I hope thinning process go indefinitely, I shall become wraith.’ ‘Do speak things!’ said Strider quickly, surprising earnestness. The hills drew nearer. They made undulating ridge, often rising almost thousand feet, falling low clefts passes leading eastern land beyond. Along crest ridge hobbits could see looked remains green-grown walls dikes, clefts still stood ruins old works stone. By night reached feet westward slopes, camped. It night fifth October, six days Bree. In morning found, first time since left Chetwood, track plain see. They turned right followed southwards. It ran cunningly, taking line seemed chosen keep much hidden possible view, hill-tops flats west. It dived dells, hugged steep banks; passed flatter open ground either side lines large boulders hewn stones screened travellers almost like hedge. ‘I wonder made path, for,’ said Merry, walked along one avenues, stones unusually large closely set. ‘I sure I like it: – well, rather barrow-wightish look. Is barrow Weathertop?’ ‘No. There barrow Weathertop, hills,’ answered Strider. ‘The Men West live here; though latter days defended hills evil came Angmar. This path made serve forts along walls. But long before, first days North Kingdom, built great watch-tower Weathertop, Amon Suˆl called it. It burned broken, nothing remains tumbled ring, like rough crown old hill’s head. Yet tall fair. It told Elendil stood watching coming Gil-galad West, days Last Alliance.’ The hobbits gazed Strider. It seemed learned old lore, well ways wild. ‘Who Gil-galad?’ asked Merry; Strider answer, seemed lost thought. Suddenly low voice murmured: Gil-galad Elven-king. Of harpers sadly sing: last whose realm fair free Mountains Sea. His sword long, lance keen, shining helm afar seen; countless stars heaven’s field mirrored silver shield. But long ago rode away, dwelleth none say; darkness fell star Mordor shadows are. The others turned amazement, voice Sam’s. ‘Don’t stop!’ said Merry. ‘That’s I know,’ stammered Sam, blushing. ‘I learned Mr. Bilbo I lad. He used tell tales like that, knowing I always one hearing Elves. It Mr. Bilbo taught letters. He mighty book-learned dear old Mr. Bilbo. And wrote poetry. He wrote I said.’ ‘He make up,’ said Strider. ‘It part lay called The Fall Gil-galad, ancient tongue. Bilbo must translated it. I never knew that.’ ‘There lot more,’ said Sam, ‘all Mordor. I didn’t learn part, gave shivers. I never thought I going way myself!’ ‘Going Mordor!’ cried Pippin. ‘I hope won’t come that!’ ‘Do speak name loudly!’ said Strider. It already mid-day drew near southern end path, saw them, pale clear light October sun, grey-green bank, leading like bridge northward slope hill. They decided make top once, daylight broad. Concealment longer possible, could hope enemy spy observing them. Nothing seen moving hill. If Gandalf anywhere about, sign him. On western flank Weathertop found sheltered hollow, bottom bowl-shaped dell grassy sides. There left Sam Pippin pony packs luggage. The three went on. After half hour’s plodding climb Strider reached crown hill; Frodo Merry followed, tired breathless. The last slope steep rocky. On top found, Strider said, wide ring ancient stone-work, crumbling covered age-long grass. But centre cairn broken stones piled. They blackened fire. About turf burned roots within ring grass scorched shrivelled, flames swept hilltop; sign living thing. Standing upon rim ruined circle, saw round wide prospect, part lands empty featureless, except patches woodland away south, beyond caught glint distant water. Beneath southern side ran like ribbon Old Road, coming West winding down, faded behind ridge dark land east. Nothing moving it. Following line eastward eyes saw Mountains: nearer foothills brown sombre; behind stood taller shapes grey, behind high white peaks glimmering among clouds. ‘Well, are!’ said Merry. ‘And cheerless uninviting looks! There water shelter. And sign Gandalf. But I don’t blame waiting – ever came here.’ ‘I wonder,’ said Strider, looking round thoughtfully. ‘Even day two behind us Bree, could arrived first. He ride swiftly need presses.’ Suddenly stooped looked stone top cairn; flatter others, whiter, escaped fire. He picked examined it, turning fingers. ‘This handled recently,’ said. ‘What think marks?’ On flat under-side Frodo saw scratches: . ‘There seems stroke, dot, three strokes,’ said. ‘The stroke left might G-rune thin branches,’ said Strider. ‘It might sign left Gandalf, though one cannot sure. The scratches fine, certainly look fresh. But marks might mean something quite different, nothing us. Rangers use runes, come sometimes.’ ‘What could mean, even Gandalf made them?’ asked Merry. ‘I say,’ answered Strider, ‘that stood G3, sign Gandalf October third: three days ago now. It would also show hurry danger hand, time dare write anything longer plainer. If so, must wary.’ ‘I wish could feel sure made marks, whatever may mean,’ said Frodo. ‘It would great comfort know way, front us behind us.’ ‘Perhaps,’ said Strider. ‘For myself, I believe here, danger. There scorching flames here; light saw three nights ago eastern sky comes back mind. I guess attacked hill-top, result I cannot tell. He longer, must look make way Rivendell, best can.’ ‘How far Rivendell?’ asked Merry, gazing round wearily. The world looked wild wide Weathertop. ‘I don’t know Road ever measured miles beyond Forsaken Inn, day’s journey east Bree,’ answered Strider. ‘Some say far, say otherwise. It strange road, folk glad reach journey’s end, whether time long short. But I know long would take feet, fair weather ill fortune: twelve days Ford Bruinen, Road crosses Loudwater runs Rivendell. We least fortnight’s journey us, I think shall able use Road.’ ‘A fortnight!’ said Frodo. ‘A lot may happen time.’ ‘It may,’ said Strider. They stood silent hill-top, near southward edge. In lonely place Frodo first time fully realized homelessness danger. He wished bitterly fortune left quiet beloved Shire. He stared hateful Road, leading back westward – home. Suddenly aware two black specks moving slowly along it, going westward; looking saw three others creeping eastward meet them. He gave cry clutched Strider’s arm. ‘Look,’ said, pointing downwards. At Strider flung ground behind ruined circle, pulling Frodo beside him. Merry threw alongside. ‘What it?’ whispered. ‘I know, I fear worst,’ answered Strider. Slowly crawled edge ring again, peered cleft two jagged stones. The light longer bright, clear morning faded, clouds creeping East overtaken sun, began go down. They could see black specks, neither Frodo Merry could make shapes certain; yet something told there, far below, Black Riders assembling Road beyond foot hill. ‘Yes,’ said Strider, whose keener sight left doubt. ‘The enemy here!’ Hastily crept away slipped north side hill find companions. Sam Peregrin idle. They explored small dell surrounding slopes. Not far away found spring clear water hillside, near footprints day two old. In dell found recent traces fire, signs hasty camp. There fallen rocks edge dell nearest hill. Behind Sam came upon small store firewood neatly stacked. ‘I wonder old Gandalf here,’ said Pippin. ‘Whoever put stuff meant come back seems.’ Strider greatly interested discoveries. ‘I wish I waited explored ground myself,’ said, hurrying spring examine footprints. ‘It I feared,’ said, came back. ‘Sam Pippin trampled soft ground, marks spoilt confused. Rangers lately. It left firewood behind. But also several newer tracks made Rangers. At least one set made, day two ago, heavy boots. At least one. I cannot certain, I think many booted feet.’ He paused stood anxious thought. Each hobbits saw mind vision cloaked bootedRiders. Ifthe horsemenhad alreadyfound thedell, sooner Strider led somewhere else better. Sam viewed hollow great dislike, heard news enemies Road, miles away. ‘Hadn’t better clear quick, Mr. Strider?’ asked impatiently. ‘It getting late, I don’t like hole: makes heart sink somehow.’ ‘Yes, certainly must decide once,’ answered Strider, looking considering time weather. ‘Well, Sam,’ said last, ‘I like place either; I cannot think anywhere better could reach nightfall. At least sight moment, moved much likely seen spies. All could would go right way back north side line hills, land much here. The Road watched, cross it, tried take cover thickets away south. On north side Road beyond hills country bare flat miles.’ ‘Can Riders see?’ asked Merry. ‘I mean, seem usually used noses rather eyes, smelling us, smelling right word, least daylight. But made us lie flat saw below; talk seen, move.’ ‘I careless hill-top,’ answered Strider. ‘I anxious find sign Gandalf; mistake three us go stand long. For black horses see, Riders use men creatures spies, found Bree. They see world light do, shapes cast shadows minds, noon sun destroys; dark perceive many signs forms hidden us: feared. And times smell blood living things, desiring hating it. Senses, too, sight smell. We feel presence – troubled hearts, soon came here, saw them; feel keenly. Also,’ added, voice sank whisper, ‘the Ring draws them.’ ‘Is escape then?’ said Frodo, looking round wildly. ‘If I move I shall seen hunted! If I stay, I shall draw me!’ Strider laid hand shoulder. ‘There still hope,’ said. ‘You alone. Let us take wood set ready fire sign. There little shelter defence here, fire shall serve both. Sauron put fire evil uses, things, Riders love it, fear wield it. Fire friend wilderness.’ ‘Maybe,’ muttered Sam. ‘It also good way saying ‘‘here are’’ I think of, bar shouting.’ Down lowest sheltered corner dell lit fire, prepared meal. The shades evening began fall, grew cold. They suddenly aware great hunger, eaten anything since breakfast; dared make frugal supper. The lands ahead empty save birds beasts, unfriendly places deserted races world. Rangers passed times beyond hills, stay. Other wanderers rare, evil sort: trolls might stray times northern valleys Misty Mountains. Only Road would travellers found, often dwarves, hurrying along business own, help words spare strangers. ‘I don’t see food made last,’ said Frodo. ‘We careful enough last days, supper feast; used ought, two weeks still go, perhaps more.’ ‘There food wild,’ said Strider; ‘berry, root, herb; I skill hunter need. You need afraid starving winter comes. But gathering catching food long weary work, need haste. So tighten belts, think hope tables Elrond’s house!’ The cold increased darkness came on. Peering edge dell could see nothing grey land vanishing quickly shadow. The sky cleared slowly filled twinkling stars. Frodo companions huddled round fire, wrapped every garment blanket possessed; Strider content single cloak, sat little apart, drawing thoughtfully pipe. As night fell light fire began shine brightly began tell tales keep minds fear. He knew many histories legends long ago, Elves Men good evil deeds Elder Days. They wondered old was, learned lore. ‘Tell us Gil-galad,’ said Merry suddenly, paused end story Elf-kingdoms. ‘Do know old lay spoke of?’ ‘I indeed,’ answered Strider. ‘So also Frodo, concerns us closely.’ Merry Pippin looked Frodo, staring fire. ‘I know little Gandalf told me,’ said Frodo slowly. ‘Gil-galad last great Elf-kings Middle-earth. Gil-galad Starlight tongue. With Elendil, Elf-friend, went land of——’ ‘No!’ said Strider interrupting, ‘I think tale told servants Enemy hand. If win house Elrond, may hear there, told full.’ ‘Then tell us tale old days,’ begged Sam; ‘a tale Elves fading time. I would dearly like hear Elves; dark seems press round close.’ ‘I tell tale Tinu´viel,’ said Strider, ‘in brief – long tale end known; none now, except Elrond, remember aright told old. It fair tale, though sad, tales Middle-earth, yet may lift hearts.’ He silent time, began speak chant softly: The leaves long, grass green, The hemlock-umbels tall fair, And glade light seen Of stars shadow shimmering. Tinu´viel dancing To music pipe unseen, And light stars hair, And raiment glimmering. There Beren came mountains cold, And lost wandered leaves, And Elven-river rolled He walked alone sorrowing. He peered hemlock-leaves And saw wonder flowers gold Upon mantle sleeves, And hair like shadow following. Enchantment healed weary feet That hills doomed roam; And forth hastened, strong fleet, And grasped moonbeams glistening. Through woven woods Elvenhome She lightly fled dancing feet, And left lonely still roam In silent forest listening. He heard oft flying sound Of feet light linden-leaves, Or music welling underground, In hidden hollows quavering. Now withered lay hemlock-sheaves, And one one sighing sound Whispering fell beechen leaves In wintry woodland wavering. He sought ever, wandering far Where leaves years thickly strewn, By light moon ray star In frosty heavens shivering. Her mantle glinted moon, As hill-top high far She danced, feet strewn A mist silver quivering. When winter passed, came again, And song released sudden spring, Like rising lark, falling rain, And melting water bubbling. He saw elven-flowers spring About feet, healed He longed dance sing Upon grass untroubling. Again fled, swift came. Tinu´viel! Tinu´viel! He called Elvish name; And halted listening. One moment stood she, spell His voice laid her: Beren came, And doom fell Tinu´viel That arms lay glistening. As Beren looked eyes Within shadows hair, The trembling starlight skies He saw mirrored shimmering. Tinu´viel elven-fair, Immortal maiden elven-wise, About cast shadowy hair And arms like silver glimmering. Long way fate bore, O’er stony mountains cold grey, Through halls iron darkling door, And woods nightshade morrowless. The Sundering Seas lay, And yet last met more, And long ago passed away In forest singing sorrowless. Strider sighed paused spoke again. ‘That song,’ said, ‘in mode called ann-thennath among Elves, hard render Common Speech, rough echo it. It tells meeting Beren son Barahir Lu´thien Tinu´viel. Beren mortal man, Lu´thien daughter Thingol, King Elves upon Middle-earth world young; fairest maiden ever among children world. As stars mists Northern lands loveliness, face shining light. In days Great Enemy, Sauron Mordor servant, dwelt Angband North, Elves West coming back Middle-earth made war upon regain Silmarils stolen; fathers Men aided Elves. But Enemy victorious Barahir slain, Beren escaping great peril came Mountains Terror hidden Kingdom Thingol forest Neldoreth. There beheld Lu´thien singing dancing glade beside enchanted river Esgalduin; named Tinu´viel, Nightingale language old. Many sorrows befell afterwards, parted long. Tinu´viel rescued Beren dungeons Sauron, together passed great dangers, cast even Great Enemy throne, took iron crown one three Silmarils, brightest jewels, bride-price Lu´thien Thingol father. Yet last Beren slain Wolf came gates Angband, died arms Tinu´viel. But chose mortality, die world, might follow him; sung met beyond Sundering Seas, brief time walking alive green woods, together passed, long ago, beyond confines world. So Lu´thien Tinu´viel alone Elf-kindred died indeed left world, lost loved. But lineage Elf-lords old descended among Men. There live still Lu´thien foremother, said line shall never fail. Elrond Rivendell Kin. For Beren Lu´thien born Dior Thingol’s heir; Elwing White Ea¨rendil wedded, sailed ship mists world seas heaven Silmaril upon brow. And Ea¨rendil came Kings Nu´menor, Westernesse.’ As Strider speaking watched strange eager face, dimly lit red glow wood-fire. His eyes shone, voice rich deep. Above black starry sky. Suddenly pale light appeared crown Weathertop behind him. The waxing moon climbing slowly hill overshadowed them, stars hill-top faded. The story ended. The hobbits moved stretched. ‘Look!’ said Merry. ‘The Moon rising: must getting late.’ The others looked up. Even so, saw top hill something small dark glimmer moonrise. It perhaps large stone jutting rock shown pale light. Sam Merry got walked away fire. Frodo Pippin remained seated silence. Strider watching moonlight hill intently. All seemed quiet still, Frodo felt cold dread creeping heart, Strider longer speaking. He huddled closer fire. At moment Sam came running back edge dell. ‘I don’t know is,’ said, ‘but I suddenly felt afraid. I durstn’t go outside dell money; I felt something creeping slope.’ ‘Did see anything?’ asked Frodo, springing feet. ‘No, sir. I saw nothing, I didn’t stop look.’ ‘I saw something,’ said Merry; ‘or I thought I – away westwards moonlight falling flats beyond shadow hill-tops, I thought two three black shapes. They seemed moving way.’ ‘Keep close fire, faces outward!’ cried Strider. ‘Get longer sticks ready hands!’ For breathless time sat there, silent alert, backs turned wood-fire, gazing shadows encircled them. Nothing happened. There sound movement night. Frodo stirred, feeling must break silence: longed shout aloud. ‘Hush!’ whispered Strider. ‘What’s that?’ gasped Pippin moment. Over lip little dell, side away hill, felt, rather saw, shadow rise, one shadow one. They strained eyes, shadows seemed grow. Soon could doubt: three four tall black figures standing slope, looking them. So black seemed like black holes deep shade behind them. Frodo thought heard faint hiss venomous breath felt thin piercing chill. Then shapes slowly advanced. Terror overcame Pippin Merry, threw flat ground. Sam shrank Frodo’s side. Frodo hardly less terrified companions; quaking bitter cold, terror swallowed sudden temptation put Ring. The desire laid hold him, could think nothing else. He forget Barrow, message Gandalf; something seemed compelling disregard warnings, longed yield. Not hope escape, anything, either good bad: simply felt must take Ring put finger. He could speak. He felt Sam looking him, knew master great trouble, could turn towards him. He shut eyes struggled while; resistance became unbearable, last slowly drew chain, slipped Ring forefinger left hand. Immediately, though everything else remained before, dim dark, shapes became terribly clear. He able see beneath black wrappings. There five tall figures: two standing lip dell, three advancing. In white faces burned keen merciless eyes; mantles long grey robes; upon grey hairs helms silver; haggard hands swords steel. Their eyes fell pierced him, rushed towards him. Desperate, drew sword, seemed flickered red, firebrand. Two figures halted. The third taller others: hair long gleaming helm crown. In one hand held long sword, knife; knife hand held glowed pale light. He sprang forward bore Frodo. At moment Frodo threw forward ground, heard crying aloud: O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! At time struck feet enemy. A shrill cry rang night; felt pain like dart poisoned ice pierce left shoulder. Even swooned caught, swirling mist, glimpse Strider leaping darkness flaming brand wood either hand. With last effort Frodo, dropping sword, slipped Ring finger closed right hand tight upon it. Chapter 12 FLIGHT TO THE FORD When Frodo came still clutching Ring desperately. He lying fire, piled high burning brightly. His three companions bending him. ‘What happened? Where pale king?’ asked wildly. They overjoyed hear speak answer while; understand question. At length gathered Sam seen nothing vague shadowy shapes coming towards them. Suddenly horror Sam found master vanished; moment black shadow rushed past him, fell. He heard Frodo’s voice, seemed come great distance, earth, crying strange words. They saw nothing more, stumbled body Frodo, lying dead, face downwards grass sword beneath him. Strider ordered pick lay near fire, disappeared. That good ago. Sam plainly beginning doubts Strider; talking returned, appearing suddenly shadows. They started, Sam drew sword stood Frodo; Strider knelt swiftly side. ‘I Black Rider, Sam,’ said gently, ‘nor league them. I trying discover something movements; I found nothing. I cannot think gone attack again. But feeling presence anywhere hand.’ When heard Frodo tell, became full concern, shook head sighed. Then ordered Pippin Merry heat much water could small kettles, bathe wound it. ‘Keep fire going well, keep Frodo warm!’ said. Then got walked away, called Sam him. ‘I think I understand things better now,’ said low voice. ‘There seem five enemy. Why here, I don’t know; I don’t think expected resisted. They drawn time being. But far, I fear. They come another night, cannot escape. They waiting, think purpose almost accomplished, Ring cannot fly much further. I fear, Sam, believe master deadly wound subdue will. We shall see!’ Sam choked tears. ‘Don’t despair!’ said Strider. ‘You must trust now. Your Frodo made sterner stuff I guessed, though Gandalf hinted might prove so. He slain, I think resist evil power wound longer enemies expect. I I help heal him. Guard well, I away!’ He hurried disappeared darkness. Frodo dozed, though pain wound slowly growing, deadly chill spreading shoulder arm side. His friends watched him, warming him, bathing wound. The night passed slowly wearily. Dawn growing sky, dell filling grey light, Strider last returned. ‘Look!’ cried; stooping lifted ground black cloak lain hidden darkness. A foot lower hem slash. ‘This stroke Frodo’s sword,’ said. ‘The hurt enemy, I fear; unharmed, blades perish pierce dreadful King. More deadly name Elbereth.’ ‘And deadly Frodo this!’ He stooped lifted long thin knife. There cold gleam it. As Strider raised saw near end edge notched point broken off. But even held growing light, gazed astonishment, blade seemed melt, vanished like smoke air, leaving hilt Strider’s hand. ‘Alas!’ cried. ‘It accursed knife gave wound. Few skill healing match evil weapons. But I I can.’ He sat ground, taking dagger-hilt laid knees, sang slow song strange tongue. Then setting aside, turned Frodo soft tone spoke words others could catch. From pouch belt drew long leaves plant. ‘These leaves,’ said, ‘I walked far find; plant grow bare hills; thickets away south Road I found dark scent leaves.’ He crushed leaf fingers, gave sweet pungent fragrance. ‘It fortunate I could find it, healing plant Men West brought Middle-earth. Athelas named it, grows sparsely near places dwelt camped old; known North, except wander Wild. It great virtues, wound healing powers may small.’ He threw leaves boiling water bathed Frodo’s shoulder. The fragrance steam refreshing, unhurt felt minds calmed cleared. The herb also power wound, Frodo felt pain also sense frozen cold lessen side; life return arm, could raise use hand. He bitterly regretted foolishness, reproached weakness will; perceived putting Ring obeyed desire commanding wish enemies. He wondered would remain maimed life, would manage continue journey. He felt weak stand. The others discussing question. They quickly decided leave Weathertop soon possible. ‘I think now,’ said Strider, ‘that enemy watching place days. If Gandalf ever came here, must forced ride away, return. In case great peril dark, since attack last night, hardly meet greater danger wherever go.’ As soon daylight full, hurried food packed. It impossible Frodo walk, divided greater part baggage among four them, put Frodo pony. In last days poor beast improved wonderfully; already seemed fatter stronger, begun show affection new masters, especially Sam. Bill Ferny’s treatment must hard journey wild seem much better former life. They started southerly direction. This would mean crossing Road, quickest way wooded country. And needed fuel; Strider said Frodo must kept warm, especially night, fire would protection all. It also plan shorten journey cutting across another great loop Road: east beyond Weathertop changed course took wide bend northwards. They made way slowly cautiously round south-western slopes hill, came little edge Road. There sign Riders. But even hurrying across heard far away two cries: cold voice calling cold voice answering. Trembling sprang forward, made thickets lay ahead. The land sloped away southwards, wild pathless; bushes stunted trees grew dense patches wide barren spaces between. The grass scanty, coarse, grey; leaves thickets faded falling. It cheerless land, journey slow gloomy. They spoke little trudged along. Frodo’s heart grieved watched walking beside heads down, backs bowed burdens. Even Strider seemed tired heavyhearted. Before first day’s march Frodo’s pain began grow again, speak long time. Four days passed, without ground scene changing much, except behind Weathertop slowly sank, distant mountains loomed little nearer. Yet since far cry seen heard sign enemy marked flight followed them. They dreaded dark hours, kept watch pairs night, expecting time see black shapes stalking grey night, dimly lit cloud-veiled moon; saw nothing, heard sound sigh withered leaves grass. Not feel sense present evil assailed attack dell. It seemed much hope Riders already lost trail again. Perhaps waiting make ambush narrow place? At end fifth day ground began rise slowly wide shallow valley descended. Strider turned course northeastwards, sixth day reached top long slow-climbing slope, saw far ahead huddle wooded hills. Away could see Road sweeping round feet hills; right grey river gleamed pale thin sunshine. In distance glimpsed yet another river stony valley half-veiled mist. ‘I afraid must go back Road while,’ said Strider. ‘We come River Hoarwell, Elves call Mitheithel. It flows Ettenmoors, troll-fells north Rivendell, joins Loudwater away South. Some call Greyflood that. It great water finds Sea. There way sources Ettenmoors, except Last Bridge Road crosses.’ ‘What river see far away there?’ asked Merry. ‘That Loudwater, Bruinen Rivendell,’ answered Strider. ‘The Road runs along edge hills many miles Bridge Ford Bruinen. But I yet thought shall cross water. One river time! We shall fortunate indeed find Last Bridge held us.’ Next day, early morning, came borders Road. Sam Strider went forward, found sign travellers riders. Here shadow hills rain. Strider judged fallen two days before, washed away footprints. No horseman passed since then, far could see. They hurried along speed could make, mile two saw Last Bridge ahead, bottom short steep slope. They dreaded see black figures waiting there, saw none. Strider made take cover thicket side Road, went forward explore. Before long came hurrying back. ‘I see sign enemy,’ said, ‘and I wonder much means. But I found something strange.’ He held hand, showed single pale-green jewel. ‘I found mud middle Bridge,’ said. ‘It beryl, elf-stone. Whether set there, let fall chance, I cannot say; brings hope me. I take sign may pass Bridge; beyond I dare keep Road, without clearer token.’ * * * At went again. They crossed Bridge safety, hearing sound water swirling three great arches. A mile came narrow ravine led away northwards steep lands left Road. Here Strider turned aside, soon lost sombre country dark trees winding among feet sullen hills. The hobbits glad leave cheerless lands perilous Road behind them; new country seemed threatening unfriendly. As went forward hills steadily rose. Here upon heights ridges caught glimpses ancient walls stone, ruins towers: ominous look. Frodo, walking, time gaze ahead think. He recalled Bilbo’s account journey threatening towers hills north Road, country near Trolls’ wood first serious adventure happened. Frodo guessed region, wondered chance would pass near spot. ‘Who lives land?’ asked. ‘And built towers? Is troll-country?’ ‘No!’ said Strider. ‘Trolls build. No one lives land. Men dwelt here, ages ago; none remain now. They became evil people, legends tell, fell shadow Angmar. But destroyed war brought North Kingdom end. But long ago hills forgotten them, though shadow still lies land.’ ‘Where learn tales, land empty forgetful?’ asked Peregrin. ‘The birds beasts tell tales sort.’ ‘The heirs Elendil forget things past,’ said Strider; ‘and many things I tell remembered Rivendell.’ ‘Have often Rivendell?’ said Frodo. ‘I have,’ said Strider. ‘I dwelt once, still I return I may. There heart is; fate sit peace, even fair house Elrond.’ The hills began shut in. The Road behind held way River Bruinen, hidden view. The travellers came long valley; narrow, deeply cloven, dark silent. Trees old twisted roots hung cliffs, piled behind mounting slopes pine-wood. The hobbits grew weary. They advanced slowly, pick way pathless country, encumbered fallen trees tumbled rocks. As long could avoided climbing Frodo’s sake, fact difficult find way narrow dales. They two days country weather turned wet. The wind began blow steadily West pour water distant seas dark heads hills fine drenching rain. By nightfall soaked, camp cheerless, could get fire burn. The next day hills rose still higher steeper them, forced turn away northwards course. Strider seemed getting anxious: nearly ten days Weathertop, stock provisions beginning run low. It went raining. That night camped stony shelf rock-wall behind them, shallow cave, mere scoop cliff. Frodo restless. The cold wet made wound painful ever, ache sense deadly chill took away sleep. He lay tossing turning listening fearfully stealthy night-noises: wind chinks rock, water dripping, crack, sudden rattling fall loosened stone. He felt black shapes advancing smother him; sat saw nothing back Strider sitting hunched up, smoking pipe, watching. He lay passed uneasy dream, walked grass garden Shire, seemed faint dim, less clear tall black shadows stood looking hedge. In morning woke find rain stopped. The clouds still thick, breaking, pale strips blue appeared them. The wind shifting again. They start early. Immediately cold comfortless breakfast Strider went alone, telling others remain shelter cliff, came back. He going climb up, could, get look lie land. When returned reassuring. ‘We come far north,’ said, ‘and must find way turn back southwards again. If keep going shall get Ettendales far north Rivendell. That troll-country, little known me. We could perhaps find way come round Rivendell north; would take long, I know way, food would last. So somehow must find Ford Bruinen.’ The rest day spent scrambling rocky ground. They found passage two hills led valley running south-east, direction wished take; towards end day found road barred ridge high land; dark edge sky broken many bare points like teeth blunted saw. They choice going back climbing it. They decided attempt climb, proved difficult. Before long Frodo obliged dismount struggle along foot. Even often despaired getting pony up, indeed finding path themselves, burdened were. The light nearly gone, exhausted, last reached top. They climbed narrow saddle two higher points, land fell steeply away again, short distance ahead. Frodo threw down, lay ground shivering. His left arm lifeless, side shoulder felt icy claws laid upon them. The trees rocks seemed shadowy dim. ‘We cannot go further,’ said Merry Strider. ‘I afraid much Frodo. I dreadfully anxious him. What do? Do think able cure Rivendell, ever get there?’ ‘We shall see,’ answered Strider. ‘There nothing I wilderness; chiefly wound I anxious press on. But I agree go tonight.’ ‘What matter master?’ asked Sam low voice, looking appealingly Strider. ‘His wound small, already closed. There’s nothing seen cold white mark shoulder.’ ‘Frodo touched weapons Enemy,’ said Strider, ‘and poison evil work beyond skill drive out. But give hope, Sam!’ Night cold high ridge. They lit small fire gnarled roots old pine, hung shallow pit: looked stone quarried there. They sat huddled together. The wind blew chill pass, heard tree-tops lower moaning sighing. Frodo lay half dream, imagining endless dark wings sweeping him, wings rode pursuers sought hollows hills. The morning dawned bright fair; air clean, light pale clear rain-washed sky. Their hearts encouraged, longed sun warm cold stiff limbs. As soon light, Strider took Merry went survey country height east pass. The sun risen shining brightly returned comforting news. They going less right direction. If went on, side ridge, would Mountains left. Some way ahead Strider caught glimpse Loudwater again, knew that, though hidden view, Road Ford far River lay side nearest them. ‘We must make Road again,’ said. ‘We cannot hope find path hills. Whatever danger may beset it, Road way Ford.’ As soon eaten set again. They climbed slowly southern side ridge; way much easier expected, slope far less steep side, long Frodo able ride again. Bill Ferny’s poor old pony developing unexpected talent picking path, sparing rider many jolts possible. The spirits party rose again. Even Frodo felt better morning light, every mist seemed obscure sight, passed hands eyes. Pippin little ahead others. Suddenly turned round called them. ‘There path here!’ cried. When came him, saw made mistake: clearly beginnings path, climbed many windings woods faded away hill-top behind. In places faint overgrown, choked fallen stones trees; one time seemed much used. It path made strong arms heavy feet. Here old trees cut broken down, large rocks cloven heaved aside make way. They followed track while, offered much easiest way down, went cautiously, anxiety increased came dark woods, path grew plainer broader. Suddenly coming belt fir-trees ran steeply slope, turned sharply left round corner rocky shoulder hill. When came corner looked round saw path ran level strip face low cliff overhung trees. In stony wall door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge. Outside door halted. There cave rock-chamber behind, gloom inside nothing could seen. Strider, Sam, Merry pushing strength managed open door little wider, Strider Merry went in. They go far, floor lay many old bones, nothing else seen near entrance except great empty jars broken pots. ‘Surely troll-hole, ever one!’ said Pippin. ‘Come out, two, let us get away. Now know made path – better get quick.’ ‘There need, I think,’ said Strider, coming out. ‘It certainly troll-hole, seems long forsaken. I don’t think need afraid. But let us go warily, shall see.’ The path went door, turning right across level space plunged thick wooded slope. Pippin, liking show Strider still afraid, went ahead Merry. Sam Strider came behind, one side Frodo’s pony, path broad enough four five hobbits walk abreast. But gone far Pippin came running back, followed Merry. They looked terrified. ‘There trolls!’ Pippin panted. ‘Down clearing woods far below. We got sight tree-trunks. They large!’ ‘We come look them,’ said Strider, picking stick. Frodo said nothing, Sam looked scared. The sun high, shone half-stripped branches trees, lit clearing bright patches light. They halted suddenly edge, peered tree-trunks, holding breath. There stood trolls: three large trolls. One stooping, two stood staring him. Strider walked forward unconcernedly. ‘Get up, old stone!’ said, broke stick upon stooping troll. Nothing happened. There gasp astonishment hobbits, even Frodo laughed. ‘Well!’ said. ‘We forgetting family history! These must three caught Gandalf, quarrelling right way cook thirteen dwarves one hobbit.’ ‘I idea anywhere near place!’ said Pippin. He knew story well. Bilbo Frodo told often; matter fact never half believed it. Even looked stone trolls suspicion, wondering magic might suddenly bring life again. ‘You forgetting family history, ever knew trolls,’ said Strider. ‘It broad daylight bright sun, yet come back trying scare tale live trolls waiting us glade! In case might noticed one old bird’s nest behind ear. That would unusual ornament live troll!’ They laughed. Frodo felt spirits reviving: reminder Bilbo’s first successful adventure heartening. The sun, too, warm comforting, mist eyes seemed lifting little. They rested time glade, took mid-day meal right shadow trolls’ large legs. ‘Won’t somebody give us bit song, sun high?’ said Merry, finished. ‘We haven’t song tale days.’ ‘Not since Weathertop,’ said Frodo. The others looked him. ‘Don’t worry me!’ added. ‘I feel much better, I don’t think I could sing. Perhaps Sam could dig something memory.’ ‘Come on, Sam!’ said Merry. ‘There’s stored head let about.’ ‘I don’t know that,’ said Sam. ‘But would suit? It ain’t I call proper poetry, understand me: bit nonsense. But old images brought mind.’ Standing up, hands behind back, school, began sing old tune. Troll sat alone seat stone, And munched mumbled bare old bone; For many year gnawed near, For meat hard come by. Done by! Gum by! In cave hills dwelt alone, And meat hard come by. Up came Tom big boots on. Said Troll: ‘Pray, yon? For looks like shin o’ nuncle Tim, As a-lyin’ graveyard. Caveyard! Paveyard! This many year Tim gone, And I thought lyin’ graveyard.’ ‘My lad,’ said Troll, ‘this bone I stole. But bones lie hole? Thy nuncle dead lump o’ lead, Afore I found shinbone. Tinbone! Thinbone! He spare share poor old troll, For don’t need shinbone.’ Said Tom: ‘I don’t see likes o’ thee Without axin’ leave go makin’ free With shank shin o’ father’s kin; So hand old bone over! Rover! Trover! Though dead be, belongs he; So hand old bone over!’ ‘For couple o’ pins,’ says Troll, grins, ‘I’ll eat thee too, gnaw thy shins. A bit o’ fresh meat go sweet! I’ll try teeth thee now. Hee now! See now! I’m tired o’ gnawing old bones skins; I’ve mind dine thee now.’ But thought dinner caught, He found hands hold naught. Before could mind, Tom slipped behind And gave boot larn him. Warn him! Darn him! A bump o’ boot seat, Tom thought, Would way larn him. But harder stone flesh bone Of troll sits hills alone. As well set boot mountain’s root, For seat troll don’t feel it. Peel it! Heal it! Old Troll laughed, heard Tom groan, And knew toes could feel it. Tom’s leg game, since home came, And bootless foot lasting lame; But Troll don’t care, he’s still With bone boned owner. Doner! Boner! Troll’s old seat still same, And bone boned owner! ‘Well, that’s warning us all!’ laughed Merry. ‘It well used stick, hand, Strider!’ ‘Where come that, Sam?’ asked Pippin. ‘I’ve never heard words before.’ Sam muttered something inaudible. ‘It’s head, course,’ said Frodo. ‘I learning lot Sam Gamgee journey. First conspirator, he’s jester. He’ll end becoming wizard – warrior!’ ‘I hope not,’ said Sam. ‘I don’t want neither!’ In afternoon went woods. They probably following track Gandalf, Bilbo, dwarves used many years before. After miles came top high bank Road. At point Road left Hoarwell far behind narrow valley, clung close feet hills, rolling winding eastward among woods heathercovered slopes towards Ford Mountains. Not far bank Strider pointed stone grass. On roughly cut much weathered could still seen dwarf-runes secret marks. ‘There!’ said Merry. ‘That must stone marked place trolls’ gold hidden. How much left Bilbo’s share, I wonder, Frodo?’ Frodo looked stone, wished Bilbo brought home treasure perilous, less easy part with. ‘None all,’ said. ‘Bilbo gave away. He told feel really his, came robbers.’ The Road lay quiet long shadows early evening. There sign travellers seen. As possible course take, climbed bank, turning left went fast could. Soon shoulder hills cut light fast westering sun. A cold wind flowed meet mountains ahead. They beginning look place Road, could camp night, heard sound brought sudden fear back hearts: noise hoofs behind them. They looked back, could see far many windings rollings Road. As quickly could scrambled beaten way deep heather bilberry brushwood slopes above, came small patch thick-growing hazels. As peered among bushes, could see Road, faint grey failing light, thirty feet them. The sound hoofs drew nearer. They going fast, light clippety-clippety-clip. Then faintly, blown away breeze, seemed catch dim ringing, small bells tinkling. ‘That sound like Black Rider’s horse!’ said Frodo, listening intently. The hobbits agreed hopefully not, remained full suspicion. They fear pursuit long sound behind seemed ominous unfriendly. But Strider leaning forward, stooped ground, hand ear, look joy face. The light faded, leaves bushes rustled softly. Clearer nearer bells jingled, clippety-clip came quick trotting feet. Suddenly view came white horse, gleaming shadows, running swiftly. In dusk headstall flickered flashed, studded gems like living stars. The rider’s cloak streamed behind him, hood thrown back; golden hair flowed shimmering wind speed. To Frodo appeared white light shining form raiment rider, thin veil. Strider sprang hiding dashed towards Road, leaping cry heather; even moved called, rider reined horse halted, looking towards thicket stood. When saw Strider, dismounted ran meet calling out: Ai na vedui Du´nadan! Mae govannen! His speech clear ringing voice left doubt hearts: rider Elven-folk. No others dwelt wide world voices fair hear. But seemed note haste fear call, saw speaking quickly urgently Strider. Soon Strider beckoned them, hobbits left bushes hurried Road. ‘This Glorfindel, dwells house Elrond,’ said Strider. ‘Hail, well met last!’ said Elf-lord Frodo. ‘I sent Rivendell look you. We feared danger upon road.’ ‘Then Gandalf reached Rivendell?’ cried Frodo joyfully. ‘No. He I departed; nine days ago,’ answered Glorfindel. ‘Elrond received news troubled him. Some kindred, journeying land beyond Baranduin,* learned things amiss, sent messages swiftly could. They said Nine abroad, astray bearing great burden without guidance, Gandalf returned. There even Rivendell ride openly Nine; were, Elrond sent north, west, south. It thought might turn far aside avoid pursuit, become lost Wilderness. ‘It lot take Road, I came Bridge Mitheithel, left token there, nigh seven days ago. Three servants Sauron upon Bridge, withdrew I pursued westward. I came also upon two others, turned away southward. Since I searched trail. Two days ago I found it, followed Bridge; today I marked descended hills again. But come! There time news. Since must risk peril Road go. There five behind us, find trail upon Road ride us like wind. And all. Where four may be, I know. I fear may find Ford already held us.’ While Glorfindel speaking shades evening deepened. Frodo felt great weariness come him. Ever since sun began sink mist eyes darkened, * The Brandywine River. felt shadow coming faces friends. Now pain assailed him, felt cold. He swayed, clutching Sam’s arm. ‘My master sick wounded,’ said Sam angrily. ‘He can’t go riding nightfall. He needs rest.’ Glorfindel caught Frodo sank ground, taking gently arms looked face grave anxiety. Briefly Strider told attack camp Weathertop, deadly knife. He drew hilt, kept, handed Elf. Glorfindel shuddered took it, looked intently it. ‘There evil things written hilt,’ said; ‘though maybe eyes cannot see them. Keep it, Aragorn, till reach house Elrond! But wary, handle little may! Alas! wounds weapon beyond skill heal. I I – I urge go without rest.’ He searched wound Frodo’s shoulder fingers, face grew graver, learned disquieted him. But Frodo felt chill lessen side arm; little warmth crept shoulder hand, pain grew easier. The dusk evening seemed grow lighter him, cloud withdrawn. He saw friends’ faces clearly again, measure new hope strength returned. ‘You shall ride horse,’ said Glorfindel. ‘I shorten stirrups saddle-skirts, must sit tight can. But need fear: horse let rider fall I command bear. His pace light smooth; danger presses near, bear away speed even black steeds enemy cannot rival.’ ‘No, not!’ said Frodo. ‘I shall ride him, I carried Rivendell anywhere else, leaving friends behind danger.’ Glorfindel smiled. ‘I doubt much,’ said, ‘if friends would danger them! The pursuit would follow leave us peace, I think. It you, Frodo, bear brings us peril.’ To Frodo answer, persuaded mount Glorfindel’s white horse. The pony laden instead great part others’ burdens, marched lighter, time made good speed; hobbits began find hard keep swift tireless feet Elf. On led them, mouth darkness, still deep clouded night. There neither star moon. Not grey dawn allow halt. Pippin, Merry, Sam time nearly asleep stumbling legs; even Strider seemed sag shoulders weary. Frodo sat upon horse dark dream. They cast heather yards road-side, fell asleep immediately. They seemed hardly closed eyes Glorfindel, set watch slept, awoke again. The sun climbed far morning, clouds mists night gone. ‘Drink this!’ said Glorfindel them, pouring turn little liquor silver-studded flask leather. It clear spring water taste, feel either cool warm mouth; strength vigour seemed flow limbs drank it. Eaten draught stale bread dried fruit (which left) seemed satisfy hunger better many good breakfast Shire done. They rested rather less five hours took Road again. Glorfindel still urged on, allowed two brief halts day’s march. In way covered almost twenty miles nightfall, came point Road bent right ran towards bottom valley, making straight Bruinen. So far sign sound pursuit hobbits could see hear; often Glorfindel would halt listen moment, lagged behind, look anxiety clouded face. Once twice spoke Strider elf-tongue. But however anxious guides might be, plain hobbits could go night. They stumbling along dizzy weariness, unable think anything feet legs. Frodo’s pain redoubled, day things faded shadows ghostly grey. He almost welcomed coming night, world seemed less pale empty. The hobbits still weary, set early next morning. There many miles yet go Ford, hobbled forward best pace could manage. ‘Our peril greatest ere reach river,’ said Glorfindel; ‘for heart warns pursuit swift behind us, danger may waiting Ford.’ The Road still running steadily downhill, places much grass either side, hobbits walked could, ease tired feet. In late afternoon came place Road went suddenly dark shadow tall pine-trees, plunged deep cutting steep moist walls red stone. Echoes ran along hurried forward; seemed sound many footfalls following own. All once, gate light, Road ran end tunnel open. There bottom sharp incline saw long flat mile, beyond Ford Rivendell. On side steep brown bank, threaded winding path; behind tall mountains climbed, shoulder shoulder, peak beyond peak, fading sky. There still echo following feet cutting behind them; rushing noise wind rising pouring branches pines. One moment Glorfindel turned listened, sprang forward loud cry. ‘Fly!’ called. ‘Fly! The enemy upon us!’ The white horse leaped forward. The hobbits ran slope. Glorfindel Strider followed rearguard. They half way across flat, suddenly noise horses galloping. Out gate trees left rode Black Rider. He reined horse in, halted, swaying saddle. Another followed him, another; two more. ‘Ride forward! Ride!’ cried Glorfindel Frodo. He obey once, strange reluctance seized him. Checking horse walk, turned looked back. The Riders seemed sit upon great steeds like threatening statues upon hill, dark solid, woods land receded mist. Suddenly knew heart silently commanding wait. Then fear hatred awoke him. His hand left bridle gripped hilt sword, red flash drew it. ‘Ride on! Ride on!’ cried Glorfindel, loud clear called horse elf-tongue: noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth! At white horse sprang away sped like wind along last lap Road. At moment black horses leaped hill pursuit, Riders came terrible cry, Frodo heard filling woods horror Eastfarthing far away. It answered; dismay Frodo friends trees rocks away left four Riders came flying. Two rode towards Frodo; two galloped madly towards Ford cut escape. They seemed run like wind grow swiftly larger darker, courses converged his. Frodo looked back moment shoulder. He could longer see friends. The Riders behind falling back: even great steeds match speed white elf-horse Glorfindel. He looked forward again, hope faded. There seemed chance reaching Ford cut others lain ambush. He could see clearly now: appeared cast aside hoods black cloaks, robed white grey. Swords naked pale hands; helms heads. Their cold eyes glittered, called fell voices. Fear filled Frodo’s mind. He thought longer sword. No cry came him. He shut eyes clung horse’s mane. The wind whistled ears, bells upon harness rang wild shrill. A breath deadly cold pierced like spear, last spurt, like flash white fire, elf-horse speeding wings, passed right face foremost Rider. Frodo heard splash water. It foamed feet. He felt quick heave surge horse left river struggled stony path. He climbing steep bank. He across Ford. But pursuers close behind. At top bank horse halted turned neighing fiercely. There Nine Riders water’s edge below, Frodo’s spirit quailed threat uplifted faces. He knew nothing would prevent crossing easily done; felt useless try escape long uncertain path Ford edge Rivendell, Riders crossed. In case felt commanded urgently halt. Hatred stirred him, longer strength refuse. Suddenly foremost Rider spurred horse forward. It checked water reared up. With great effort Frodo sat upright brandished sword. ‘Go back!’ cried. ‘Go back Land Mordor, follow more!’ His voice sounded thin shrill ears. The Riders halted, Frodo power Bombadil. His enemies laughed harsh chilling laughter. ‘Come back! Come back!’ called. ‘To Mordor take you!’ ‘Go back!’ whispered. ‘The Ring! The Ring!’ cried deadly voices; immediately leader urged horse forward water, followed closely two others. ‘By Elbereth Lu´thien Fair,’ said Frodo last effort, lifting sword, ‘you shall neither Ring me!’ Then leader, half across Ford, stood menacing stirrups, raised hand. Frodo stricken dumb. He felt tongue cleave mouth, heart labouring. His sword broke fell shaking hand. The elf-horse reared snorted. The foremost black horses almost set foot upon shore. At moment came roaring rushing: noise loud waters rolling many stones. Dimly Frodo saw river rise, along course came plumed cavalry waves. White flames seemed Frodo flicker crests, half fancied saw amid water white riders upon white horses frothing manes. The three Riders still midst Ford overwhelmed: disappeared, buried suddenly angry foam. Those behind drew back dismay. With last failing senses Frodo heard cries, seemed saw, beyond Riders hesitated shore, shining figure white light; behind ran small shadowy forms waving flames, flared red grey mist falling world. The black horses filled madness, leaping forward terror bore riders rushing flood. Their piercing cries drowned roaring river 281 carried away. Then Frodo felt falling, roaring confusion seemed rise engulf together enemies. He heard saw more. . BOOKTWO . Chapter 1 MANY MEETINGS Frodo woke found lying bed. At first thought slept late, long unpleasant dream still hovered edge memory. Or perhaps ill? But ceiling looked strange; flat, dark beams richly carved. He lay little longer looking patches sunlight wall, listening sound waterfall. ‘Where I, time?’ said aloud ceiling. ‘In house Elrond, ten o’clock morning,’ said voice. ‘It morning October twentyfourth, want know.’ ‘Gandalf!’criedFrodo,sittingup.Therewastheoldwizard, sitting chair open window. ‘Yes,’ said, ‘I here. And lucky here, too, absurd things done since left home.’ Frodo lay again. He felt comfortable peaceful argue, case think would get better argument. He fully awake now, memory journey returning: disastrous ‘short cut’ Old Forest; ‘accident’ The Prancing Pony; madness putting Ring dell Weathertop. While thinking things trying vain bring memory arriving Rivendell, long silence, broken soft puffs Gandalf’s pipe, blew white smoke-rings window. ‘Where’s Sam?’ Frodo asked length. ‘And others right?’ ‘Yes, safe sound,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Sam I sent get rest, half hour ago.’ ‘What happened Ford?’ said Frodo. ‘It seemed dim, somehow; still does.’ ‘Yes, would. You beginning fade,’ answered Gandalf. ‘The wound overcoming last. A hours would beyond aid. But strength you, dear hobbit! As showed Barrow. That touch go: perhaps dangerous moment all. I wish could held Weathertop.’ ‘You seem know great deal already,’ said Frodo. ‘I spoken others Barrow. At first horrible, afterwards things think about. How know it?’ ‘You talked long sleep, Frodo,’ said Gandalf gently, ‘and hard read mind memory. Do worry! Though I said ‘‘absurd’’ now, I mean it. I think well – others. It small feat come far, dangers, still bearing Ring.’ ‘We never done without Strider,’ said Frodo. ‘But needed you. I know without you.’ ‘I delayed,’ said Gandalf, ‘and nearly proved ruin. And yet I sure: may better so.’ ‘I wish would tell happened!’ ‘All good time! You supposed talk worry anything today, Elrond’s orders.’ ‘But talking would stop thinking wondering, quite tiring,’ said Frodo. ‘I wide awake now, I remember many things want explaining. Why delayed? You ought tell least.’ ‘You soon hear wish know,’ said Gandalf. ‘We shall Council, soon well enough. At moment I say I held captive.’ ‘You?’ cried Frodo. ‘Yes, I, Gandalf Grey,’ said wizard solemnly. ‘There many powers world, good evil. Some greater I am. Against I yet measured. But time coming. The Morgul-lord Black Riders come forth. War preparing!’ ‘Then knew Riders already – I met them?’ ‘Yes, I knew them. Indeed I spoke you; Black Riders Ringwraiths, Nine Servants Lord Rings. But I know arisen I fled once. I heard news I left June; story must wait. For moment saved disaster, Aragorn.’ ‘Yes,’ said Frodo, ‘it Strider saved us. Yet I afraid first. Sam never quite trusted him, I think, rate met Glorfindel.’ Gandalf smiled. ‘I heard Sam,’ said. ‘He doubts now.’ ‘I glad,’ said Frodo. ‘For I become fond Strider. Well, fond right word. I mean dear me; though strange, grim times. In fact, reminds often you. I didn’t know Big People like that. I thought, well, big, rather stupid: kind stupid like Butterbur; stupid wicked like Bill Ferny. But don’t know much Men Shire, except perhaps Bree-landers.’ ‘You don’t know much even them, think old Barliman stupid,’ said Gandalf. ‘He wise enough ground. He thinks less talks, slower; yet see brick wall time (as say Bree). But left Middle-earth like Aragorn son Arathorn. The race Kings Sea nearly end. It may War Ring last adventure.’ ‘Do really mean Strider one people old Kings?’ said Frodo wonder. ‘I thought vanished long ago. I thought Ranger.’ ‘Only Ranger!’ cried Gandalf. ‘My dear Frodo, Rangers are: last remnant North great people, Men West. They helped before; I shall need help days come; reached Rivendell, Ring yet rest.’ ‘I suppose not,’ said Frodo. ‘But far thought get here; I hope I shan’t go further. It pleasant rest. I month exile adventure, I find much I want.’ He fell silent shut eyes. After spoke again. ‘I reckoning,’ said, ‘and I can’t bring total October twenty-fourth. It ought twenty-first. We must reached Ford twentieth.’ ‘You talked reckoned good you,’ said Gandalf. ‘How side shoulder feel now?’ ‘I don’t know,’ Frodo answered. ‘They don’t feel all: improvement, but’ – made effort – ‘I move arm little. Yes, coming back life. It cold,’ added, touching left hand right. ‘Good!’ said Gandalf. ‘It mending fast. You soon sound again. Elrond cured you: tended days, ever since brought in.’ ‘Days?’ said Frodo. ‘Well, four nights three days, exact. The Elves brought Ford night twentieth, lost count. We terribly anxious, Sam hardly left side, day night, except run messages. Elrond master healing, weapons Enemy deadly. To tell truth, I little hope; I suspected fragment blade still closed wound. But could found last night. Then Elrond removed splinter. It deeply buried, working inwards.’ Frodo shuddered, remembering cruel knife notched blade vanished Strider’s hands. ‘Don’t alarmed!’ said Gandalf. ‘It gone now. It melted. And seems Hobbits fade reluctantly. I known strong warriors Big People would quickly overcome splinter, bore seventeen days.’ ‘What would done me?’ asked Frodo. ‘What Riders trying do?’ ‘They tried pierce heart Morgul-knife remains wound. If succeeded, would become like are, weaker command. You would become wraith dominion Dark Lord; would tormented trying keep Ring, greater torment possible robbed seeing hand.’ ‘Thank goodness I realize horrible danger!’ said Frodo faintly. ‘I mortally afraid, course; I known more, I dared even move. It marvel I escaped!’ ‘Yes, fortune fate helped you,’ said Gandalf, ‘not mention courage. For heart touched, shoulder pierced; resisted last. But terribly narrow shave, speak. You gravest peril wore Ring, half wraith-world yourself, might seized you. You could see them, could see you.’ ‘I know,’ said Frodo. ‘They terrible behold! But could see horses?’ ‘Because real horses; black robes real robes wear give shape nothingness dealings living.’ ‘Then black horses endure riders? All animals terrified draw near, even elf-horse Glorfindel. The dogs howl geese scream them.’ ‘Because horses born bred service Dark Lord Mordor. Not servants chattels wraiths! There orcs trolls, wargs werewolves; still many Men, warriors kings, walk alive Sun, yet sway. And number growing daily.’ ‘What Rivendell Elves? Is Rivendell safe?’ ‘Yes, present, else conquered. The Elves may fear Dark Lord, may fly him, never listen serve him. And Rivendell live still chief foes: Elven-wise, lords Eldar beyond furthest seas. They fear Ringwraiths, dwelt Blessed Realm live worlds, Seen Unseen great power.’ ‘I thought I saw white figure shone grow dim like others. Was Glorfindel then?’ ‘Yes, saw moment upon side: one mighty Firstborn. He Elf-lord house princes. Indeed power Rivendell withstand might Mordor, while: elsewhere powers still dwell. There power, too, another kind Shire. But places soon become islands siege, things go going. The Dark Lord putting forth strength. ‘Still,’ said, standing suddenly sticking chin, beard went stiff straight like bristling wire, ‘we must keep courage. You soon well, I talk death. You Rivendell, need worry anything present.’ ‘I haven’t courage keep up,’ said Frodo, ‘but I worried moment. Just give news friends, tell end affair Ford, I keep asking, I shall content present. After I shall another sleep, I think; I shan’t able close eyes finished story me.’ Gandalf moved chair bedside took good look Frodo. The colour come back face, eyes clear, fully awake aware. He smiling, seemed little wrong him. But wizard’s eye faint change, hint transparency, him, especially left hand lay outside upon coverlet. ‘Still must expected,’ said Gandalf himself. ‘He half yet, come end even Elrond foretell. Not evil, I think. He may become like glass filled clear light eyes see can.’ ‘You look splendid,’ said aloud. ‘I risk brief tale without consulting Elrond. But quite brief, mind you, must sleep again. This happened, far I gather. The Riders made straight you, soon fled. They need guidance horses longer: become visible them, already threshold world. And also Ring drew them. Your friends sprang aside, road, would ridden down. They knew nothing could save you, white horse could not. The Riders swift overtake, many oppose. On foot even Glorfindel Aragorn together could withstand Nine once. ‘When Ringwraiths swept by, friends ran behind. Close Ford small hollow beside road masked stunted trees. There hastily kindled fire; Glorfindel knew flood would come down, Riders tried cross, would deal left side river. The moment flood appeared, rushed out, followed Aragorn others flaming brands. Caught fire water, seeing Elf-lord revealed wrath, dismayed, horses stricken madness. Three carried away first assault flood; others hurled water horses overwhelmed.’ ‘And end Black Riders?’ asked Frodo. ‘No,’ said Gandalf. ‘Their horses must perished, without crippled. But Ringwraiths cannot easily destroyed. However, nothing fear present. Your friends crossed flood passed found lying face top bank, broken sword you. The horse standing guard beside you. You pale cold, feared dead, worse. Elrond’s folk met them, carrying slowly towards Rivendell.’ ‘Who made flood?’ asked Frodo. ‘Elrond commanded it,’ answered Gandalf. ‘The river valley power, rise anger great need bar Ford. As soon captain Ringwraiths rode water flood released. If I may say so, I added touches own: may noticed, waves took form great white horses shining white riders; many rolling grinding boulders. For moment I afraid let loose fierce wrath, flood would get hand wash away. There great vigour waters come snows Misty Mountains.’ ‘Yes, comes back now,’ said Frodo: ‘the tremendous roaring. I thought I drowning, friends enemies all. But safe!’ Gandalf looked quickly Frodo, shut eyes. ‘Yes, safe present. Soon feasting merrymaking celebrate victory Ford Bruinen, places honour.’ ‘Splendid!’ said Frodo. ‘It wonderful Elrond, Glorfindel great lords, mention Strider, take much trouble show much kindness.’ ‘Well, many reasons should,’ said Gandalf, smiling. ‘I one good reason. The Ring another: Ring-bearer. And heir Bilbo, Ring-finder.’ ‘Dear Bilbo!’ said Frodo sleepily. ‘I wonder is. I wish could hear it. It would made laugh. The cow jumped Moon! And poor old troll!’ With fell fast asleep. Frodo safe Last Homely House east Sea. That house was, Bilbo long ago reported, ‘a perfect house, whether like food sleep story-telling singing, sitting thinking best, pleasant mixture all’. Merely cure weariness, fear, sadness. As evening drew on, Frodo woke again, found longer felt need rest sleep, mind food drink, probably singing story-telling afterwards. He got bed discovered arm already nearly useful ever been. He found laid ready clean garments green cloth fitted excellently. Looking mirror startled see much thinner reflection remembered: looked remarkably like young nephew Bilbo used go tramping uncle Shire; eyes looked thoughtfully. ‘Yes, seen thing two since last peeped looking-glass,’ said reflection. ‘But merry meeting!’ He stretched arms whistled tune. At moment knock door, Sam came in. He ran Frodo took left hand, awkwardly shyly. He stroked gently blushed turned hastily away. ‘Hullo, Sam!’ said Frodo. ‘It’s warm!’ said Sam. ‘Meaning hand, Mr. Frodo. It felt cold long nights. But glory trumpets!’ cried, turning round shining eyes dancing floor. ‘It’s fine see again, sir! Gandalf asked come see ready come down, I thought joking.’ ‘I ready,’ said Frodo. ‘Let’s go look rest party!’ ‘I take them, sir,’ said Sam. ‘It’s big house this, peculiar. Always bit discover, knowing you’ll find round corner. And Elves, sir! Elves here, Elves there! Some like kings, terrible splendid; merry children. And music singing – I time heart much listening since got here. But I’m getting know ways place.’ ‘I know doing, Sam,’ said Frodo, taking arm. ‘But shall merry tonight, listen heart’s content. Come on, guide round corners!’ Sam led along several passages many steps high garden steep bank river. He found friends sitting porch side house looking east. Shadows fallen valley below, still light faces mountains far above. The air warm. The sound running falling water loud, evening filled faint scent trees flowers, summer still lingered Elrond’s gardens. ‘Hurray!’ cried Pippin, springing up. ‘Here noble cousin! Make way Frodo, Lord Ring!’ ‘Hush!’ said Gandalf shadows back porch. ‘Evil things come valley; name them. The Lord Ring Frodo, master Dark Tower Mordor, whose power stretching world. We sitting fortress. Outside getting dark.’ ‘Gandalf saying many cheerful things like that,’ said Pippin. ‘He thinks I need keeping order. But seems impossible, somehow, feel gloomy depressed place. I feel I could sing, I knew right song occasion.’ ‘I feel like singing myself,’ laughed Frodo. ‘Though moment I feel like eating drinking.’ ‘That soon cured,’ said Pippin. ‘You shown usual cunning getting time meal.’ ‘More meal! A feast!’ said Merry. ‘As soon Gandalf reported recovered, preparations began.’ He hardly finished speaking summoned hall ringing many bells. The hall Elrond’s house filled folk: Elves part, though guests sorts. Elrond, custom, sat great chair end long table upon dais; next one side sat Glorfindel, side sat Gandalf. Frodo looked wonder; never seen Elrond, many tales spoke; sat upon right hand left, Glorfindel, even Gandalf, thought knew well, revealed lords dignity power. Gandalf shorter stature two; long white hair, sweeping silver beard, broad shoulders, made look like wise king ancient legend. In aged face great snowy brows dark eyes set like coals could leap suddenly fire. Glorfindel tall straight; hair shining gold, face fair young fearless full joy; eyes bright keen, voice like music; brow sat wisdom, hand strength. The face Elrond ageless, neither old young, though written memory many things glad sorrowful. His hair dark shadows twilight, upon set circlet silver; eyes grey clear evening, light like light stars. Venerable seemed king crowned many winters, yet hale tried warrior fulness strength. He Lord Rivendell mighty among Elves Men. In middle table, woven cloths upon wall, chair canopy, sat lady fair look upon, like form womanhood Elrond Frodo guessed one close kindred. Young yet so. The braids dark hair touched frost; white arms clear face flawless smooth, light stars bright eyes, grey cloudless night; yet queenly looked, thought knowledge glance, one known many things years bring. Above brow head covered cap silver lace netted small gems, glittering white; soft grey raiment ornament save girdle leaves wrought silver. So Frodo saw mortals yet seen; Arwen, daughter Elrond, said likeness Lu´thien come earth again; called Undo´miel, Evenstar people. Long land mother’s kin, Lo´rien beyond mountains, lately returned Rivendell father’s house. But brothers, Elladan Elrohir, upon errantry; rode often far afield Rangers North, forgetting never mother’s torment dens orcs. Such loveliness living thing Frodo never seen imagined mind; surprised abashed find seat Elrond’s table among folk high fair. Though suitable chair, raised upon several cushions, felt small, rather place; feeling quickly passed. The feast merry food hunger could desire. It time looked even turned neighbours. He looked first friends. Sam begged allowed wait master, told time guest honour. Frodo could see now, sitting Pippin Merry upper end one side-tables close dais. He could see sign Strider. Next Frodo right sat dwarf important appearance, richly dressed. His beard, long forked, white, nearly white snow-white cloth garments. He wore silver belt, round neck hung chain silver diamonds. Frodo stopped eating look him. ‘Welcome well met!’ said dwarf, turning towards him. Then actually rose seat bowed. ‘Glo´in service,’ said, bowed still lower. ‘Frodo Baggins service family’s,’ said Frodo correctly, rising surprise scattering cushions. ‘Am I right guessing Glo´in, one twelve companions great Thorin Oakenshield?’ ‘Quite right,’ answered dwarf, gathering cushions courteously assisting Frodo back seat. ‘And I ask, I already told kinsman adopted heir friend Bilbo renowned. Allow congratulate recovery.’ ‘Thank much,’ said Frodo. ‘You strange adventures, I hear,’ said Glo´in. ‘I wonder greatly brings four hobbits long journey. Nothing like happened since Bilbo came us. But perhaps I inquire closely, since Elrond Gandalf seem disposed talk this?’ ‘I think speak it, least yet,’ said Frodo politely. He guessed even Elrond’s house matter Ring one casual talk; case wished forget troubles time. ‘But I equally curious,’ added, ‘to learn brings important dwarf far Lonely Mountain.’ Glo´in looked him. ‘If heard, I think speak yet either. Master Elrond summon us ere long, I believe, shall hear many things. But much else may told.’ Throughout rest meal talked together, Frodo listened spoke; news Shire, apart Ring, seemed small far-away unimportant, Glo´in much tell events northern regions Wilderland. Frodo learned Grimbeorn Old, son Beorn, lord many sturdy men, land Mountains Mirkwood neither orc wolf dared go. ‘Indeed,’ said Glo´in, ‘if Beornings, passage Dale Rivendell would long ago become impossible. They valiant men keep open High Pass Ford Carrock. But tolls high,’ added shake head; ‘and like Beorn old fond dwarves. Still, trusty, much days. Nowhere men friendly us Men Dale. They good folk, Bardings. The grandson Bard Bowman rules them, Brand son Bain son Bard. He strong king, realm reaches far south east Esgaroth.’ ‘And people?’ asked Frodo. ‘There much tell, good bad,’ said Glo´in; ‘yet mostly good: far fortunate, though escape shadow times. If really wish hear us, I tell tidings gladly. But stop weary! Dwarves’ tongues run speaking handiwork, say.’ And Glo´in embarked long account doings Dwarf-kingdom. He delighted found polite listener; Frodo showed sign weariness made attempt change subject, though actually soon got rather lost among strange names people places never heard before. He interested, however, hear Da´in still King Mountain, old (having passed two hundred fiftieth year), venerable, fabulously rich. Of ten companions survived Battle Five Armies seven still him: Dwalin, Glo´in, Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur. Bombur fat could move couch chair table, took six young dwarves lift him. ‘And become Balin Ori O´ in?’ asked Frodo. A shadow passed Glo´in’s face. ‘We know,’ answered. ‘It largely account Balin I come ask advice dwell Rivendell. But tonight let us speak merrier things!’ Glo´in began talk works people, telling Frodo great labours Dale Mountain. ‘We done well,’ said. ‘But metal-work cannot rival fathers, many whose secrets lost. We make good armour keen swords, cannot make mail blade match made dragon came. Only mining building surpassed old days. You see waterways Dale, Frodo, fountains, pools! You see stonepaved roads many colours! And halls cavernous streets earth arches carved like trees; terraces towers upon Mountain’s sides! Then would see idle.’ ‘I come see them, ever I can,’ said Frodo. ‘How surprised Bilbo would see changes Desolation Smaug!’ Glo´in looked Frodo smiled. ‘You fond Bilbo not?’ asked. ‘Yes,’ answered Frodo. ‘I would rather see towers palaces world.’ At length feast came end. Elrond Arwen rose went hall, company followed due order. The doors thrown open, went across wide passage doors, came hall. In tables, bright fire burning great hearth carven pillars upon either side. Frodo found walking Gandalf. ‘This Hall Fire,’ said wizard. ‘Here hear many songs tales – keep awake. But except high days usually stands empty quiet, people come wish peace, thought. There always fire here, year round, little light.’ As Elrond entered went towards seat prepared him, Elvish minstrels began make sweet music. Slowly hall filled, Frodo looked delight upon many fair faces gathered together; golden firelight played upon shimmered hair. Suddenly noticed, far end fire, small dark figure seated stool back propped pillar. Beside ground drinking-cup bread. Frodo wondered whether ill (if people ever ill Rivendell), unable come feast. His head seemed sunk sleep breast, fold dark cloak drawn face. Elrond went forward stood beside silent figure. ‘Awake, little master!’ said, smile. Then, turning Frodo, beckoned him. ‘Now last hour come wished for, Frodo,’ said. ‘Here friend long missed.’ The dark figure raised head uncovered face. ‘Bilbo!’ cried Frodo sudden recognition, sprang forward. ‘Hullo, Frodo lad!’ said Bilbo. ‘So got last. I hoped would manage it. Well, well! So feasting honour, I hear. I hope enjoyed yourself?’ ‘Why weren’t there?’ cried Frodo. ‘And haven’t I allowed see before?’ ‘Because asleep. I seen good deal you. I sat side Sam day. But feast, I don’t go things much now. And I something else do.’ ‘What doing?’ ‘Why, sitting thinking. I lot nowadays, best place in, rule. Wake up, indeed!’ said, cocking eye Elrond. There bright twinkle sign sleepiness Frodo could see. ‘Wake up! I asleep, Master Elrond. If want know, come feast soon, disturbed – middle making song. I stuck line two, thinking them; I don’t suppose I shall ever get right. There deal singing ideas driven clean head. I shall get friend Du´nadan help me. Where he?’ Elrond laughed. ‘He shall found,’ said. ‘Then two shall go corner finish task, hear judge end merrymaking.’ Messengers sent find Bilbo’s friend, though none knew was, present feast. In meanwhile Frodo Bilbo sat side side, Sam came quickly placed near them. They talked together soft voices, oblivious mirth music hall them. Bilbo much say himself. When left Hobbiton wandered aimlessly, along Road country either side; somehow steered time towards Rivendell. ‘I got without much adventure,’ said, ‘and rest I went dwarves Dale: last journey. I shan’t travel again. Old Balin gone away. Then I came back here, I been. I done that. I written book. And, course, I make songs. They sing occasionally: please me, I think; for, course, aren’t really good enough Rivendell. And I listen I think. Time doesn’t seem pass here: is. A remarkable place altogether. ‘I hear kinds news, Mountains, South, hardly anything Shire. I heard Ring, course. Gandalf often. Not told great deal, become closer ever last years. The Du´nadan told more. Fancy ring mine causing disturbance! It pity Gandalf find sooner. I could brought thing long ago without much trouble. I thought several times going back Hobbiton it; I getting old, would let me: Gandalf Elrond, I mean. They seemed think Enemy looking high low me, would make mincemeat me, caught tottering Wild. ‘And Gandalf said: ‘‘The Ring passed on, Bilbo. It would good others, tried meddle again.’’ Odd sort remark, like Gandalf. But said looking you, I let things be. I frightfully glad see safe sound.’ He paused looked Frodo doubtfully. ‘Have got here?’ asked whisper. ‘I can’t help feeling curious, know, I’ve heard. I much like peep again.’ ‘Yes, I’ve got it,’ answered Frodo, feeling strange reluctance. ‘It looks ever did.’ ‘Well, I like see moment,’ said Bilbo. When dressed, Frodo found slept Ring hung neck new chain, light strong. Slowly drew out. Bilbo put hand. But Frodo quickly drew back Ring. To distress amazement found longer looking Bilbo; shadow seemed fallen them, found eyeing little wrinkled creature hungry face bony groping hands. He felt desire strike him. The music singing round seemed falter, silence fell. Bilbo looked quickly Frodo’s face passed hand across eyes. ‘I understand now,’ said. ‘Put away! I sorry: sorry come burden; sorry everything. Don’t adventures ever end? I suppose not. Someone else always carry story. Well, can’t helped. I wonder it’s good trying finish book? But don’t let’s worry – let’s real News! Tell Shire!’ Frodo hid Ring away, shadow passed leaving hardly shred memory. The light music Rivendell again. Bilbo smiled laughed happily. Every item news Shire Frodo could tell – aided corrected Sam – greatest interest him, felling least tree pranks smallest child Hobbiton. They deep doings Four Farthings notice arrival man clad dark green cloth. For many minutes stood looking smile. Suddenly Bilbo looked up. ‘Ah, last, Du´nadan!’ cried. ‘Strider!’ said Frodo. ‘You seem lot names.’ ‘Well, Strider one I haven’t heard before, anyway,’ said Bilbo. ‘What call for?’ ‘They call Bree,’ said Strider laughing, ‘and I introduced him.’ ‘And call Du´nadan?’ asked Frodo. ‘The Du´nadan,’ said Bilbo. ‘He often called here. But I thought knew enough Elvish least know du´nadan: Man West, Nu´meno´rean. But time lessons!’ He turned Strider. ‘Where been, friend? Why weren’t feast? The Lady Arwen there.’ Strider looked Bilbo gravely. ‘I know,’ said. ‘But often I must put mirth aside. Elladan Elrohir returned Wild unlooked-for, tidings I wished hear once.’ ‘Well, dear fellow,’ said Bilbo, ‘now you’ve heard news, can’t spare moment? I want help something urgent. Elrond says song mine finished end evening, I stuck. Let’s go corner polish up!’ Strider smiled. ‘Come then!’ said. ‘Let hear it!’ Frodo left while, Sam fallen asleep. He alone felt rather forlorn, although folk Rivendell gathered. But near silent, intent upon music voices instruments, gave heed anything else. Frodo began listen. At first beauty melodies interwoven words elven-tongues, even though understood little, held spell, soon began attend them. Almost seemed words took shape, visions far lands bright things never yet imagined opened him; firelit hall became like golden mist seas foam sighed upon margins world. Then enchantment became dreamlike, felt endless river swelling gold silver flowing him, multitudinous pattern comprehended; became part throbbing air him, drenched drowned him. Swiftly sank shining weight deep realm sleep. There wandered long dream music turned running water, suddenly voice. It seemed voice Bilbo chanting verses. Faint first clearer ran words. Ea¨rendil mariner tarried Arvernien; built boat timber felled Nimbrethil journey in; sails wove silver fair, silver lanterns made, prow fashioned like swan, light upon banners laid. In panoply ancient kings, chaine´d rings armoured him; shining shield scored runes ward wounds harm him; bow made dragon-horn, arrows shorn ebony, silver habergeon, scabbard chalcedony; sword steel valiant, adamant helmet tall, eagle-plume upon crest, upon breast emerald. Beneath Moon star wandered far northern strands, bewildered enchanted ways beyond days mortal lands. From gnashing Narrow Ice shadow lies frozen hills, nether heats burning waste turned haste, roving still starless waters far astray last came Night Naught, passed, never sight saw shining shore light sought. The winds wrath came driving him, blindly foam fled west east, errandless, unheralded homeward sped. There flying Elwing came him, flame darkness lit; bright light diamond fire upon carcanet. The Silmaril bound crowned living light, dauntless burning brow turned prow; night Otherworld beyond Sea strong free storm arose, wind power Tarmenel; paths seldom mortal goes boat bore biting breath might death across grey long-forsaken seas distressed: east west passed away. Through Evernight back borne black roaring waves ran o’er leagues unlit foundered shores drowned Days began, heard strands pearl ends world music long, ever-foaming billows roll yellow gold jewels wan. He saw Mountain silent rise twilight lies upon knees Valinor, Eldamar beheld afar beyond seas. A wanderer escaped night white came last, Elvenhome green fair keen air, pale glass beneath Hill Ilmarin a-glimmer valley sheer lamplit towers Tirion mirrored Shadowmere. He tarried errantry, melodies taught him, sages old marvels told, harps gold brought him. They clothed elven-white, seven lights sent, Calacirian hidden land forlorn went. He came unto timeless halls shining fall countless years, endless reigns Elder King Ilmarin Mountain sheer; words unheard spoken folk Men Elven-kin, beyond world visions showed forbid dwell therein. A ship new built mithril elven-glass shining prow; shaven oar sail bore silver mast: Silmaril lantern light banner bright living flame gleam thereon Elbereth set, thither came wings immortal made him, laid undying doom, sail shoreless skies come behind Sun light Moon. From Evereven’s lofty hills softly silver fountains fall wings bore, wandering light, beyond mighty Mountain Wall. From World’s End turned away, yearned find afar home shadows journeying, burning island star high mists came, distant flame Sun, wonder ere waking dawn grey Norland waters run. And Middle-earth passed heard last weeping sore women elven-maids Elder Days, years yore. But mighty doom laid, till Moon fade, orbe´d star pass, tarry never Hither Shores mortals are; ever still herald errand never rest bear shining lamp afar, Flammifer Westernesse. The chanting ceased. Frodo opened eyes saw Bilbo seated stool circle listeners, smiling applauding. ‘Now better again,’ said Elf. Bilbo got bowed. ‘I flattered, Lindir,’ said. ‘But would tiring repeat all.’ ‘Not tiring you,’ Elves answered laughing. ‘You know never tired reciting verses. But really cannot answer question one hearing!’ ‘What!’ cried Bilbo. ‘You can’t tell parts mine, Du´nadan’s?’ ‘It easy us tell difference two mortals,’ said Elf. ‘Nonsense, Lindir,’ snorted Bilbo. ‘If can’t distinguish Man Hobbit, judgement poorer I imagined. They’re different peas apples.’ ‘Maybe. To sheep sheep doubt appear different,’ laughed Lindir. ‘Or shepherds. But Mortals study. We business.’ ‘I won’t argue you,’ said Bilbo. ‘I sleepy much music singing. I’ll leave guess, want to.’ He got came towards Frodo. ‘Well, that’s over,’ said low voice. ‘It went better I expected. I don’t often get asked second hearing. What think it?’ ‘I going try guess,’ said Frodo smiling. ‘You needn’t,’ said Bilbo. ‘As matter fact mine. Except Aragorn insisted putting green stone. He seemed think important. I don’t know why. Otherwise obviously thought whole thing rather head, said I cheek make verses Ea¨rendil house Elrond, affair. I suppose right.’ ‘I don’t know,’ said Frodo. ‘It seemed fit somehow, though I can’t explain. I half asleep began, seemed follow something I dreaming about. I didn’t understand really speaking near end.’ ‘It difficult keep awake here, get used it,’ said Bilbo. ‘Not hobbits would ever acquire quite Elvish appetite music poetry tales. They seem like much food, more. They going long time yet. What say slipping quiet talk?’ ‘Can we?’ said Frodo. ‘Of course. This merrymaking business. Come go like, long don’t make noise.’ They got withdrew quietly shadows, made doors. Sam left behind, fast asleep still smile face. In spite delight Bilbo’s company Frodo felt tug regret passed Hall Fire. Even stepped threshold single clear voice rose song. A Elbereth Gilthoniel, silivren penna mı´riel menel aglar elenath! Na-chaered palan-dı´riel galadhremmin ennorath, Fanuilos, le linnathon nef aear, sı´ nef aearon! Frodo halted moment, looking back. Elrond chair fire face like summer-light upon trees. Near sat Lady Arwen. To surprise Frodo saw Aragorn stood beside her; dark cloak thrown back, seemed clad elven-mail, star shone breast. They spoke together, suddenly seemed Frodo Arwen turned towards him, light eyes fell afar pierced heart. He stood still enchanted, sweet syllables Elvish song fell like clear jewels blended word melody. ‘It song Elbereth,’ said Bilbo. ‘They sing that, songs Blessed Realm, many times tonight. Come on!’ He led Frodo back little room. It opened gardens looked south across ravine Bruinen. There sat while, looking window bright stars steep-climbing woods, talking softly. They spoke small news Shire far away, dark shadows perils encompassed them, fair things seen world together, Elves, stars, trees, gentle fall bright year woods. At last came knock door. ‘Begging pardon,’ said Sam, putting head, ‘but I wondering would wanting anything.’ ‘And begging yours, Sam Gamgee,’ replied Bilbo. ‘I guess mean time master went bed.’ ‘Well, sir, Council early tomorrow, I hear, got today first time.’ ‘Quite right, Sam,’ laughed Bilbo. ‘You trot tell Gandalf gone bed. Good night, Frodo! Bless me, good see again! There folk like hobbits real good talk. I getting old, I began wonder I live see chapters story. Good night! I’ll take walk, I think, look stars Elbereth garden. Sleep well!’ Chapter 2 THE COUNCIL OF ELROND Next day Frodo woke early, feeling refreshed well. He walked along terraces loud-flowing Bruinen watched pale, cool sun rise far mountains, shine down, slanting thin silver mist; dew upon yellow leaves glimmering, woven nets gossamer twinkled every bush. Sam walked beside him, saying nothing, sniffing air, looking every wonder eyes great heights East. The snow white upon peaks. On seat cut stone beside turn path came upon Gandalf Bilbo deep talk. ‘Hullo! Good morning!’ said Bilbo. ‘Feel ready great council?’ ‘I feel ready anything,’ answered Frodo. ‘But I like go walking today explore valley. I like get pine-woods there.’ He pointed away far side Rivendell north. ‘You mayhave chance later,’said Gandalf. ‘Butwe cannot make plans yet. There much hear decide today.’ Suddenly talking single clear bell rang out. ‘That warning bell Council Elrond,’ cried Gandalf. ‘Come along now! Both Bilbo wanted.’ Frodo Bilbo followed wizard quickly along winding path back house; behind them, uninvited moment forgotten, trotted Sam. Gandalf led porch Frodo found friends evening before. The light clear autumn morning glowing valley. The noise bubbling waters came foaming river-bed. Birds singing, wholesome peace lay land. To Frodo dangerous flight, rumours darkness growing world outside, already seemed memories troubled dream; faces turned meet entered grave. Elrond there, several others seated silence him. Frodo saw Glorfindel Glo´in; corner alone Strider sitting, clad old travel-worn clothes again. Elrond drew Frodo seat side, presented company, saying: ‘Here, friends, hobbit, Frodo son Drogo. Few ever come hither greater peril errand urgent.’ He pointed named Frodo met before. There younger dwarf Glo´in’s side: son Gimli. Beside Glorfindel several counsellors Elrond’s household, Erestor chief; Galdor, Elf Grey Havens come errand Cı´rdan Shipwright. There also strange Elf clad green brown, Legolas, messenger father, Thranduil, King Elves Northern Mirkwood. And seated little apart tall man fair noble face, dark-haired grey-eyed, proud stern glance. He cloaked booted journey horseback; indeed though garments rich, cloak lined fur, stained long travel. He collar silver single white stone set; locks shorn shoulders. On baldric wore great horn tipped silver laid upon knees. He gazed Frodo Bilbo sudden wonder. ‘Here,’ said Elrond, turning Gandalf, ‘is Boromir, man South. He arrived grey morning, seeks counsel. I bidden present, questions answered.’ Not spoken debated Council need told. Much said events world outside, especially South, wide lands east Mountains. Of things Frodo already heard many rumours; tale Glo´in new him, dwarf spoke listened attentively. It appeared amid splendour works hand hearts Dwarves Lonely Mountain troubled. ‘It many years ago,’ said Glo´in, ‘that shadow disquiet fell upon people. Whence came first perceive. Words began whispered secret: said hemmed narrow place, greater wealth splendour would found wider world. Some spoke Moria: mighty works fathers called tongue Khazad-duˆm; declared last power numbers return.’ Glo´in sighed. ‘Moria! Moria! Wonder Northern world! Too deep delved there, woke nameless fear. Long vast mansions lain empty since children Durin fled. But spoke longing, yet dread; dwarf dared pass doors Khazad-duˆm many lives kings, save Thro´r only, perished. At last, however, Balin listened whispers, resolved go; though Da´in give leave willingly, took Ori O´ many folk, went away south. ‘That nigh thirty years ago. For news seemed good: messages reported Moria entered great work begun there. Then silence, word ever come Moria since. ‘Then year ago messenger came Da´in, Moria – Mordor: horseman night, called Da´in gate. The Lord Sauron Great, said, wished friendship. Rings would give it, gave old. And asked urgently concerning hobbits, kind were, dwelt. ‘‘For Sauron knows,’’ said he, ‘‘that one known time.’’ ‘At greatly troubled, gave answer. And fell voice lowered, would sweetened could. ‘‘As small token friendship Sauron asks this,’’ said: ‘‘that find thief,’’ word, ‘‘and get him, willing no, little ring, least rings, stole. It trifle Sauron fancies, earnest good will. Find it, three rings Dwarf-sires possessed old shall returned you, realm Moria shall ever. Find news thief, whether still lives where, shall great reward lasting friendship Lord. Refuse, things seem well. Do refuse?’’ ‘At breath came like hiss snakes, stood shuddered, Da´in said: ‘‘I say neither yea nay. I must consider message means fair cloak.’’ ‘‘‘Consider well, long,’’ said he. ‘‘‘The time thought spend,’’ answered Da´in. ‘‘‘For present,’’ said he, rode darkness. ‘Heavy hearts chieftains since night. We needed fell voice messenger warn us words held menace deceit; knew already power re-entered Mordor changed, ever betrayed us old. Twice messenger returned, gone unanswered. The third last time, says, soon come, ending year. ‘And I sent last Da´in warn Bilbo sought Enemy, learn, may be, desires ring, least rings. Also crave advice Elrond. For Shadow grows draws nearer. We discover messengers come also King Brand Dale, afraid. We fear may yield. Already war gathering eastern borders. If make answer, Enemy may move Men rule assail King Brand, Da´in also.’ ‘You done well come,’ said Elrond. ‘You hear today need order understand purposes Enemy. There naught do, resist, hope without it. But stand alone. You learn trouble part trouble western world. The Ring! What shall Ring, least rings, trifle Sauron fancies? That doom must deem. ‘That purpose called hither. Called, I say, though I called me, strangers distant lands. You come met, nick time, chance may seem. Yet so. Believe rather ordered we, sit here, none others, must find counsel peril world. ‘Now, therefore, things shall openly spoken hidden day. And first, may understand peril, Tale Ring shall told beginning even present. And I begin tale, though others shall end it.’ Then listened Elrond clear voice spoke Sauron Rings Power, forging Second Age world long ago. A part tale known there, full tale none, many eyes turned Elrond fear wonder told Elven-smiths Eregion friendship Moria, eagerness knowledge, Sauron ensnared them. For time yet evil behold, received aid grew mighty craft, whereas learned secrets, betrayed them, forged secretly Mountain Fire One Ring master. But Celebrimbor aware him, hid Three made; war, land laid waste, gate Moria shut. Then years followed traced Ring; since history elsewhere recounted, even Elrond set books lore, recalled. For long tale, full deeds great terrible, briefly though Elrond spoke, sun rode sky, morning passing ere ceased. Of Nu´menor spoke, glory fall, return Kings Men Middle-earth deeps Sea, borne upon wings storm. Then Elendil Tall mighty sons, Isildur Ana´rion, became great lords; North-realm made Arnor, Southrealm Gondor mouths Anduin. But Sauron Mordor assailed them, made Last Alliance Elves Men, hosts Gil-galad Elendil mustered Arnor. Thereupon Elrond paused sighed. ‘I remember well splendour banners,’ said. ‘It recalled glory Elder Days hosts Beleriand, many great princes captains assembled. And yet many, fair, Thangorodrim broken, Elves deemed evil ended ever, so.’ ‘You remember?’ said Frodo, speaking thought aloud astonishment. ‘But I thought,’ stammered Elrond turned towards him, ‘I thought fall Gil-galad long age ago.’ ‘So indeed,’ answered Elrond gravely. ‘But memory reaches back even Elder Days. Ea¨rendil sire, born Gondolin fall; mother Elwing, daughter Dior, son Lu´thien Doriath. I seen three ages West world, many defeats, many fruitless victories. ‘I herald Gil-galad marched host. I Battle Dagorlad Black Gate Mordor, mastery: Spear Gil-galad Sword Elendil, Aeglos Narsil, none could withstand. I beheld last combat slopes Orodruin, Gil-galad died, Elendil fell, Narsil broke beneath him; Sauron overthrown, Isildur cut Ring hand hilt-shard father’s sword, took own.’ At stranger, Boromir, broke in. ‘So became Ring!’ cried. ‘If ever tale told South, long forgotten. I heard Great Ring name; believed perished world ruin first realm. Isildur took it! That tidings indeed.’ ‘Alas! yes,’ said Elrond. ‘Isildur took it, been. It cast Orodruin’s fire nigh hand made. But marked Isildur did. He alone stood father last mortal contest; Gil-galad Cı´rdan stood, I. But Isildur would listen counsel. ‘‘‘This I weregild father, brother,’’ said; therefore whether would no, took treasure it. But soon betrayed death; named North Isildur’s Bane. Yet death maybe better else might befallen him. ‘Only North tidings come, few. Small wonder heard them, Boromir. From ruin Gladden Fields, Isildur perished, three men came ever back mountains long wandering. One Ohtar, esquire Isildur, bore shards sword Elendil; brought Valandil, heir Isildur, child remained Rivendell. But Narsil broken light extinguished, yet forged again. ‘Fruitless I call victory Last Alliance? Not wholly so, yet achieve end. Sauron diminished, destroyed. His Ring lost unmade. The Dark Tower broken, foundations removed; made power Ring, remains endure. Many Elves many mighty Men, many friends, perished war. Ana´rion slain, Isildur slain; Gil-galad Elendil more. Never shall league Elves Men; Men multiply Firstborn decrease, two kindreds estranged. And ever since day race Nu´menor decayed, span years lessened. ‘In North war slaughter Gladden Fields Men Westernesse diminished, city Annu´minas beside Lake Evendim fell ruin; heirs Valandil removed dwelt Fornost high North Downs, desolate. Men call Deadmen’s Dike, fear tread there. For folk Arnor dwindled, foes devoured them, lordship passed, leaving green mounds grassy hills. ‘In South realm Gondor long endured; splendour grew, recalling somewhat might Nu´menor, ere fell. High towers people built, strong places, havens many ships; winged crown Kings Men held awe folk many tongues. Their chief city Osgiliath, Citadel Stars, midst River flowed. And Minas Ithil built, Tower Rising Moon, eastward upon shoulder Mountains Shadow; westward feet White Mountains Minas Anor made, Tower Setting Sun. There courts King grew white tree, seed tree Isildur brought deep waters, seed tree came Eresse¨a, Uttermost West Day days world young. ‘But wearing swift years Middle-earth line Meneldil son Ana´rion failed, Tree withered, blood Nu´meno´reans became mingled lesser men. Then watch upon walls Mordor slept, dark things crept back Gorgoroth. And time evil things came forth, took Minas Ithil abode it, made place dread; called Minas Morgul, Tower Sorcery. Then Minas Anor named anew Minas Tirith, Tower Guard; two cities ever war, Osgiliath lay deserted ruins shadows walked. ‘So many lives men. But Lords Minas Tirith still fight on, defying enemies, keeping passage River Argonath Sea. And part tale I shall tell drawn close. For days Isildur Ruling Ring passed knowledge, Three released dominion. But latter day peril more, sorrow One found. Others shall speak finding, I played small part.’ He ceased, Boromir stood up, tall proud, them. ‘Give leave, Master Elrond,’ said he, ‘first say Gondor, verily land Gondor I come. And would well know passes there. For few, I deem, know deeds, therefore guess little peril, fail last. ‘Believe land Gondor blood Nu´menor spent, pride dignity forgotten. By valour wild folk East still restrained, terror Morgul kept bay; thus alone peace freedom maintained lands behind us, bulwark West. But passages River won, then? ‘Yet hour, maybe, far away. The Nameless Enemy arisen again. Smoke rises Orodruin call Mount Doom. The power Black Land grows hard beset. When Enemy returned folk driven Ithilien, fair domain east River, though kept foothold strength arms. But year, days June, sudden war came upon us Mordor, swept away. We outnumbered, Mordor allied Easterlings cruel Haradrim; numbers defeated. A power felt before. ‘Some said could seen, like great black horseman, dark shadow moon. Wherever came madness filled foes, fear fell boldest, horse man gave way fled. Only remnant eastern force came back, destroying last bridge still stood amid ruins Osgiliath. ‘I company held bridge, cast behind us. Four saved swimming: brother two others. But still fight on, holding west shores Anduin; shelter behind us give us praise, ever hear name: much praise little help. Only Rohan men ride us call. ‘In evil hour I come errand many dangerous leagues Elrond: hundred ten days I journeyed alone. But I seek allies war. The might Elrond wisdom weapons, said. I come ask counsel unravelling hard words. For eve sudden assault dream came brother troubled sleep; afterwards like dream came oft again, me. ‘In dream I thought eastern sky grew dark growing thunder, West pale light lingered, I heard voice, remote clear, crying: Seek Sword broken: In Imladris dwells; There shall counsels taken Stronger Morgul-spells. There shall shown token That Doom near hand, For Isildur’s Bane shall waken, And Halfling forth shall stand. Of words could understand little, spoke father, Denethor, Lord Minas Tirith, wise lore Gondor. This would say, Imladris old name among Elves far northern dale, Elrond Halfelven dwelt, greatest lore-masters. Therefore brother, seeing desperate need, eager heed dream seek Imladris; since way full doubt danger, I took journey upon myself. Loth father give leave, long I wandered roads forgotten, seeking house Elrond, many heard, knew lay.’ ‘And house Elrond shall made clear you,’ said Aragorn, standing up. He cast sword upon table stood Elrond, blade two pieces. ‘Here Sword Broken!’ said. ‘And you, Minas Tirith?’ asked Boromir, looking wonder lean face Ranger weather-stained cloak. ‘He Aragorn son Arathorn,’ said Elrond; ‘and descended many fathers Isildur Elendil’s son Minas Ithil. He Chief Du´nedain North, left folk.’ ‘Then belongs you, all!’ cried Frodo amazement, springing feet, expected Ring demanded once. ‘It belong either us,’ said Aragorn; ‘but ordained hold while.’ ‘Bring Ring, Frodo!’ said Gandalf solemnly. ‘The time come. Hold up, Boromir understand remainder riddle.’ There hush, turned eyes Frodo. He shaken sudden shame fear; felt great reluctance reveal Ring, loathing touch. He wished far away. The Ring gleamed flickered held trembling hand. ‘Behold Isildur’s Bane!’ said Elrond. Boromir’s eyes glinted gazed golden thing. ‘The Halfling!’ muttered. ‘Is doom Minas Tirith come last? But seek broken sword?’ ‘The words doom Minas Tirith,’ said Aragorn. ‘But doom great deeds indeed hand. For Sword Broken Sword Elendil broke beneath fell. It treasured heirs heirlooms lost; spoken old among us made Ring, Isildur’s Bane, found. Now seen sword sought, would ask? Do wish House Elendil return Land Gondor?’ ‘I sent beg boon, seek meaning riddle,’ answered Boromir proudly. ‘Yet hard pressed, Sword Elendil would help beyond hope – thing could indeed return shadows past.’ He looked Aragorn, doubt eyes. Frodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently side. Evidently annoyed friend’s behalf. Standing suddenly burst out: All gold glitter, Not wander lost; The old strong wither, Deep roots reached frost. From ashes fire shall woken, A light shadows shall spring; Renewed shall blade broken: The crownless shall king. ‘Not good perhaps, point – need beyond word Elrond. If worth journey hundred ten days hear, best listen it.’ He sat snort. ‘I made myself,’ whispered Frodo, ‘for Du´nadan, long time ago first told himself. I almost wish adventures over, I could go day comes.’ Aragorn smiled him; turned Boromir again. ‘For part I forgive doubt,’ said. ‘Little I resemble figures Elendil Isildur stand carven majesty halls Denethor. I heir Isildur, Isildur himself. I hard life long; leagues lie Gondor small part count journeys. I crossed many mountains many rivers, trodden many plains, even far countries Rhuˆn Harad stars strange. ‘But home, I have, North. For heirs Valandil ever dwelt long line unbroken father unto son many generations. Our days darkened, dwindled; ever Sword passed new keeper. And I say you, Boromir, ere I end. Lonely men we, Rangers wild, hunters – hunters ever servants Enemy; found many places, Mordor only. ‘If Gondor, Boromir, stalwart tower, played another part. Many evil things strong walls bright swords stay. You know little lands beyond bounds. Peace freedom, say? The North would known little us. Fear would destroyed them. But dark things come houseless hills, creep sunless woods, fly us. What roads would dare tread, safety would quiet lands, homes simple men night, Du´nedain asleep, gone grave? ‘And yet less thanks you. Travellers scowl us, countrymen give us scornful names. ‘‘Strider’’ I one fat man lives within day’s march foes would freeze heart, lay little town ruin, guarded ceaselessly. Yet would otherwise. If simple folk free care fear, simple be, must secret keep so. That task kindred, years lengthened grass grown. ‘But world changing again. A new hour comes. Isildur’s Bane found. Battle hand. The Sword shall reforged. I come Minas Tirith.’ ‘Isildur’s Bane found, say,’ said Boromir. ‘I seen bright ring Halfling’s hand; Isildur perished ere age world began, say. How Wise know ring his? And passed years, brought hither strange messenger?’ ‘That shall told,’ said Elrond. ‘But yet, I beg, Master!’ cried Bilbo. ‘Already Sun climbing noon, I feel need something strengthen me.’ ‘I named you,’ said Elrond smiling. ‘But I now. Come! Tell us tale. And yet cast story verse, may tell plain words. The briefer, sooner shall refreshed.’ ‘Very well,’ said Bilbo. ‘I bid. But I tell true story, heard tell otherwise’ – looked sidelong Glo´in – ‘I ask forget forgive me. I wished claim treasure days, rid name thief put me. But perhaps I understand things little better now. Anyway, happened.’ To Bilbo’s tale wholly new, listened amazement old hobbit, actually displeased, recounted adventure Gollum, full length. He omit single riddle. He would given also account party disappearance Shire, allowed; Elrond raised hand. ‘Well told, friend,’ said, ‘but enough time. For moment suffices know Ring passed Frodo, heir. Let speak!’ Then, less willingly Bilbo, Frodo told dealings Ring day passed keeping. Every step journey Hobbiton Ford Bruinen questioned considered, everything could recall concerning Black Riders examined. At last sat again. ‘Not bad,’ Bilbo said him. ‘You would made good story it, hadn’t kept interrupting. I tried make notes, shall go together time, I write up. There whole chapters stuff ever got here!’ ‘Yes, made quite long tale,’ answered Frodo. ‘But story still seem complete me. I still want know good deal, especially Gandalf.’ Galdor Havens, sat nearby, overheard him. ‘You speak also,’ cried, turning Elrond said: ‘The Wise may good reason believe halfling’s trove indeed Great Ring long debate, unlikely though may seem know less. But may hear proofs? And I would ask also. What Saruman? He learned lore Rings, yet among us. What counsel – knows things heard?’ ‘The questions ask, Galdor, bound together,’ said Elrond. ‘I overlooked them, shall answered. But things part Gandalf make clear; I call upon last, place honour, matter chief.’ ‘Some, Galdor,’ said Gandalf, ‘would think tidings Glo´in, pursuit Frodo, proof enough halfling’s trove thing great worth Enemy. Yet ring. What then? The Nine Nazguˆl keep. The Seven taken destroyed.’ At Glo´in stirred, speak. ‘The Three know of. What one desires much? ‘There indeed wide waste time River Mountain, loss finding. But gap knowledge Wise filled last. Yet slowly. For Enemy close behind, closer even I feared. And well year, summer, seems, learn full truth. ‘Some remember many years ago I dared pass doors Necromancer Dol Guldur, secretly explored ways, found thus fears true: none Sauron, Enemy old, length taking shape power again. Some, too, remember also Saruman dissuaded us open deeds him, long watched only. Yet last, shadow grew, Saruman yielded, Council put forth strength drove evil Mirkwood – year finding Ring: strange chance, chance was. ‘But late, Elrond foresaw. Sauron also watched us, long prepared stroke, governing Mordor afar Minas Morgul, Nine servants dwelt, ready. Then gave way us, feigned flee, soon came Dark Tower openly declared himself. Then last time Council met; learned seeking ever eagerly One. We feared news knew nothing of. But Saruman said nay, repeated said us before: One would never found Middle-earth. ‘‘‘At worst,’’ said he, ‘‘our Enemy knows not, still lost. But lost may yet found, thinks. Fear not! His hope cheat him. Have I earnestly studied matter? Into Anduin Great fell; long ago, Sauron slept, rolled River Sea. There let lie End.’’’ Gandalf fell silent, gazing eastward porch far peaks Misty Mountains, whose great roots peril world long lain hidden. He sighed. ‘There I fault,’ said. ‘I lulled words Saruman Wise; I sought truth sooner, peril would less.’ ‘We fault,’ said Elrond, ‘and vigilance Darkness, maybe, would already upon us. But say on!’ ‘From first heart misgave me, reason I knew,’ said Gandalf, ‘and I desired know thing came Gollum, long possessed it. So I set watch him, guessing would ere long come forth darkness seek treasure. He came, escaped found. And alas! I let matter rest, watching waiting only, often done. ‘Time passed many cares, doubts awakened sudden fear. Whence came hobbit’s ring? What, fear true, done it? Those things I must decide. But I spoke yet dread none, knowing peril untimely whisper, went astray. In long wars Dark Tower treason ever greatest foe. ‘That seventeen years ago. Soon I became aware spies many sorts, even beasts birds, gathered round Shire, fear grew. I called help Du´nedain, watch doubled; I opened heart Aragorn, heir Isildur.’ ‘And I,’ said Aragorn, ‘counselled hunt Gollum, late though may seem. And since seemed fit Isildur’s heir labour repair Isildur’s fault, I went Gandalf long hopeless search.’ Then Gandalf told explored whole length Wilderland, even Mountains Shadow fences Mordor. ‘There rumour him, guess dwelt long dark hills; never found him, last I despaired. And despair I thought test might make finding Gollum unneeded. The ring might tell One. The memory words Council came back me: words Saruman, half-heeded time. I heard clearly heart. ‘‘‘The Nine, Seven, Three,’’ said, ‘‘had proper gem. Not One. It round unadorned, one lesser rings; maker set marks upon skilled, maybe, could still see read.’’ ‘What marks said. Who would know? The maker. And Saruman? But great though lore may be, must source. What hand save Sauron’s ever held thing, ere lost? The hand Isildur alone. ‘With thought, I forsook chase, passed swiftly Gondor. In former days members order well received there, Saruman all. Often long guest Lords City. Less welcome Lord Denethor show old, grudgingly permitted search among hoarded scrolls books. ‘‘‘If indeed look only, say, records ancient days, beginnings City, read on!’’ said. ‘‘For less dark come, care. But unless skill even Saruman, studied long, find naught well known me, master lore City.’’ ‘So said Denethor. And yet lie hoards many records even lore-masters read, scripts tongues become dark later men. And Boromir, lies Minas Tirith still, unread, I guess, save Saruman since kings failed, scroll Isildur made himself. For Isildur march away straight war Mordor, told tale.’ ‘Some North, maybe,’ Boromir broke in. ‘All know Gondor went first Minas Anor dwelt nephew Meneldil, instructing him, committed rule South Kingdom. In time planted last sapling White Tree memory brother.’ ‘But time also made scroll,’ said Gandalf; ‘and remembered Gondor, would seem. For scroll concerns Ring, thus wrote Isildur therein: The Great Ring shall go heirloom North Kingdom; records shall left Gondor, also dwell heirs Elendil, lest time come memory great matters shall grow dim. ‘And words Isildur described Ring, found it. It hot I first took it, hot glede, hand scorched, I doubt ever I shall free pain it. Yet even I write cooled, seemeth shrink, though loseth neither beauty shape. Already writing upon it, first clear red flame, fadeth barely read. It fashioned elven-script Eregion, letters Mordor subtle work; language unknown me. I deem tongue Black Land, since foul uncouth. What evil saith I know; I trace copy it, lest fade beyond recall. The Ring misseth, maybe, heat Sauron’s hand, black yet burned like fire, Gil-galad destroyed; maybe gold made hot again, writing would refreshed. But part I risk hurt thing: works Sauron fair. It precious me, though I buy great pain. ‘When I read words, quest ended. For traced writing indeed Isildur guessed, tongue Mordor servants Tower. And said therein already known. For day Sauron first put One, Celebrimbor, maker Three, aware him, afar heard speak words, evil purposes revealed. ‘At I took leave Denethor, even I went northwards, messages came Lo´rien Aragorn passed way, found creature called Gollum. Therefore I went first meet hear tale. Into deadly perils gone alone I dared guess.’ ‘There little need tell them,’ said Aragorn. ‘If man must needs walk sight Black Gate, tread deadly flowers Morgul Vale, perils have. I, too, despaired last, I began homeward journey. And then, fortune, I came suddenly I sought: marks soft feet beside muddy pool. But trail fresh swift, led Mordor away. Along skirts Dead Marshes I followed it, I him. Lurking stagnant mere, peering water dark eve fell, I caught him, Gollum. He covered green slime. He never love me, I fear; bit me, I gentle. Nothing I ever get mouth marks teeth. I deemed worst part journey, road back, watching day night, making walk halter neck, gagged, tamed lack drink food, driving ever towards Mirkwood. I brought last gave Elves, agreed done; I glad rid company, stank. For part I hope never look upon again; Gandalf came endured long speech him.’ ‘Yes, long weary,’ said Gandalf, ‘but without profit. For one thing, tale told loss agreed Bilbo told openly first time; mattered little, since I already guessed it. But I learned first Gollum’s ring came Great River nigh Gladden Fields. And I learned also possessed long. Many lives small kind. The power ring lengthened years far beyond span; power Great Rings wield. ‘And proof enough, Galdor, test I spoke of. Upon ring seen held aloft, round unadorned, letters Isildur reported may still read, one strength set golden thing fire while. That I done, I read: Ash nazg durbatuluˆk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatuluˆk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.’ The change wizard’s voice astounding. Suddenly became menacing, powerful, harsh stone. A shadow seemed pass high sun, porch moment grew dark. All trembled, Elves stopped ears. ‘Never voice dared utter words tongue Imladris, Gandalf Grey,’ said Elrond, shadow passed company breathed more. ‘And let us hope none ever speak again,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Nonetheless I ask pardon, Master Elrond. For tongue soon heard every corner West, let put doubt aside thing indeed Wise declared: treasure Enemy, fraught malice; lies great part strength old. Out Black Years come words Smiths Eregion heard, knew betrayed: One Ring rule all, One Ring find them, One Ring bring Darkness bind them. ‘Know also, friends, I learned yet Gollum. He loth speak tale unclear, beyond doubt went Mordor, knew forced him. Thus Enemy knows One found, long Shire; since servants pursued almost door, soon know, already may know, even I speak, here.’ All sat silent while, length Boromir spoke. ‘He small thing, say, Gollum? Small, great mischief. What became him? To doom put him?’ ‘He prison, worse,’ said Aragorn. ‘He suffered much. There doubt tormented, fear Sauron lies black heart. Still I one glad safely kept watchful Elves Mirkwood. His malice great gives strength hardly believed one lean withered. He could work much mischief still, free. And I doubt allowed leave Mordor evil errand.’ ‘Alas! alas!’ cried Legolas, fair Elvish face great distress. ‘The tidings I sent bring must told. They good, I learned evil may seem company. Sme´agol, called Gollum, escaped.’ ‘Escaped?’ cried Aragorn. ‘That ill news indeed. We shall rue bitterly, I fear. How came folk Thranduil fail trust?’ ‘Not lack watchfulness,’ said Legolas; ‘but perhaps over-kindliness. And fear prisoner aid others, known doings could wish. We guarded creature day night, Gandalf’s bidding, much though wearied task. But Gandalf bade us hope still cure, heart keep ever dungeons earth, would fall back old black thoughts.’ ‘You less tender me,’ said Glo´in flash eyes, old memories stirred imprisonment deep places Elven-king’s halls. ‘Now come!’ said Gandalf. ‘Pray, interrupt, good Glo´in. That regrettable misunderstanding, long set right. If grievances stand Elves Dwarves brought here, may well abandon Council.’ Glo´in rose bowed, Legolas continued. ‘In days fair weather led Gollum woods; high tree standing alone far others liked climb. Often let mount highest branches, felt free wind; set guard tree’s foot. One day refused come down, guards mind climb him: learned trick clinging boughs feet well hands; sat tree far night. ‘It night summer, yet moonless starless, Orcs came us unawares. We drove time; many fierce, came mountains, unused woods. When battle over, found Gollum gone, guards slain taken. It seemed plain us attack made rescue, knew beforehand. How contrived cannot guess; Gollum cunning, spies Enemy many. The dark things weredriven year Dragon’s fall returned greater numbers, Mirkwood evil place, save realm maintained. ‘We failed recapture Gollum. We came trail among many Orcs, plunged deep Forest, going south. But ere long escaped skill, dared continue hunt; drawing nigh Dol Guldur,andthatisstillaveryevilplace;wedonotgothatway.’ ‘Well, well, gone,’ said Gandalf. ‘We time seek again. He must will. But may play part yet neither Sauron foreseen. ‘And I answer Galdor’s questions. What Saruman? What counsels us need? This tale I must tell full, Elrond heard yet, brief; bear must resolve. It last chapter Tale Ring, far yet gone. * * * ‘At end June I Shire, cloud anxiety mind, I rode southern borders little land; I foreboding danger, still hidden drawing near. There messages reached telling war defeat Gondor, I heard Black Shadow chill smote heart. But I found nothing save fugitives South; yet seemed sat fear would speak. I turned east north journeyed along Greenway; far Bree I came upon traveller sitting bank beside road grazing horse beside him. It Radagast Brown, one time dwelt Rhosgobel, near borders Mirkwood. He one order, I seen many year. ‘‘‘Gandalf!’’ cried. ‘‘I seeking you. But I stranger parts. All I knew might found wild region uncouth name Shire.’’ ‘‘‘Your information correct,’’ I said. ‘‘But put way, meet inhabitants. You near borders Shire now. And want me? It must pressing. You never traveller, unless driven great need.’’ ‘‘‘I urgent errand,’’ said. ‘‘My news evil.’’ Then looked him, hedges might ears. ‘‘Nazguˆl,’’ whispered. ‘‘The Nine abroad again. They crossed River secretly moving westward. They taken guise riders black.’’ ‘I knew I dreaded without knowing it. ‘‘‘The Enemy must great need purpose,’’ said Radagast; ‘‘but makes look distant desolate parts, I cannot guess.’’ ‘‘‘What mean?’’ said I. ‘‘‘I told wherever go Riders ask news land called Shire.’’ ‘‘‘The Shire,’’ I said; heart sank. For even Wise might fear withstand Nine, gathered together fell chieftain. A great king sorcerer old, wields deadly fear. ‘‘Who told you, sent you?’’ I asked. ‘‘‘Saruman White,’’ answered Radagast. ‘‘And told say feel need, help; must seek aid once, late.’’ ‘And message brought hope. For Saruman White greatest order. Radagast is, course, worthy Wizard, master shapes changes hue; much lore herbs beasts, birds especially friends. But Saruman long studied arts Enemy himself, thus often able forestall him. It devices Saruman drove Dol Guldur. It might found weapons would drive back Nine. ‘‘‘I go Saruman,’’ I said. ‘‘‘Then must go now,’’ said Radagast; ‘‘for I wasted time looking you, days running short. I told find Midsummer, here. Even set spot, hardly reach Nine discover land seek. I shall turn back once.’’ And mounted would ridden straight off. ‘‘‘Stay moment!’’ I said. ‘‘We shall need help, help things give it. Send messages beasts birds friends. Tell bring news anything bears matter Saruman Gandalf. Let messages sent Orthanc.’’ ‘‘‘I that,’’ said, rode Nine him. ‘I could follow there. I ridden far already day, I weary horse; I needed consider matters. I stayed night Bree, decided I time return Shire.

Against old allies policies avail us all. There hope left Elves dying Nu´menor. This one choice you, us. We may join Power. It would wise, Gandalf. There hope way.

We bide time, keep thoughts hearts, deploring maybe evils done way, approving high ultimate purpose: Knowledge, Rule, Order; things far striven vain accomplish, hindered rather helped weak idle friends.

But I would give it, nay, I would give even news you, I learn mind. You head Council, unmasked last. Well, choices are, seems, submit Sauron, yourself. I take neither.

And fear hope proved ill-founded. For hope founded fat man Bree; fear founded cunning Sauron. But fat men sell ale many calls answer; power Sauron still less fear makes it. But circle Isengard, trapped alone, easy think hunters fled fallen would falter Shire far away.’ ‘I saw you!’ cried Frodo. ‘You walking backwards forwards. The moon shone hair.’ Gandalf paused astonished looked him. ‘It dream,’ said Frodo, ‘but suddenly came back me. I quite forgotten it. It came time ago; I left Shire, I think.’ ‘Then late coming,’ said Gandalf, ‘as see. I evil plight. And know agree I seldom need, bear misfortune well. Gandalf Grey caught like fly spider’s treacherous web! Yet even subtle spiders may leave weak thread. ‘At first I feared, Saruman doubt intended, Radagast also fallen. Yet I caught hint anything wrong voice eye meeting. If I had, I never gone Isengard, I gone warily. So Saruman guessed, concealed mind deceived messenger.

But Saruman become evil, say, doom cannot long delayed.’’ ‘He set land Rohan ere dawn; I lengthened tale long. The rest must brief. In Rohan I found evil already work: lies Saruman; king land would listen warnings. He bade take horse gone; I chose one much liking, little his. I took best horse land, I never seen like him.’ ‘Then must noble beast indeed,’ said Aragorn; ‘and grieves many tidings might seem worse learn Sauron levies tribute. It last I land.’ ‘Nor now, I swear,’ said Boromir. ‘It lie comes Enemy. I know Men Rohan, true valiant, allies, dwelling still lands gave long ago.’ ‘The shadow Mordor lies distant lands,’ answered Aragorn. ‘Saruman fallen it. Rohan beset.

And without reason, horses Riddermark come fields North, far Shadow, race, masters, descended free days old.’ ‘True indeed!’ said Gandalf. ‘And one among might foaled morning world. The horses Nine cannot vie him; tireless, swift flowing wind. Shadowfax called him. By day coat glistens like silver; night like shade, passes unseen. Light footfall! Never man mounted him, I took I tamed him, speedily bore I reached Shire Frodo Barrow-downs, though I set Rohan set Hobbiton. ‘But fear grew I rode. Ever I came north I heard tidings Riders, though I gained day day, ever me. They divided forces, I learned: remained eastern borders, far Greenway, invaded Shire south. I came Hobbiton Frodo gone; I words old Gamgee. Many words point. He much say shortcomings new owners Bag End. ‘‘‘I can’t abide changes,’’ said he, ‘‘not time life, least changes worst.’’ ‘‘Changes worst,’’ repeated many times. ‘‘‘Worst bad word,’’ I said him, ‘‘and I hope live see it.’’ But amidst talk I gathered last Frodo left Hobbiton less week before, black horseman come Hill evening. Then I rode fear. I came Buckland found uproar, busy hive ants stirred stick. I came house Crickhollow, broken open empty; threshold lay cloak Frodo’s. Then hope left me, I wait gather news, I might comforted; I rode trail Riders. It hard follow, went many ways, I loss. But seemed one two ridden towards Bree; way I went, I thought words might said innkeeper. ‘‘‘Butterbur call him,’’ thought I. ‘‘If delay fault, I melt butter him. I roast old fool slow fire.’’ He expected less, saw face fell flat began melt spot.’ ‘What him?’ cried Frodo alarm. ‘He really kind us could.’ Gandalf laughed. ‘Don’t afraid!’ said. ‘I bite, I barked little. So overjoyed I news I got him, stopped quaking, I embraced old fellow. How happened I could guess, I learned Bree night before, gone morning Strider. ‘‘‘Strider!’’ I cried, shouting joy. ‘‘‘Yes, sir, I afraid so, sir,’’ said Butterbur, mistaking me. ‘‘He got them, spite I could do, took him. They behaved queer time here: wilful, might say.’’ ‘‘‘Ass! Fool! Thrice worthy beloved Barliman!’’ said I. ‘‘It’s best news I since Midsummer; it’s worth gold piece least. May beer laid enchantment surpassing excellence seven years!’’ said I. ‘‘Now I take night’s rest, first since I forgotten when.’’ ‘So I stayed night, wondering much become Riders; two yet news Bree, seemed. But night heard more. Five least came west, threw gates passed Bree like howling wind; Bree-folk still shivering expecting end world. I got dawn went them. ‘I know, seems clear happened. Their Captain remained secret away south Bree, two rode ahead village, four invaded Shire. But foiled Bree Crickhollow, returned Captain tidings, left Road unguarded while, except spies. The Captain sent eastward straight across country, rest rode along Road great wrath. ‘I galloped Weathertop like gale, I reached sundown second day Bree – me. They drew away me, felt coming anger dared face Sun sky. But closed round night, I besieged hill-top, old ring Amon Suˆl. I hard put indeed: light flame cannot seen Weathertop since war-beacons old. ‘At sunrise I escaped fled towards north. I could hope more. It impossible find you, Frodo, wilderness, would folly try Nine heels. So I trust Aragorn. But I hoped draw off, yet reach Rivendell ahead send help. Four Riders indeed follow me, turned back made Ford, seems. That helped little, five, nine, camp attacked. ‘I reached last long hard road, Hoarwell Ettenmoors, north. It took nearly fifteen days Weathertop, I could ride among rocks troll-fells, Shadowfax departed. I sent back master; great friendship grown us, I need come call. But I came Rivendell two days Ring, news peril already brought – proved well indeed. ‘And that, Frodo, end account. May Elrond others forgive length it. But thing happened before, Gandalf broke tryst come promised. An account Ring-bearer strange event required, I think. ‘Well, Tale told, first last. Here are, Ring. But yet come nearer purpose. What shall it?’ There silence. At last Elrond spoke again. ‘This grievous news concerning Saruman,’ said; ‘for trusted deep counsels. It perilous study deeply arts Enemy, good ill. But falls betrayals, alas, happened before. Of tales heard day tale Frodo strange me. I known hobbits, save Bilbo here; seems perhaps alone singular I thought him. The world changed much since I last westward roads. ‘The Barrow-wights know many names; Old Forest many tales told: remains outlier northern march. Time squirrel could go tree tree Shire Dunland west Isengard. In lands I journeyed once, many things wild strange I knew. But I forgotten Bombadil, indeed still walked woods hills long ago, even older old. That name. Iarwain Ben-adar called him, oldest fatherless. But many another name since given folk: Forn Dwarves, Orald Northern Men, names beside. He strange creature, maybe I summoned Council.’ ‘He would come,’ said Gandalf. ‘Could still send messages obtain help?’ asked Erestor. ‘It seems power even Ring.’ ‘No, I put so,’ said Gandalf. ‘Say rather Ring power him. He master. But cannot alter Ring itself, break power others. And withdrawn little land, within bounds set, though none see them, waiting perhaps change days, step beyond them.’ ‘But within bounds nothing seems dismay him,’ said Erestor. ‘Would take Ring keep there, ever harmless?’ ‘No,’ said Gandalf, ‘not willingly. He might so, free folk world begged him, would understand need. And given Ring, would soon forget it, likely throw away. Such things hold mind. He would unsafe guardian; alone answer enough.’ ‘But case,’ said Glorfindel, ‘to send Ring would postpone day evil. He far away. We could take back him, unguessed, unmarked spy. And even could, soon late Lord Rings would learn hiding place would bend power towards it. Could power defied Bombadil alone? I think not. I think end, else conquered, Bombadil fall, Last First; Night come.’ ‘I know little Iarwain save name,’ said Galdor; ‘but Glorfindel, I think, right. Power defy Enemy him, unless power earth itself. And yet see Sauron torture destroy hills. What power still remains lies us, Imladris, Cı´rdan Havens, Lo´rien. But strength, strength withstand Enemy, coming Sauron last, else overthrown?’ ‘I strength,’ said Elrond; ‘neither they.’ ‘Then Ring cannot kept ever strength,’ said Glorfindel, ‘two things remain us attempt: send Sea, destroy it.’ ‘But Gandalf revealed us cannot destroy craft possess,’ said Elrond. ‘And dwell beyond Sea would receive it: good ill belongs Middle-earth; us still dwell deal it.’ ‘Then,’ said Glorfindel, ‘let us cast deeps, make lies Saruman come true. For clear even Council feet already crooked path. He knew Ring lost ever, wished us think so; began lust himself. Yet oft lies truth hidden: Sea would safe.’ ‘Not safe ever,’ said Gandalf. ‘There many things deep waters; seas lands may change. And part take thought season, lives Men, passing age world. We seek final end menace, even hope make one.’ ‘And shall find roads Sea,’ said Galdor. ‘If return Iarwain thought dangerous, flight Sea fraught gravest peril. My heart tells Sauron expect us take western way, learns befallen. He soon will. The Nine unhorsed indeed, respite, ere find new steeds swifter. Only waning might Gondor stands march power along coasts North; comes, assailing White Towers Havens, hereafter Elves may escape lengthening shadows Middleearth.’ ‘Long yet march delayed,’ said Boromir. ‘Gondor wanes, say. But Gondor stands, even end strength still strong.’ ‘And yet vigilance longer keep back Nine,’ said Galdor. ‘And roads may find Gondor guard.’ ‘Then,’ said Erestor, ‘there two courses, Glorfindel already declared: hide Ring ever; unmake it. But beyond power. Who read riddle us?’ ‘None so,’ said Elrond gravely. ‘At least none foretell come pass, take road that. But seems clear road must take. The westward road seems easiest. Therefore must shunned. It watched. Too often Elves fled way. Now last must take hard road, road unforeseen. There lies hope, hope be. To walk peril – Mordor. We must send Ring Fire.’ Silence fell again. Frodo, even fair house, looking upon sunlit valley filled noise clear waters, felt dead darkness heart. Boromir stirred, Frodo looked him. He fingering great horn frowning. At length spoke. ‘I understand this,’ said. ‘Saruman traitor, glimpse wisdom? Why speak ever hiding destroying? Why think Great Ring come hands serve us hour need? Wielding Free Lords Free may surely defeat Enemy. That fears, I deem. ‘The Men Gondor valiant, never submit; may beaten down. Valour needs first strength, weapon. Let Ring weapon, power say. Take go forth victory!’ ‘Alas, no,’ said Elrond. ‘We cannot use Ruling Ring. That know well. It belongs Sauron made alone, altogether evil. Its strength, Boromir, great anyone wield will, save already great power own. But holds even deadlier peril. The desire corrupts heart. Consider Saruman. If Wise Ring overthrow Lord Mordor, using arts, would set Sauron’s throne, yet another Dark Lord would appear. And another reason Ring destroyed: long world danger even Wise. For nothing evil beginning. Even Sauron so. I fear take Ring hide it. I take Ring wield it.’ ‘Nor I,’ said Gandalf. Boromir looked doubtfully, bowed head. ‘So it,’ said. ‘Then Gondor must trust weapons have. And least, Wise ones guard Ring, fight on. Mayhap Sword-thatwas-Broken may still stem tide – hand wields inherited heirloom only, sinews Kings Men.’ ‘Who tell?’ said Aragorn. ‘But put test one day.’ ‘May day long delayed,’ said Boromir. ‘For though I ask aid, need it. It would comfort us know others fought also means have.’ ‘Then comforted,’ said Elrond. ‘For powers realms know not, hidden you. Anduin Great flows past many shores, ere comes Argonath Gates Gondor.’ ‘Still might well all,’ said Glo´in Dwarf, ‘if strengths joined, powers used league. Other rings may be, less treacherous, might used need. The Seven lost us – Balin found ring Thro´r, last; naught heard since Thro´r perished Moria. Indeed I may reveal partly hope find ring Balin went away.’ ‘Balin find ring Moria,’ said Gandalf. ‘Thro´r gave Thra´in son, Thra´in Thorin. It taken torment Thra´in dungeons Dol Guldur. I came late.’ ‘Ah, alas!’ cried Glo´in. ‘When day come revenge? But still Three. What Three Rings Elves? Very mighty Rings, said. Do Elf-lords keep them? Yet made Dark Lord long ago. Are idle? I see Elf-lords here. Will say?’ The Elves returned answer. ‘Did hear me, Glo´in?’ said Elrond. ‘The Three made Sauron, ever touch them. But permitted speak. So much hour doubt I may say. They idle. But made weapons war conquest: power. Those made desire strength domination hoarded wealth, understanding, making, healing, preserve things unstained. These things Elves Middle-earth measure gained, though sorrow. But wrought wield Three turn undoing, minds hearts become revealed Sauron, regains One. It would better Three never been. That purpose.’ ‘But would happen, Ruling Ring destroyed, counsel?’ asked Glo´in. ‘We know certain,’ answered Elrond sadly. ‘Some hope Three Rings, Sauron never touched, would become free, rulers might heal hurts world wrought. But maybe One gone, Three fail, many fair things fade forgotten. That belief.’ ‘Yet Elves willing endure chance,’ said Glorfindel, ‘if power Sauron may broken, fear dominion taken away ever.’ ‘Thus return destroying Ring,’ said Erestor, ‘and yet come nearer. What strength finding Fire made? That path despair. Of folly I would say, long wisdom Elrond forbid me.’ ‘Despair, folly?’ said Gandalf. ‘It despair, despair see end beyond doubt. We not. It wisdom recognize necessity, courses weighed, though folly may appear cling false hope. Well, let folly cloak, veil eyes Enemy! For wise, weighs things nicety scales malice. But measure knows desire, desire power; judges hearts. Into heart thought enter refuse it, Ring may seek destroy it. If seek this, shall put reckoning.’ ‘At least while,’ said Elrond. ‘The road must trod, hard. And neither strength wisdom carry us far upon it. This quest may attempted weak much hope strong. Yet oft course deeds move wheels world: small hands must, eyes great elsewhere.’ ‘Very well, well, Master Elrond!’ said Bilbo suddenly. ‘Say more! It plain enough pointing at. Bilbo silly hobbit started affair, Bilbo better finish it, himself. I comfortable here, getting book. If want know, I writing ending it. I thought putting: lived happily ever afterwards end days. It good ending, none worse used before. Now I shall alter that: look like coming true; anyway evidently several chapters, I live write them. It frightful nuisance. When ought I start?’ Boromir looked surprise Bilbo, laughter died lips saw others regarded old hobbit grave respect. Only Glo´in smiled, smile came old memories. ‘Of course, dear Bilbo,’ said Gandalf. ‘If really started affair, might expected finish it. But know well enough starting great claim any, small part played great deeds hero. You need bow! Though word meant, doubt jest making valiant offer. But one beyond strength, Bilbo. You cannot take thing back. It passed on. If need advice longer, I say part ended, unless recorder. Finish book, leave ending unaltered! There still hope it. But get ready write sequel, come back.’ Bilbo laughed. ‘I never known give pleasant advice before,’ said. ‘As unpleasant advice good, I wonder advice bad. Still, I don’t suppose I strength luck left deal Ring. It grown, I not. But tell me: mean they?’ ‘The messengers sent Ring.’ ‘Exactly! And be? That seems Council decide, decide. Elves may thrive speech alone, Dwarves endure great weariness; I old hobbit, I miss meal noon. Can’t think names now? Or put till dinner?’ No one answered. The noon-bell rang. Still one spoke. Frodo glanced faces, turned him. All Council sat downcast eyes, deep thought. A great dread fell him, awaiting pronouncement doom long foreseen vainly hoped might never spoken. An overwhelming longing rest remain peace Bilbo’s side Rivendell filled heart. At last effort spoke, wondered hear words, using small voice. ‘I take Ring,’ said, ‘though I know way.’ * * * Elrond raised eyes looked him, Frodo felt heart pierced sudden keenness glance. ‘If I understand aright I heard,’ said, ‘I think task appointed you, Frodo; find way, one will. This hour Shire-folk, arise quiet fields shake towers counsels Great. Who Wise could foreseen it? Or, wise, expect know it, hour struck? ‘But heavy burden. So heavy none could lay another. I lay you. But take freely, I say choice right; though mighty Elf-friends old, Hador, Hu´rin, Tu´rin, Beren assembled together, seat among them.’ ‘But won’t send alone surely, Master?’ cried Sam, unable contain longer, jumping corner quietly sitting floor. ‘No indeed!’ said Elrond, turning towards smile. ‘You least shall go him. It hardly possible separate him, even summoned secret council not.’ Sam sat down, blushing muttering. ‘A nice pickle landed in, Mr. Frodo!’ said, shaking head. Chapter 3 THE RING GOES SOUTH Later day hobbits held meeting Bilbo’s room. Merry Pippin indignant heard Sam crept Council, chosen Frodo’s companion. ‘It’s unfair,’ said Pippin. ‘Instead throwing out, clapping chains, Elrond goes rewards cheek!’ ‘Rewards!’ said Frodo. ‘I can’t imagine severe punishment. You thinking saying: condemned go hopeless journey, reward? Yesterday I dreamed task done, I could rest here, long while, perhaps good.’ ‘I don’t wonder,’ said Merry, ‘and I wish could. But envying Sam, you. If go, punishment us left behind, even Rivendell. We come long way stiff times. We want go on.’ ‘That’s I meant,’ said Pippin. ‘We hobbits ought stick together, will. I shall go, unless chain up. There must someone intelligence party.’ ‘Then certainly chosen, Peregrin Took!’ said Gandalf, looking window, near ground. ‘But worrying unnecessarily. Nothing decided yet.’ ‘Nothing decided!’ cried Pippin. ‘Then doing? You shut hours.’ ‘Talking,’ said Bilbo. ‘There deal talk, everyone eye-opener. Even old Gandalf. I think Legolas’s bit news Gollum caught even hop, though passed off.’ ‘You wrong,’ said Gandalf. ‘You inattentive. I already heard Gwaihir. If want know, real eye-openers, put it, Frodo; I one surprised.’ ‘Well, anyway,’ said Bilbo, ‘nothing decided beyond choosing poor Frodo Sam. I afraid time might come that, I let off. But ask me, Elrond send fair number, reports come in. Have started yet, Gandalf?’ ‘Yes,’ said wizard. ‘Some scouts sent already. More go tomorrow. Elrond sending Elves, get touch Rangers, maybe Thranduil’s folk Mirkwood. And Aragorn gone Elrond’s sons. We shall scour lands round many long leagues move made. So cheer up, Frodo! You probably make quite long stay here.’ ‘Ah!’ said Sam gloomily. ‘We’ll wait long enough winter come.’ ‘That can’t helped,’ said Bilbo. ‘It’s fault partly, Frodo lad: insisting waiting birthday. A funny way honouring it, I can’t help thinking. Not day I chosen letting S.-B.s Bag End. But is: can’t wait till spring; can’t go till reports come back. When winter first begins bite stones crack frosty night, pools black trees bare, ’tis evil Wild fare. But I afraid luck.’ ‘I afraid will,’ said Gandalf. ‘We can’t start found Riders.’ ‘I thought destroyed flood,’ said Merry. ‘You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,’ said Gandalf. ‘The power master them, stand fall him. We hope unhorsed unmasked, made less dangerous; must find certain. In meantime try forget troubles, Frodo. I know I anything help you; I whisper ears. Someone said intelligence would needed party. He right. I think I shall come you.’ So great Frodo’s delight announcement Gandalf left window-sill, sitting, took hat bowed. ‘I said I think I shall come. Do count anything yet. In matter Elrond much say, friend Strider. Which reminds me, I want see Elrond. I must off.’ ‘How long think I shall here?’ said Frodo Bilbo Gandalf gone. ‘Oh, I don’t know. I can’t count days Rivendell,’ said Bilbo. ‘But quite long, I think. We many good talk. What helping book, making start next? Have thought ending?’ ‘Yes, several, dark unpleasant,’ said Frodo. ‘Oh, won’t do!’ said Bilbo. ‘Books ought good endings. How would do: settled lived together happily ever after?’ ‘It well, ever comes that,’ said Frodo. ‘Ah!’ said Sam. ‘And live? That’s I often wonder.’ For hobbits continued talk think past journey perils lay ahead; virtue land Rivendell soon fear anxiety lifted minds. The future, good ill, forgotten, ceased power present. Health hope grew strong them, content good day came, taking pleasure every meal, every word song. So days slipped away, morning dawned bright fair, evening followed cool clear. But autumn waning fast; slowly golden light faded pale silver, lingering leaves fell naked trees. A wind began blow chill Misty Mountains east. The Hunter’s Moon waxed round night sky, put flight lesser stars. But low South one star shone red. Every night, Moon waned again, shone brighter brighter. Frodo could see window, deep heavens, burning like watchful eye glared trees brink valley. The hobbits nearly two months house Elrond, November gone last shreds autumn, December passing, scouts began return. Some gone north beyond springs Hoarwell Ettenmoors; others gone west, help Aragorn Rangers searched lands far Greyflood, far Tharbad, old North Road crossed river ruined town. Many gone east south; crossed Mountains entered Mirkwood, others climbed pass sources Gladden River, come Wilderland Gladden Fields length reached old home Radagast Rhosgobel. Radagast there; returned high pass called Redhorn Gate. The sons Elrond, Elladan Elrohir, last return; made great journey, passing Silverlode strange country, errand would speak save Elrond. In region messengers discovered signs tidings Riders servants Enemy. Even Eagles Misty Mountains learned fresh news. Nothing seen heard Gollum; wild wolves still gathering, hunting far Great River. Three black horses found drowned flooded Ford. On rocks rapids searchers discovered bodies five more, also long black cloak, slashed tattered. Of Black Riders trace seen, nowhere presence felt. It seemed vanished North. ‘Eight Nine accounted least,’ said Gandalf. ‘It rash sure, yet I think may hope Ringwraiths scattered, obliged return best could Master Mordor, empty shapeless. ‘If so, time begin hunt again. Of course Enemy servants, journey way borders Rivendell pick trail. And careful hard find. But must delay longer.’ Elrond summoned hobbits him. He looked gravely Frodo. ‘The time come,’ said. ‘If Ring set out, must go soon. But go must count errand aided war force. They must pass domain Enemy far aid. Do still hold word, Frodo, Ring-bearer?’ ‘I do,’ said Frodo. ‘I go Sam.’ ‘Then I cannot help much, even counsel,’ said Elrond. ‘I foresee little road; task achieved I know. The Shadow crept feet Mountains, draws nigh even borders Greyflood; Shadow dark me. You meet many foes, open, disguised; may find friends upon way least look it. I send messages, I contrive, I know wide world; perilous lands become may well miscarry, come quicker yourself. ‘And I choose companions go you, far fortune allows. The number must few, since hope speed secrecy. Had I host Elves armour Elder Days, would avail little, save arouse power Mordor. ‘The Company Ring shall Nine; Nine Walkers shall set Nine Riders evil. With faithful servant, Gandalf go; shall great task, maybe end labours. ‘For rest, shall represent Free Peoples World: Elves, Dwarves, Men. Legolas shall Elves; Gimli son Glo´in Dwarves. They willing go least passes Mountains, maybe beyond. For men shall Aragorn son Arathorn, Ring Isildur concerns closely.’ ‘Strider!’ cried Frodo. ‘Yes,’ said smile. ‘I ask leave companion, Frodo.’ ‘I would begged come,’ said Frodo, ‘only I thought going Minas Tirith Boromir.’ ‘I am,’ said Aragorn. ‘And Sword-that-was-Broken shall re-forged ere I set war. But road road lie together many hundreds miles. Therefore Boromir also Company. He valiant man.’ ‘There remain two found,’ said Elrond. ‘These I consider. Of household I may find seems good send.’ ‘But leave place us!’ cried Pippin dismay. ‘We don’t want left behind. We want go Frodo.’ ‘That understand cannot imagine lies ahead,’ said Elrond. ‘Neither Frodo,’ said Gandalf, unexpectedly supporting Pippin. ‘Nor us see clearly. It true hobbits understood danger, would dare go. But would still wish go, wish dared, shamed unhappy. I think, Elrond, matter would well trust rather friendship great wisdom. Even chose us Elf-lord, Glorfindel, could storm Dark Tower, open road Fire power him.’ ‘You speak gravely,’ said Elrond, ‘but I doubt. The Shire, I forebode, free peril; two I thought send back messengers, could, according fashion country, warn people danger. In case, I judge younger two, Peregrin Took, remain. My heart going.’ ‘Then, Master Elrond, lock prison, send home tied sack,’ said Pippin. ‘For otherwise I shall follow Company.’ ‘Let then. You shall go,’ said Elrond, sighed. ‘Now tale Nine filled. In seven days Company must depart.’ The Sword Elendil forged anew Elvish smiths, blade traced device seven stars set crescent Moon rayed Sun, written many runes; Aragorn son Arathorn going war upon marches Mordor. Very bright sword made whole again; light sun shone redly it, light moon shone cold, edge hard keen. And Aragorn gave new name called Andu´ril, Flame West. Aragorn Gandalf walked together sat speaking road perils would meet; pondered storied figured maps books lore house Elrond. Sometimes Frodo them; content lean guidance, spent much time could Bilbo. In last days hobbits sat together evening Hall Fire, among many tales heard told full lay Beren Lu´thien winning Great Jewel; day, Merry Pippin about, Frodo Sam found Bilbo small room. Then Bilbo would read passages book (which still seemed incomplete), scraps verses, would take notes Frodo’s adventures. On morning last day Frodo alone Bilbo, old hobbit pulled bed wooden box. He lifted lid fumbled inside. ‘Here sword,’ said. ‘But broken, know. I took keep safe I’ve forgotten ask smiths could mend it. No time now. So I thought, perhaps, would care this, don’t know?’ He took box small sword old shabby leathern scabbard. Then drew it, polished well-tended blade glittered suddenly, cold bright. ‘This Sting,’ said, thrust little effort deep wooden beam. ‘Take it, like. I shan’t want again, I expect.’ Frodo accepted gratefully. ‘Also this!’ said Bilbo, bringing parcel seemed rather heavy size. He unwound several folds old cloth, held small shirt mail. It close-woven many rings, supple almost linen, cold ice, harder steel. It shone like moonlit silver, studded white gems. With belt pearl crystal. ‘It’s pretty thing, isn’t it?’ said Bilbo, moving light. ‘And useful. It dwarf-mail Thorin gave me. I got back Michel Delving I started, packed luggage. I brought mementoes Journey away me, except Ring. But I expect use this, I don’t need now, except look sometimes. You hardly feel weight put on.’ ‘I look – well, I don’t think I look right it,’ said Frodo. ‘Just I said myself,’ said Bilbo. ‘But never mind looks. You wear outer clothes. Come on! You must share secret me. Don’t tell anybody else! But I feel happier I knew wearing it. I fancy would turn even knives Black Riders,’ ended low voice. ‘Very well, I take it,’ said Frodo. Bilbo put him, fastened Sting upon glittering belt; Frodo put top old weather-stained breeches, tunic, jacket. ‘Just plain hobbit look,’ said Bilbo. ‘But appears surface. Good luck you!’ He turned away looked window, trying hum tune. ‘I cannot thank I should, Bilbo, this, past kindnesses,’ said Frodo. ‘Don’t try!’ said old hobbit, turning round slapping back. ‘Ow!’ cried. ‘You hard slap! But are: Hobbits must stick together, especially Bagginses. All I ask return is: take much care can, bring back news can, old songs tales come by. I’ll best finish book return. I like write second book, I spared.’ He broke turned window again, singing softly. I sit beside fire think I seen, meadow-flowers butterflies summers been; Of yellow leaves gossamer autumns were, morning mist silver sun wind upon hair. I sit beside fire think world winter comes without spring I shall ever see. For still many things I never seen: every wood every spring different green. I sit beside fire think people long ago, people see world I shall never know. But I sit think times before, I listen returning feet voices door. It cold grey day near end December. The East Wind streaming bare branches trees, seething dark pines hills. Ragged clouds hurrying overhead, dark low. As cheerless shadows early evening began fall Company made ready set out. They start dusk, Elrond counselled journey cover night often could, far Rivendell. ‘You fear many eyes servants Sauron,’ said. ‘I doubt news discomfiture Riders already reached him, filled wrath. Soon spies foot wing abroad northern lands. Even sky must beware go way.’ The Company took little gear war, hope secrecy battle. Aragorn Andu´ril weapon, went forth clad rusty green brown, Ranger wilderness. Boromir long sword, fashion like Andu´ril less lineage, bore also shield war-horn. ‘Loud clear sounds valleys hills,’ said, ‘and let foes Gondor flee!’ Putting lips blew blast, echoes leapt rock rock, heard voice Rivendell sprang feet. ‘Slow wind horn again, Boromir,’ said Elrond, ‘until stand borders land, dire need you.’ ‘Maybe,’ said Boromir. ‘But always I let horn cry setting forth, though thereafter may walk shadows, I go forth thief night.’ Gimli dwarf alone wore openly short shirt steelrings, dwarves make light burdens; belt broad-bladed axe. Legolas bow quiver, belt long white knife. The younger hobbits wore swords taken barrow; Frodo took Sting; mail-coat, Bilbo wished, remained hidden. Gandalf bore staff, girt side elven-sword Glamdring, mate Orcrist lay upon breast Thorin Lonely Mountain. All well furnished Elrond thick warm clothes, jackets cloaks lined fur. Spare food clothes blankets needs laden pony, none poor beast brought Bree. The stay Rivendell worked great wonder change him: glossy seemed vigour youth. It Sam insisted choosing him, declaring Bill (as called him) would pine, come. ‘That animal nearly talk,’ said, ‘and would talk, stayed much longer. He gave look plain Mr. Pippin could speak it: don’t let go you, Sam, I’ll follow own.’ So Bill going beast burden, yet member Company seem depressed. Their farewells said great hall fire, waiting Gandalf, yet come house. A gleam firelight came open doors, soft lights glowing many windows. Bilbo huddled cloak stood silent doorstep beside Frodo. Aragorn sat head bowed knees; Elrond knew fully hour meant him. The others could seen grey shapes darkness. Sam standing pony, sucking teeth, staring moodily gloom river roared stonily below; desire adventure lowest ebb. ‘Bill, lad,’ said, ‘you oughtn’t took us. You could stayed et best hay till new grass comes.’ Bill swished tail said nothing. Sam eased pack shoulders, went anxiously mind things stowed it, wondering forgotten anything: chief treasure, cooking gear; little box salt always carried refilled could; good supply pipe-weed (but near enough, I’ll warrant); flint tinder; woollen hose; linen; various small belongings master’s Frodo forgotten Sam stowed bring triumph called for. He went all. ‘Rope!’ muttered. ‘No rope! And last night said yourself: ‘‘Sam, bit rope? You’ll want it, haven’t got it.’’ Well, I’ll want it. I can’t get now.’ At moment Elrond came Gandalf, called Company him. ‘This last word,’ said low voice. ‘The Ring-bearer setting Quest Mount Doom. On alone charge laid: neither cast away Ring, deliver servant Enemy indeed let handle it, save members Company Council, gravest need. The others go free companions, help way. You may tarry, come back, turn aside paths, chance allows. The go, less easy withdraw; yet oath bond laid go will. For yet know strength hearts, cannot foresee may meet upon road.’ ‘Faithless says farewell road darkens,’ said Gimli. ‘Maybe,’ said Elrond, ‘but let vow walk dark, seen nightfall.’ ‘Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,’ said Gimli. ‘Or break it,’ said Elrond. ‘Look far ahead! But go good hearts! Farewell, may blessing Elves Men Free Folk go you. May stars shine upon faces!’ ‘Good ... good luck!’ cried Bilbo, stuttering cold. ‘I don’t suppose able keep diary, Frodo lad, I shall expect full account get back. And don’t long! Farewell!’ Many others Elrond’s household stood shadows watched go, bidding farewell soft voices. There laughter, song music. At last turned away faded silently dusk. They crossed bridge wound slowly long steep paths led cloven vale Rivendell; came length high moor wind hissed heather. Then one glance Last Homely House twinkling strode away far night. At Ford Bruinen left Road turning southwards went narrow paths among folded lands. Their purpose hold course west Mountains many miles days. The country much rougher barren green vale Great River Wilderland side range, going would slow; hoped way escape notice unfriendly eyes. The spies Sauron hitherto seldom seen empty country, paths little known except people Rivendell. Gandalf walked front, went Aragorn, knew land even dark. The others file behind, Legolas whose eyes keen rearguard. The first part journey hard dreary, Frodo remembered little it, save wind. For many sunless days icy blast came Mountains east, garment seemed able keep searching fingers. Though Company well clad, seldom felt warm, either moving rest. They slept uneasily middle day, hollow land, hidden tangled thorn-bushes grew thickets many places. In late afternoon roused watch, took chief meal: cold cheerless rule, could seldom risk lighting fire. In evening went again, always nearly southward could find way. At first seemed hobbits although walked stumbled weary, creeping forward like snails, getting nowhere. Each day land looked much day before. Yet steadily mountains drawing nearer. South Rivendell rose ever higher, bent westwards; feet main range tumbled ever wider land bleak hills, deep valleys filled turbulent waters. Paths winding, led often edge sheer fall, treacherous swamps. They fortnight way weather changed. The wind suddenly fell veered round south. The swift-flowing clouds lifted melted away, sun came out, pale bright. There came cold clear dawn end long stumbling night-march. The travellers reached low ridge crowned ancient hollytrees whose grey-green trunks seemed built stone hills. Their dark leaves shone berries glowed red light rising sun. Away south Frodo could see dim shapes lofty mountains seemed stand across path Company taking. At left high range rose three peaks; tallest nearest stood like tooth tipped snow; great, bare, northern precipice still largely shadow, sunlight slanted upon it, glowed red. Gandalf stood Frodo’s side looked hand. ‘We done well,’ said. ‘We reached borders country Men call Hollin; many Elves lived happier days, Eregion name. Five-andforty leagues crow flies come, though many long miles feet walked. The land weather milder now, perhaps dangerous.’ ‘Dangerous not, real sunrise mighty welcome,’ said Frodo, throwing back hood letting morning light fall face. ‘But mountains ahead us,’ said Pippin. ‘We must turned eastwards night.’ ‘No,’ said Gandalf. ‘But see ahead clear light. Beyond peaks range bends round south-west. There many maps Elrond’s house, I suppose never thought look them?’ ‘Yes I did, sometimes,’ said Pippin, ‘but I don’t remember them. Frodo better head sort thing.’ ‘I need map,’ said Gimli, come Legolas, gazing strange light deep eyes. ‘There land fathers worked old, wrought image mountains many works metal stone, many songs tales. They stand tall dreams: Baraz, Zirak, Shathuˆr. ‘Only I seen afar waking life, I know names, lies Khazad-duˆm, Dwarrowdelf, called Black Pit, Moria Elvish tongue. Yonder stands Barazinbar, Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; beyond Silvertine Cloudyhead: Celebdil White, Fanuidhol Grey, call Zirakzigil Bundushathuˆr. ‘There Misty Mountains divide, arms lies deep-shadowed valley cannot forget: Azanulbizar, Dimrill Dale, Elves call Nanduhirion.’ ‘It Dimrill Dale making,’ said Gandalf. ‘If climb pass called Redhorn Gate, far side Caradhras, shall come Dimrill Stair deep vale Dwarves. There lies Mirrormere, River Silverlode rises icy springs.’ ‘Dark water Kheled-zaˆram,’ said Gimli, ‘and cold springs Kibil-naˆla. My heart trembles thought I may see soon.’ ‘May joy sight, good dwarf!’ said Gandalf. ‘But whatever may do, least cannot stay valley. We must go Silverlode secret woods, Great River, then——’ He paused. ‘Yes, then?’ asked Merry. ‘To end journey – end,’ said Gandalf. ‘We cannot look far ahead. Let us glad first stage safely over. I think rest here, today tonight well. There wholesome air Hollin. Much evil must befall country wholly forgets Elves, dwelt there.’ ‘That true,’ said Legolas. ‘But Elves land race strange us silvan folk, trees grass remember them. Only I hear stones lament them: deep delved us, fair wrought us, high builded us; gone. They gone. They sought Havens long ago.’ That morning lit fire deep hollow shrouded great bushes holly, supper-breakfast merrier since set out. They hurry bed afterwards, expected night sleep in, mean go evening next day. Only Aragorn silent restless. After left Company wandered ridge; stood shadow tree, looking southwards westwards, head posed listening. Then returned brink dell looked others laughing talking. ‘What matter, Strider?’ Merry called up. ‘What looking for? Do miss East Wind?’ ‘No indeed,’ answered. ‘But I miss something. I country Hollin many seasons. No folk dwell now, many creatures live times, especially birds. Yet things silent. I feel it. There sound miles us, voices seem make ground echo. I understand it.’ Gandalf looked sudden interest. ‘But guess reason?’ asked. ‘Is surprise seeing four hobbits, mention rest us, people seldom seen heard?’ ‘I hope it,’ answered Aragorn. ‘But I sense watchfulness, fear, I never before.’ ‘Then must careful,’ said Gandalf. ‘If bring Ranger you, well pay attention him, especially Ranger Aragorn. We must stop talking aloud, rest quietly, set watch.’ It Sam’s turn day take first watch, Aragorn joined him. The others fell asleep. Then silence grew even Sam felt it. The breathing sleepers could plainly heard. The swish pony’s tail occasional movements feet became loud noises. Sam could hear joints creaking, stirred. Dead silence around him, hung clear blue sky, Sun rode East. Away South dark patch appeared, grew, drove north like flying smoke wind. ‘What’s that, Strider? It don’t look like cloud,’ said Sam whisper Aragorn. He made answer, gazing intently sky; long Sam could see approaching. Flocks birds, flying great speed, wheeling circling, traversing land searching something; steadily drawing nearer. ‘Lie flat still!’ hissed Aragorn, pulling Sam shade holly-bush; whole regiment birds broken away suddenly main host, came, flying low, straight towards ridge. Sam thought kind crow large size. As passed overhead, dense throng shadow followed darkly ground below, one harsh croak heard. Not dwindled distance, north west, sky clear would Aragorn rise. Then sprang went wakened Gandalf. ‘Regiments black crows flying land Mountains Greyflood,’ said, ‘and passed Hollin. They natives here; crebain Fangorn Dunland. I know about: possibly trouble away south fleeing; I think spying land. I also glimpsed many hawks flying high sky. I think ought move evening. Hollin longer wholesome us: watched.’ ‘And case Redhorn Gate,’ said Gandalf; ‘and get without seen, I cannot imagine. But think must. As moving soon dark, I afraid right.’ ‘Luckily fire made little smoke, burned low crebain came,’ said Aragorn. ‘It must put lit again.’ ‘Well isn’t plague nuisance!’ said Pippin. The news: fire, move night, broken him, soon woke late afternoon. ‘All pack crows! I looked forward real good meal tonight: something hot.’ ‘Well, go looking forward,’ said Gandalf. ‘There may many unexpected feasts ahead you. For I like pipe smoke comfort, warmer feet. However, certain one thing rate: get warmer get south.’ ‘Too warm, I shouldn’t wonder,’ muttered Sam Frodo. ‘But I’m beginning think it’s time got sight Fiery Mountain, saw end Road, speak. I thought first Redhorn, whatever name is, might it, till Gimli spoke piece. A fair jaw-cracker dwarf-language must be!’ Maps conveyed nothing Sam’s mind, distances strange lands seemed vast quite reckoning. All day Company remained hiding. The dark birds passed again; westering Sun grew red disappeared southwards. At dusk Company set out, turning half east steered course towards Caradhras, far away still glowed faintly red last light vanished Sun. One one white stars sprang forth sky faded. Guided Aragorn struck good path. It looked Frodo like remains ancient road, broad well planned, Hollin mountain-pass. The Moon, full, rose mountains, cast pale light shadows stones black. Many looked worked hands, though lay tumbled ruinous bleak, barren land. It cold chill hour first stir dawn, moon low. Frodo looked sky. Suddenly saw felt shadow pass high stars, moment faded flashed again. He shivered. ‘Did see anything pass over?’ whispered Gandalf, ahead. ‘No, I felt it, whatever was,’ answered. ‘It may nothing, wisp thin cloud.’ ‘It moving fast then,’ muttered Aragorn, ‘and wind.’ * * * Nothing happened night. The next morning dawned even brighter before. But air chill again; already wind turning back towards east. For two nights marched on, climbing steadily ever slowly road wound hills, mountains towered up, nearer nearer. On third morning Caradhras rose them, mighty peak, tipped snow like silver, sheer naked sides, dull red stained blood. There black look sky, sun wan. The wind gone round north-east. Gandalf snuffed air looked back. ‘Winter deepens behind us,’ said quietly Aragorn. ‘The heights away north whiter were; snow lying far shoulders. Tonight shall way high towards Redhorn Gate. We may well seen watchers narrow path, waylaid evil; weather may prove deadly enemy any. What think course now, Aragorn?’ Frodo overheard words, understood Gandalf Aragorn continuing debate begun long before. He listened anxiously. ‘I think good course beginning end, know well, Gandalf,’ answered Aragorn. ‘And perils known unknown grow go on. But must go on; good delaying passage mountains. Further south passes, till one comes Gap Rohan. I trust way since news Saruman. Who knows side marshals Horse-lords serve?’ ‘Who knows indeed!’ said Gandalf. ‘But another way, pass Caradhras: dark secret way spoken of.’ ‘But let us speak again! Not yet. Say nothing others, I beg, plain way.’ ‘We must decide go further,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Then let us weigh matter minds, others rest sleep,’ said Aragorn. In late afternoon, others finishing breakfast, Gandalf Aragorn went aside together stood looking Caradhras. Its sides dark sullen, head grey cloud. Frodo watched them, wondering way debate would go. When returned Company Gandalf spoke, knew decided face weather high pass. He relieved. He could guess dark secret way, mention seemed fill Aragorn dismay, Frodo glad abandoned. ‘From signs seen lately,’ said Gandalf, ‘I fear Redhorn Gate may watched; also I doubts weather coming behind. Snow may come. We must go speed can. Even take us two marches reach top pass. Dark come early evening. We must leave soon get ready.’ ‘I add word advice, I may,’ said Boromir. ‘I born shadow White Mountains know something journeys high places. We shall meet bitter cold, worse, come side. It help us keep secret frozen death. When leave here, still trees bushes, us carry faggot wood, large bear.’ ‘And Bill could take bit more, couldn’t you, lad?’ said Sam. The pony looked mournfully. ‘Very well,’ said Gandalf. ‘But must use wood – unless choice fire death.’ The Company set again, good speed first; soon way became steep difficult. The twisting climbing road many places almost disappeared, blocked many fallen stones. The night grew deadly dark great clouds. A bitter wind swirled among rocks. By midnight climbed knees great mountains. The narrow path wound sheer wall cliffs left, grim flanks Caradhras towered invisible gloom; right gulf darkness land fell suddenly deep ravine. Laboriously climbed sharp slope halted moment top. Frodo felt soft touch face. He put arm saw dim white flakes snow settling sleeve. They went on. But long snow falling fast, filling air, swirling Frodo’s eyes. The dark bent shapes Gandalf Aragorn pace two ahead could hardly seen. ‘I don’t like all,’ panted Sam behind. ‘Snow’s right fine morning, I like bed it’s falling. I wish lot would go Hobbiton! Folk might welcome there.’ Except high moors Northfarthing heavy fall rare Shire, regarded pleasant event chance fun. No living hobbit (save Bilbo) could remember Fell Winter 1311, white wolves invaded Shire frozen Brandywine. Gandalf halted. Snow thick hood shoulders; already ankle-deep boots. ‘This I feared,’ said. ‘What say now, Aragorn?’ ‘That I feared too,’ Aragorn answered, ‘but less things. I knew risk snow, though seldom falls heavily far south, save high mountains. But high yet; still far down, paths usually open winter.’ ‘I wonder contrivance Enemy,’ said Boromir. ‘They say land govern storms Mountains Shadow stand upon borders Mordor. He strange powers many allies.’ ‘His arm grown long indeed,’ said Gimli, ‘if draw snow North trouble us three hundred leagues away.’ ‘His arm grown long,’ said Gandalf. While halted, wind died down, snow slackened almost ceased. They tramped again. But gone furlong storm returned fresh fury. The wind whistled snow became blinding blizzard. Soon even Boromir found hard keep going. The hobbits, bent nearly double, toiled along behind taller folk, plain could go much further, snow continued. Frodo’s feet felt like lead. Pippin dragging behind. Even Gimli, stout dwarf could be, grumbling trudged. The Company halted suddenly, come agreement without words spoken. They heard eerie noises darkness round them. It may trick wind cracks gullies rocky wall, sounds shrill cries, wild howls laughter. Stones began fall mountain-side, whistling heads, crashing path beside them. Every heard dull rumble, great boulder rolled hidden heights above. ‘We cannot go tonight,’ said Boromir. ‘Let call wind will; fell voices air; stones aimed us.’ ‘I call wind,’ said Aragorn. ‘But make say untrue. There many evil unfriendly things world little love go two legs, yet league Sauron, purposes own. Some world longer he.’ ‘Caradhras called Cruel, ill name,’ said Gimli, ‘long years ago, rumour Sauron heard lands.’ ‘It matters little enemy, cannot beat attack,’ said Gandalf. ‘But do?’ cried Pippin miserably. He leaning Merry Frodo, shivering. ‘Either stop are, go back,’ said Gandalf. ‘It good going on. Only little higher, I remember rightly, path leaves cliff runs wide shallow trough bottom long hard slope. We shelter snow, stones – anything else.’ ‘And good going back storm holds,’ said Aragorn. ‘We passed place way offered shelter cliff-wall now.’ ‘Shelter!’ muttered Sam. ‘If shelter, one wall roof make house.’ The Company gathered together close cliff could. It faced southwards, near bottom leaned little, hoped would give protection northerly wind falling stones. But eddying blasts swirled round every side, snow flowed ever denser clouds. They huddled together backs wall. Bill pony stood patiently dejectedly front hobbits, screened little; long drifting snow hocks, went mounting. If larger companions hobbits would soon entirely buried. A great sleepiness came Frodo; felt sinking fast warm hazy dream. He thought fire heating toes, shadows side hearth heard Bilbo’s voice speaking. I don’t think much diary, said. Snowstorms January twelfth: need come back report that! But I wanted rest sleep, Bilbo, Frodo answered effort, felt shaken, came back painfully wakefulness. Boromir lifted ground nest snow. ‘This death halflings, Gandalf,’ said Boromir. ‘It useless sit snow goes heads. We must something save ourselves.’ ‘Give this,’ said Gandalf, searching pack drawing leathern flask. ‘Just mouthful – us. It precious. It miruvor, cordial Imladris. Elrond gave parting. Pass round!’ As soon Frodo swallowed little warm fragrant liquor felt new strength heart, heavy drowsiness left limbs. The others also revived found fresh hope vigour. But snow relent. It whirled thicker ever, wind blew louder. ‘What say fire?’ asked Boromir suddenly. ‘The choice seems near fire death, Gandalf. Doubtless shall hidden unfriendly eyes snow covered us, help us.’ ‘You may make fire, can,’ answered Gandalf. ‘If watchers endure storm, see us, fire no.’ But though brought wood kindlings advice Boromir, passed skill Elf even Dwarf strike flame would hold amid swirling wind catch wet fuel. At last reluctantly Gandalf took hand. Picking faggot held aloft moment, word command, naur edraith ammen! thrust end staff midst it. At great spout green blue flame sprang out, wood flared sputtered. ‘If see, I least revealed them,’ said. ‘I written Gandalf signs read Rivendell mouths Anduin.’ But Company cared longer watchers unfriendly eyes. Their hearts rejoiced see light fire. The wood burned merrily; though round snow hissed, pools slush crept feet, warmed hands gladly blaze. There stood, stooping circle round little dancing blowing flames. A red light tired anxious faces; behind night like black wall. But wood burning fast, snow still fell. The fire burned low, last faggot thrown on. ‘The night getting old,’ said Aragorn. ‘The dawn far off.’ ‘If dawn pierce clouds,’ said Gimli. Boromir stepped circle stared blackness. ‘The snow growing less,’ said, ‘and wind quieter.’ Frodo gazed wearily flakes still falling dark revealed white moment light dying fire; long time could see sign slackening. Then suddenly, sleep beginning creep again, aware wind indeed fallen, flakes becoming larger fewer. Very slowly dim light began grow. At last snow stopped altogether. As light grew stronger showed silent shrouded world. Below refuge white humps domes shapeless deeps beneath path trodden altogether lost; heights hidden great clouds still heavy threat snow. Gimli looked shook head. ‘Caradhras forgiven us,’ said. ‘He snow yet fling us, go on. The sooner go back better.’ To agreed, retreat difficult. It might well prove impossible. Only paces ashes fire snow lay many feet deep, higher heads hobbits; places scooped piled wind great drifts cliff. ‘If Gandalf would go us bright flame, might melt path you,’ said Legolas. The storm troubled little, alone Company remained still light heart. ‘If Elves could fly mountains, might fetch Sun save us,’ answered Gandalf. ‘But I must something work on. I cannot burn snow.’ ‘Well,’ said Boromir, ‘when heads loss bodies must serve, say country. The strongest us must seek way. See! Though snow-clad, path, came up, turned shoulder rock yonder. It snow first began burden us. If could reach point, maybe would prove easier beyond. It furlong off, I guess.’ ‘Then let us force path thither, I!’ said Aragorn. Aragorn tallest Company, Boromir, little less height, broader heavier build. He led way, Aragorn followed him. Slowly moved off, soon toiling heavily. In places snow breast-high, often Boromir seemed swimming burrowing great arms rather walking. Legolas watched smile upon lips, turned others. ‘The strongest must seek way, say you? But I say: let ploughman plough, choose otter swimming, running light grass leaf, snow – Elf.’ With sprang forth nimbly, Frodo noticed first time, though long known it, Elf boots, wore light shoes, always did, feet made little imprint snow. ‘Farewell!’ said Gandalf. ‘I go find Sun!’ Then swift runner firm sand shot away, quickly overtaking toiling men, wave hand passed them, sped distance, vanished round rocky turn. The others waited huddled together, watching Boromir Aragorn dwindled black specks whiteness. At length passed sight. The time dragged on. The clouds lowered, flakes snow came curling again. An hour, maybe, went by, though seemed far longer, last saw Legolas coming back. At time Boromir Aragorn reappeared round bend far behind came labouring slope. ‘Well,’ cried Legolas ran up, ‘I brought Sun. She walking blue fields South, little wreath snow Redhorn hillock troubles all. But I brought back gleam good hope doomed go feet. There greatest wind-drift beyond turn, Strong Men almost buried. They despaired, I returned told drift little wider wall. And side snow suddenly grows less, white coverlet cool hobbit’s toes.’ ‘Ah, I said,’ growled Gimli. ‘It ordinary storm. It ill Caradhras. He love Elves Dwarves, drift laid cut escape.’ ‘But happily Caradhras forgotten Men you,’ said Boromir, came moment. ‘And doughty Men too, I may say it; though lesser men spades might served better. Still, thrust lane drift; may grateful cannot run light Elves.’ ‘But get there, even cut drift?’ said Pippin, voicing thought hobbits. ‘Have hope!’ said Boromir. ‘I weary, I still strength left, Aragorn too. We bear little folk. The others doubt make shift tread path behind us. Come, Master Peregrin! I begin you.’ He lifted hobbit. ‘Cling back! I shall need arms,’ said strode forward. Aragorn Merry came behind. Pippin marvelled strength, seeing passage already forced tool great limbs. Even now, burdened was, widening track followed, thrusting snow aside went. They came length great drift. It flung across mountain-path like sheer sudden wall, crest, sharp shaped knives, reared twice height Boromir; middle passage beaten, rising falling like bridge. On far side Merry Pippin set down, waited Legolas rest Company arrive. After Boromir returned carrying Sam. Behind narrow well-trodden track came Gandalf, leading Bill Gimli perched among baggage. Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo. They passed lane; hardly Frodo touched ground deep rumble rolled fall stones slithering snow. The spray half blinded Company crouched cliff, air cleared saw path blocked behind them. ‘Enough,enough!’criedGimli.‘Wearedepartingasquickly may!’ And indeed last stroke malice mountainseemedtobeexpended,asifCaradhraswassatisfied invaders beaten would dare return. The threat snow lifted; clouds began break light grew broader. As Legolas reported, found snow became steadily shallow went down, even hobbits could trudge along. Soon stood flat shelf head steep slope felt first flakes snow night before. The morning far advanced. From high place looked back westwards lower lands. Far away tumble country lay foot mountain dell started climb pass. Frodo’s legs ached. He chilled bone hungry; head dizzy thought long painful march downhill. Black specks swam eyes. He rubbed them, black specks remained. In distance him, still high lower foothills, dark dots circling air. ‘The birds again!’ said Aragorn, pointing down. ‘That cannot helped now,’ said Gandalf. ‘Whether good evil, nothing us all, must go once. Not even knees Caradhras wait another night-fall!’ A cold wind flowed behind them, turned backs Redhorn Gate, stumbled wearily slope. Caradhras defeated them. Chapter 4 A JOURNEY IN THE DARK It evening, grey light waning fast, halted night. They weary. The mountains veiled deepening dusk, wind cold. Gandalf spared one mouthful miruvor Rivendell. When eaten food called council. ‘We cannot, course, go tonight,’ said. ‘The attack Redhorn Gate tired us out, must rest while.’ ‘And go?’ asked Frodo. ‘We still journey errand us,’ answered Gandalf. ‘We choice go on, return Rivendell.’ Pippin’s face brightened visibly mere mention return Rivendell; Merry Sam looked hopefully. But Aragorn Boromir made sign. Frodo looked troubled. ‘I wish I back there,’ said. ‘But I return without shame – unless indeed way, already defeated?’ ‘You right, Frodo,’ said Gandalf: ‘to go back admit defeat, face worse defeat come. If go back now, Ring must remain there: shall able set again. Then sooner later Rivendell besieged, brief bitter time destroyed. The Ringwraiths deadly enemies, shadows yet power terror would possess Ruling Ring master’s hand again.’ ‘Then must go on, way,’ said Frodo sigh. Sam sank back gloom. ‘There way may attempt,’ said Gandalf. ‘I thought beginning, first I considered journey, try it. But pleasant way, I spoken Company before. Aragorn it, pass mountains least tried.’ ‘If worse road Redhorn Gate, must evil indeed,’ said Merry. ‘But better tell us it, let us know worst once.’ ‘The road I speak leads Mines Moria,’ said Gandalf. Only Gimli lifted head; smouldering fire eyes. On others dread fell mention name. Even hobbits legend vague fear. ‘The road may lead Moria, hope lead Moria?’ said Aragorn darkly. ‘It name ill omen,’ said Boromir. ‘Nor I see need go there. If cannot cross mountains, let us journey southwards, come Gap Rohan, men friendly people, taking road I followed way hither. Or might pass cross Isen Langstrand Lebennin, come Gondor regions nigh sea.’ ‘Things changed since came north, Boromir,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Did hear I told Saruman? With I may business ere over. But Ring must come near Isengard, means prevented. The Gap Rohan closed us go Bearer. ‘As longer road: cannot afford time. We might spend year journey, pass many lands empty harbourless. Yet would safe. The watchful eyes Saruman Enemy them. When came north, Boromir, Enemy’s eyes one stray wanderer South matter small concern him: mind busy pursuit Ring. But return member Ring’s Company, peril long remain us. The danger increase every league go south naked sky. ‘Since open attempt mountain-pass plight become desperate, I fear. I see little hope, soon vanish sight while, cover trail. Therefore I advise go neither mountains, round them, them. That road rate Enemy least expect us take.’ ‘We know expects,’ said Boromir. ‘He may watch roads, likely unlikely. In case enter Moria would walk trap, hardly better knocking gates Dark Tower itself. The name Moria black.’ ‘You speak know, liken Moria stronghold Sauron,’ answered Gandalf. ‘I alone ever dungeons Dark Lord, older lesser dwelling Dol Guldur. Those pass gates Barad-duˆr return. But I would lead Moria hope coming again. If Orcs there, may prove ill us, true. But Orcs Misty Mountains scattered destroyed Battle Five Armies. The Eagles report Orcs gathering afar; hope Moria still free. ‘There even chance Dwarves there, deep hall fathers, Balin son Fundin may found. However may prove, one must tread path need chooses!’ ‘I tread path you, Gandalf!’ said Gimli. ‘I go look halls Durin, whatever may wait – find doors shut.’ ‘Good, Gimli!’ said Gandalf. ‘You encourage me. We seek hidden doors together. And come through. In ruins Dwarves, dwarf’s head less easy bewilder Elves Men Hobbits. Yet first time I Moria. I sought long Thra´in son Thro´r lost. I passed through, I came alive!’ ‘I passed Dimrill Gate,’ said Aragorn quietly; ‘but though I also came again, memory evil. I wish enter Moria second time.’ ‘And I don’t wish enter even once,’ said Pippin. ‘Nor me,’ muttered Sam. ‘Of course not!’ said Gandalf. ‘Who would? But question is: follow me, I lead there?’ ‘I will,’ said Gimli eagerly. ‘I will,’ said Aragorn heavily. ‘You followed lead almost disaster snow, said word blame. I follow lead – last warning move you. It Ring, us others I thinking now, you, Gandalf. And I say you: pass doors Moria, beware!’ ‘I go,’ said Boromir; ‘not unless vote whole Company me. What Legolas little folk say? The Ring-bearer’s voice surely heard?’ ‘I wish go Moria,’ said Legolas. The hobbits said nothing. Sam looked Frodo. At last Frodo spoke. ‘I wish go,’ said; ‘but neither I wish refuse advice Gandalf. I beg vote, slept it. Gandalf get votes easier light morning cold gloom. How wind howls!’ At words fell silent thought. They heard wind hissing among rocks trees, howling wailing round empty spaces night. Suddenly Aragorn leapt feet. ‘How wind howls!’ cried. ‘It howling wolf-voices. The Wargs come west Mountains!’ ‘Need wait morning then?’ said Gandalf. ‘It I said. The hunt up! Even live see dawn, wish journey south night wild wolves trail?’ ‘How far Moria?’ asked Boromir. ‘There door south-west Caradhras, fifteen miles crow flies, maybe twenty wolf runs,’ answered Gandalf grimly. ‘Then let us start soon light tomorrow, can,’ said Boromir. ‘The wolf one hears worse orc one fears.’ ‘True!’ said Aragorn, loosening sword sheath. ‘But warg howls, also orc prowls.’ ‘I wish I taken Elrond’s advice,’ muttered Pippin Sam. ‘I good all. There enough breed Bandobras Bullroarer me: howls freeze blood. I don’t ever remember feeling wretched.’ ‘My heart’s right toes, Mr. Pippin,’ said Sam. ‘But aren’t etten yet, stout folk us. Whatever may store old Gandalf, I’ll wager isn’t wolf’s belly.’ For defence night Company climbed top small hill sheltering. It crowned knot old twisted trees, lay broken circle boulder-stones. In midst lit fire, hope darkness silence would keep trail discovery hunting packs. Round fire sat, guard dozed uneasily. Poor Bill pony trembled sweated stood. The howling wolves round them, sometimes nearer sometimes off. In dead night many shining eyes seen peering brow hill. Some advanced almost ring stones. At gap circle great dark wolf-shape could seen halted, gazing them. A shuddering howl broke him, captain summoning pack assault. Gandalf stood strode forward, holding staff aloft. ‘Listen, Hound Sauron!’ cried. ‘Gandalf here. Fly, value foul skin! I shrivel tail snout, come within ring.’ The wolf snarled sprang towards great leap. At moment sharp twang. Legolas loosed bow. There hideous yell, leaping shape thudded ground; Elvish arrow pierced throat. The watching eyes suddenly extinguished. Gandalf Aragorn strode forward, hill deserted; hunting packs fled. All darkness grew silent, cry came sighing wind. The night old, westward waning moon setting, gleaming fitfully breaking clouds. Suddenly Frodo started sleep. Without warning storm howls broke fierce wild camp. A great host Wargs gathered silently attacking every side once. ‘Fling fuel fire!’ cried Gandalf hobbits. ‘Draw blades, stand back back!’ In leaping light, fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw many grey shapes spring ring stones. More followed. Through throat one huge leader Aragorn passed sword thrust; great sweep Boromir hewed head another. Beside Gimli stood stout legs apart, wielding dwarf-axe. The bow Legolas singing. In wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly grow: rose up, great menacing shape like monument ancient king stone set upon hill. Stooping like cloud, lifted burning branch strode meet wolves. They gave back him. High air tossed blazing brand. It flared sudden white radiance like lightning; voice rolled like thunder. ‘Naur edraith ammen! Naur dan ngaurhoth!’ cried. There roar crackle, tree burst leaf bloom blinding flame. The fire leapt tree-top tree-top. The whole hill crowned dazzling light. The swords knives defenders shone flickered. The last arrow Legolas kindled air flew, plunged burning heart great wolf-chieftain. All others fled. Slowly fire died till nothing left falling ash sparks; bitter smoke curled burned tree-stumps, blew darkly hill, first light dawn came dimly sky. Their enemies routed return. ‘What I tell you, Mr. Pippin?’ said Sam, sheathing sword. ‘Wolves won’t get him. That eye-opener, mistake! Nearly singed hair head!’ When full light morning came signs wolves found, looked vain bodies dead. No trace fight remained charred trees arrows Legolas lying hill-top. All undamaged save one point left. ‘It I feared,’ said Gandalf. ‘These ordinary wolves hunting food wilderness. Let us eat quickly go!’ That day weather changed again, almost command power longer use snow, since retreated pass, power wished clear light things moved wild could seen far away. The wind turning north north-west night, failed. The clouds vanished southwards sky opened, high blue. As stood upon hillside, ready depart, pale sunlight gleamed mountain-tops. ‘We must reach doors sunset,’ said Gandalf, ‘or I fear shall reach all. It far, path may winding, Aragorn cannot guide us; seldom walked country, I west wall Moria, long ago. ‘There lies,’ said, pointing away south-eastwards mountains’ sides fell sheer shadows feet. In distance could dimly seen line bare cliffs, midst, taller rest, one great grey wall. ‘When left pass I led southwards, back starting point, may noticed. It well I so, several miles less cross, haste needed. Let us go!’ ‘I know hope,’ said Boromir grimly: ‘that Gandalf find seeks, coming cliff shall find gates lost ever. All choices seem ill, caught wolves wall likeliest chance. Lead on!’ Gimli walked ahead wizard’s side, eager come Moria. Together led Company back towards mountains. The road old Moria west lain along course stream, Sirannon, ran feet cliffs near doors stood. But either Gandalf astray, else land changed recent years; strike stream looked find it, miles southwards start. The morning passing towards noon, still Company wandered scrambled barren country red stones. Nowhere could see gleam water hear sound it. All bleak dry. Their hearts sank. They saw living thing, bird sky; night would bring, caught lost land, none cared think. Suddenly Gimli, pressed ahead, called back them. He standing knoll pointing right. Hurrying saw deep narrow channel. It empty silent, hardly trickle water flowed among brown red-stained stones bed; near side path, much broken decayed, wound way among ruined walls paving-stones ancient highroad. ‘Ah! Here last!’ said Gandalf. ‘This stream ran: Sirannon, Gate-stream, used call it. But happened water, I cannot guess; used swift noisy. Come! We must hurry on. We late.’ The Company footsore tired; trudged doggedly along rough winding track many miles. The sun turned noon began go west. After brief halt hasty meal went again. Before mountains frowned, path lay deep trough land could see higher shoulders far eastward peaks. At length came sharp bend. There road, veering southwards brink channel steep fall land left, turned went due east again. Rounding corner saw low cliff, five fathoms high, broken jagged top. Over trickling water dripped, wide cleft seemed carved fall strong full. ‘Indeed things changed!’ said Gandalf. ‘But mistaking place. There remains Stair Falls. If I remember right, flight steps cut rock side, main road wound away left climbed several loops level ground top. There used shallow valley beyond falls right Walls Moria, Sirannon flowed road beside it. Let us go see things like now!’ They found stone steps without difficulty, Gimli sprang swiftly them, followed Gandalf Frodo. When reached top saw could go way, reason drying Gate-stream revealed. Behind sinking Sun filled cool western sky glimmering gold. Before stretched dark still lake. Neither sky sunset reflected sullen surface. The Sirannon dammed filled valley. Beyond ominous water reared vast cliffs, stern faces pallid fading light: final impassable. No sign gate entrance, fissure crack could Frodo see frowning stone. ‘There Walls Moria,’ said Gandalf, pointing across water. ‘And Gate stood upon time, Elven Door end road Hollin come. But way blocked. None Company, I guess, wish swim gloomy water end day. It unwholesome look.’ ‘We must find way round northern edge,’ said Gimli. ‘The first thing Company climb main path see lead us. Even lake, could get baggage-pony stair.’ ‘But case cannot take poor beast Mines,’ said Gandalf. ‘The road mountains dark road, places narrow steep cannot tread, even can.’ ‘Poor old Bill!’ said Frodo. ‘I thought that. And poor Sam! I wonder say?’ ‘I sorry,’ said Gandalf. ‘Poor Bill useful companion, goes heart turn adrift now. I would travelled lighter brought animal, least one Sam fond of, I way. I feared along obliged take road.’ The day drawing end, cold stars glinting sky high sunset, Company, speed could, climbed slopes reached side lake. In breadth looked two three furlongs widest point. How far stretched away southward could see failing light; northern end half mile stood, stony ridges enclosed valley water’s edge rim open ground. They hurried forward, still mile two go could reach point far shore Gandalf making for; still find doors. When came northernmost corner lake found narrow creek barred way. It green stagnant, thrust like slimy arm towards enclosing hills. Gimli strode forward undeterred, found water shallow, ankle-deep edge. Behind walked file, threading way care, weedy pools sliding greasy stones, footing treacherous. Frodo shuddered disgust touch dark unclean water feet. As Sam, last Company, led Bill dry ground far side, came soft sound: swish, followed plop, fish disturbed still surface water. Turning quickly saw ripples, black-edged shadow waning light: great rings widening outwards point far lake. There bubbling noise, silence. The dusk deepened, last gleams sunset veiled cloud. Gandalf pressed great pace, others followed quickly could. They reached strip dry land lake cliffs: narrow, often hardly dozen yards across, encumbered fallen rock stones; found way, hugging cliff, keeping far dark water might. A mile southwards along shore came upon holly trees. Stumps dead boughs rotting shallows, remains seemed old thickets, hedge lined road across drowned valley. But close cliff stood, still strong living, two tall trees, larger trees holly Frodo ever seen imagined. Their great roots spread wall water. Under looming cliffs looked like mere bushes, seen far top Stair; towered overhead, stiff, dark, silent, throwing deep night-shadows feet, standing like sentinel pillars end road. ‘Well, last!’ said Gandalf. ‘Here Elvenway Hollin ended. Holly token people land, planted mark end domain; West-door made chiefly use traffic Lords Moria. Those happier days, still close friendship times folk different race, even Dwarves Elves.’ ‘It fault Dwarves friendship waned,’ said Gimli. ‘I heard fault Elves,’ said Legolas. ‘I heard both,’ said Gandalf; ‘and I give judgement now. But I beg two, Legolas Gimli, least friends, help me. I need both. The doors shut hidden, sooner find better. Night hand!’ Turning others said: ‘While I searching, make ready enter Mines? For I fear must say farewell good beast burden. You must lay aside much stuff brought bitter weather: need inside, nor, I hope, come journey South. Instead us must take share pony carried, especially food water-skins.’ ‘But can’t leave poor old Bill behind forsaken place, Mr. Gandalf!’ cried Sam, angry distressed. ‘I won’t it, that’s flat. After come far all!’ ‘I sorry, Sam,’ said wizard. ‘But Door opens I think able drag Bill inside, long dark Moria. You choose Bill master.’ ‘He’d follow Mr. Frodo dragon’s den, I led him,’ protested Sam. ‘It’d nothing short murder turn loose wolves about.’ ‘It short murder, I hope,’ said Gandalf. He laid hand pony’s head, spoke low voice. ‘Go words guard guiding you,’ said. ‘You wise beast, learned much Rivendell. Make ways places find grass, come time Elrond’s house, wherever wish go. ‘There, Sam! He quite much chance escaping wolves getting home have.’ Sam stood sullenly pony returned answer. Bill, seeming understand well going on, nuzzled him, putting nose Sam’s ear. Sam burst tears, fumbled straps, unlading pony’s packs throwing ground. The others sorted goods, making pile could left behind, dividing rest. When done turned watch Gandalf. He appeared done nothing. He standing two trees gazing blank wall cliff, would bore hole eyes. Gimli wandering about, tapping stone axe. Legolas pressed rock, listening. ‘Well, ready,’ said Merry; ‘but Doors? I can’t see sign them.’ ‘Dwarf-doors made seen shut,’ said Gimli. ‘They invisible, makers cannot find open them, secret forgotten.’ ‘But Door made secret known Dwarves,’ said Gandalf, coming suddenly life turning round. ‘Unless things altogether changed, eyes know look may discover signs.’ He walked forward wall. Right shadow trees smooth space, passed hands fro, muttering words breath. Then stepped back. ‘Look!’ said. ‘Can see anything now?’ The Moon shone upon grey face rock; could see nothing else while. Then slowly surface, wizard’s hands passed, faint lines appeared, like slender veins silver running stone. At first pale gossamer-threads, fine twinkled fitfully Moon caught them, steadily grew broader clearer, design could guessed. At top, high Gandalf could reach, arch interlacing letters Elvish character. Below, though threads places blurred broken, outline could seen anvil hammer surmounted crown seven stars. Beneath two trees, bearing crescent moons. More clearly else shone forth middle door single star many rays. ‘There emblems Durin!’ cried Gimli. ‘And Tree High Elves!’ said Legolas. ‘And Star House Fe¨anor,’ said Gandalf. ‘They wrought ithildin mirrors starlight moonlight, sleeps touched one speaks words long forgotten Middle-earth. It long since I heard them, I thought deeply I could recall mind.’ ‘What writing say?’ asked Frodo, trying decipher inscription arch. ‘I thought I knew elf-letters, I cannot read these.’ ‘The words elven-tongue West Middleearth Elder Days,’ answered Gandalf. ‘But say anything importance us. They say only: The Doors Durin, Lord Moria. Speak, friend, enter. And underneath small faint written: I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor Hollin drew signs.’ ‘What mean speak, friend, enter?’ asked Merry. ‘That plain enough,’ said Gimli. ‘If friend, speak password, doors open, enter.’ ‘Yes,’ said Gandalf, ‘these doors probably governed words. Some dwarf-gates open special times, particular persons; locks keys still needed necessary times words known. These doors key. In days Durin secret. They usually stood open doorwards sat here. But shut, knew opening word could speak pass in. At least recorded, not, Gimli?’ ‘It is,’ said dwarf. ‘But word remembered. Narvi craft kindred vanished earth.’ ‘But know word, Gandalf?’ asked Boromir surprise. ‘No!’ said wizard. The others looked dismayed; Aragorn, knew Gandalf well, remained silent unmoved. ‘Then use bringing us accursed spot?’ cried Boromir, glancing back shudder dark water. ‘You told us passed Mines. How could be, know enter?’ ‘The answer first question, Boromir,’ said wizard, ‘is I know word – yet. But shall soon see. And,’ added, glint eyes bristling brows, ‘you may ask use deeds proved useless. As question: doubt tale? Or wits left? I enter way. I came East. ‘If wish know, I tell doors open outwards. From inside may thrust open hands. From outside nothing move save spell command. They cannot forced inwards.’ ‘What going then?’ asked Pippin, undaunted wizard’s bristling brows. ‘Knock doors head, Peregrin Took,’ said Gandalf. ‘But shatter them, I allowed little peace foolish questions, I seek opening words. ‘I knew every spell tongues Elves Men Orcs, ever used purpose. I still remember ten score without searching mind. But trials, I think, needed; I shall call Gimli words secret dwarf-tongue teach none. The opening words Elvish, like writing arch: seems certain.’ He stepped rock again, lightly touched staff silver star middle beneath sign anvil. Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen! Fennas nogothrim, lasto beth lammen! said commanding voice. The silver lines faded, blank grey stone stir. Many times repeated words different order, varied them. Then tried spells, one another, speaking faster louder, soft slow. Then spoke many single words Elvish speech. Nothing happened. The cliff towered night, countless stars kindled, wind blew cold, doors stood fast. Again Gandalf approached wall, lifting arms spoke tones command rising wrath. Edro, edro! cried, struck rock staff. Open, open! shouted, followed command every language ever spoken West Middleearth. Then threw staff ground, sat silence. At moment far wind bore listening ears howling wolves. Bill pony started fear, Sam sprang side whispered softly him. ‘Do let run away!’ said Boromir. ‘It seems shall need still, wolves find us. How I hate foul pool!’ He stooped picking large stone cast far dark water. The stone vanished soft slap; instant swish bubble. Great rippling rings formed surface beyond stone fallen, moved slowly towards foot cliff. ‘Why that, Boromir?’ said Frodo. ‘I hate place, too, I afraid. I don’t know what: wolves, dark behind doors, something else. I afraid pool. Don’t disturb it!’ ‘I wish could get away!’ said Merry. ‘Why doesn’t Gandalf something quick?’ said Pippin. Gandalf took notice them. He sat head bowed, either despair anxious thought. The mournful howling wolves heard again. The ripples water grew came closer; already lapping shore. With suddenness startled wizard sprang feet. He laughing! ‘I it!’ cried. ‘Of course, course! Absurdly simple, like riddles see answer.’ Picking staff stood rock said clear voice: Mellon! The star shone briefly faded again. Then silently great doorway outlined, though crack joint visible before. Slowly divided middle swung outwards inch inch, doors lay back wall. Through opening shadowy stair could seen climbing steeply up; beyond lower steps darkness deeper night. The Company stared wonder. ‘I wrong all,’ said Gandalf, ‘and Gimli too. Merry, people, right track. The opening word inscribed archway time! The translation been: Say ‘‘Friend’’ enter. I speak Elvish word friend doors opened. Quite simple. Too simple learned lore-master suspicious days. Those happier times. Now let us go!’ He strode forward set foot lowest step. But moment several things happened. Frodo felt something seize ankle, fell cry. Bill pony gave wild neigh fear, turned tail dashed away along lakeside darkness. Sam leaped him, hearing Frodo’s cry ran back again, weeping cursing. The others swung round saw waters lake seething, host snakes swimming southern end. Out water long sinuous tentacle crawled; pale-green luminous wet. Its fingered end hold Frodo’s foot, dragging water. Sam knees slashing knife. The arm let go Frodo, Sam pulled away, crying help. Twenty arms came rippling out. The dark water boiled, hideous stench. ‘Into gateway! Up stairs! Quick!’ shouted Gandalf leaping back. Rousing horror seemed rooted Sam ground stood, drove forward. They time. Sam Frodo steps up, Gandalf begun climb, groping tentacles writhed across narrow shore fingered cliff-wall doors. One came wriggling threshold, glistening starlight. Gandalf turned paused. If considering word would close gate within, need. Many coiling arms seized doors either side, horrible strength, swung round. With shattering echo slammed, light lost. A noise rending crashing came dully ponderous stone. Sam,clingingtoFrodo’sarm,collapsedonastepintheblack darkness. ‘Poor old Bill!’ said choking voice. ‘Poor old Bill!Wolvesandsnakes!Butthesnakesweretoomuchforhim. I choose, Mr. Frodo. I come you.’ They heard Gandalf go back steps thrust staff doors. There quiver stone stairs trembled, doors open. * * * ‘Well, well!’ said wizard. ‘The passage blocked behind us now, one way – side mountains. I fear sounds boulders piled up, trees uprooted thrown across gate. I sorry; trees beautiful, stood long.’ ‘I felt something horrible near moment foot first touched water,’ said Frodo. ‘What thing, many them?’ ‘I know,’ answered Gandalf; ‘but arms guided one purpose. Something crept, driven dark waters mountains. There older fouler things Orcs deep places world.’ He speak aloud thought whatever dwelt lake, seized Frodo first among Company. Boromir muttered breath, echoing stone magnified sound hoarse whisper could hear: ‘In deep places world! And thither going wish. Who lead us deadly dark?’ ‘I will,’ said Gandalf, ‘and Gimli shall walk me. Follow staff!’ As wizard passed ahead great steps, held staff aloft, tip came faint radiance. The wide stairway sound undamaged. Two hundred steps counted, broad shallow; top found arched passage level floor leading dark. ‘Let us sit rest something eat, landing, since can’t find dining-room!’ said Frodo. He begun shake terror clutching arm, suddenly felt extremely hungry. The proposal welcomed all; sat upper steps, dim figures gloom. After eaten, Gandalf gave third sip miruvor Rivendell. ‘It last much longer, I afraid,’ said; ‘but I think need horror gate. And unless great luck, shall need left see side! Go carefully water, too! There many streams wells Mines, touched. We may chance filling skins bottles till come Dimrill Dale.’ ‘How long going take us?’ asked Frodo. ‘I cannot say,’ answered Gandalf. ‘It depends many chances. But going straight, without mishap losing way, shall take three four marches, I expect. It cannot less forty miles West-door East-gate direct line, road may wind much.’ After brief rest started way again. All eager get journey quickly possible, willing, tired were, go marching still several hours. Gandalf walked front before. In left hand held glimmering staff, light showed ground feet; right held sword Glamdring. Behind came Gimli, eyes glinting dim light turned head side side. Behind dwarf walked Frodo, drawn short sword, Sting. No gleam came blades Sting Glamdring; comfort, work Elvish smiths Elder Days swords shone cold light, Orcs near hand. Behind Frodo went Sam, Legolas, young hobbits, Boromir. In dark rear, grim silent, walked Aragorn. The passage twisted round turns, began descend. It went steadily long became level again. The air grew hot stifling, foul, times felt currents cooler air upon faces, issuing half-guessed openings walls. There many these. In pale ray wizard’s staff, Frodo caught glimpses stairs arches, passages tunnels, sloping up, running steeply down, opening blankly dark either side. It bewildering beyond hope remembering. Gimli aided Gandalf little, except stout courage. At least not, others, troubled mere darkness itself. Often wizard consulted points choice way doubtful; always Gandalf final word. The Mines Moria vast intricate beyond imagination Gimli, Glo´in’s son, dwarf mountain-race though was. To Gandalf far-off memories journey long little help, even gloom despite windings road knew whither wished go, falter, long path led towards goal. ‘Do afraid!’ said Aragorn. There pause longer usual, Gandalf Gimli whispering together; others crowded behind, waiting anxiously. ‘Do afraid! I many journey, never one dark; tales Rivendell greater deeds I seen. He go astray – path find. He led us fears, lead us again, whatever cost himself. He surer finding way home blind night cats Queen Beru´thiel.’ It well Company guide. They fuel means making torches; desperate scramble doors many things left behind. But without light would soon come grief. There many roads choose from, also many places holes pitfalls, dark wells beside path passing feet echoed. There fissures chasms walls floor, every crack would open right feet. The widest seven feet across, long Pippin could summon enough courage leap dreadful gap. The noise churning water came far below, great mill-wheel turning depths. ‘Rope!’ muttered Sam. ‘I knew I’d want it, I hadn’t got it!’ As dangers became frequent march became slower. Already seemed tramping on, on, endlessly mountains’ roots. They weary, yet seemed comfort thought halting anywhere. Frodo’s spirits risen escape, food draught cordial; deep uneasiness, growing dread, crept again. Though healed Rivendell knifestroke, grim wound without effect. His senses sharper aware things could seen. One sign change soon noticed could see dark companions, save perhaps Gandalf. And case bearer Ring: hung upon chain breast, whiles seemed heavy weight. He felt certainty evil ahead evil following; said nothing. He gripped tighter hilt sword went doggedly. The Company behind spoke seldom, hurried whispers. There sound sound feet: dull stump Gimli’s dwarf-boots; heavy tread Boromir; light step Legolas; soft, scarceheard patter hobbit-feet; rear slow firm footfalls Aragorn long stride. When halted moment heard nothing all, unless occasionally faint trickle drip unseen water. Yet Frodo began hear, imagine heard, something else: like faint fall soft bare feet. It never loud enough, near enough, feel certain heard it; started never stopped, Company moving. But echo, halted pattered little itself, grew still. * * * It nightfall entered Mines. They going several hours brief halts, Gandalf came first serious check. Before stood wide dark arch opening three passages: led general direction, eastwards; left-hand passage plunged down, right-hand climbed up, middle way seemed run on, smooth level narrow. ‘I memory place all!’ said Gandalf, standing uncertainly arch. He held staff hope finding marks inscription might help choice; nothing kind seen. ‘I weary decide,’ said, shaking head. ‘And I expect weary I am, wearier. We better halt left night. You know I mean! In ever dark; outside late Moon riding westward middle-night passed.’ ‘Poor old Bill!’ said Sam. ‘I wonder is. I hope wolves haven’t got yet.’ To left great arch found stone door: half closed, swung back easily gentle thrust. Beyond seemed lie wide chamber cut rock. ‘Steady! Steady!’ cried Gandalf, Merry Pippin pushed forward, glad find place could rest least feeling shelter open passage. ‘Steady! You know inside yet. I go first.’ He went cautiously, others filed behind. ‘There!’ said, pointing staff middle floor. Before feet saw large round hole like mouth well. Broken rusty chains lay edge trailed black pit. Fragments stone lay near. ‘One might fallen still wondering going strike bottom,’ said Aragorn Merry. ‘Let guide go first one.’ ‘This seems guardroom, made watching three passages,’ said Gimli. ‘That hole plainly well guards’ use, covered stone lid. But lid broken, must take care dark.’ Pippin felt curiously attracted well. While others unrolling blankets making beds walls chamber, far possible hole floor, crept edge peered over. A chill air seemed strike face, rising invisible depths. Moved sudden impulse groped loose stone, let drop. He felt heart beat many times sound. Then far below, stone fallen deep water cavernous place, came plunk, distant, magnified repeated hollow shaft. ‘What’s that?’ cried Gandalf. He relieved Pippin confessed done; angry, Pippin could see eye glinting. ‘Fool Took!’ growled. ‘This serious journey, hobbit walking-party. Throw next time, nuisance. Now quiet!’ Nothing heard several minutes; came depths faint knocks: tom-tap, tap-tom. They stopped, echoes died away, repeated: tap-tom, tom-tap, tap-tap, tom. They sounded disquietingly like signals sort; knocking died away heard again. ‘That sound hammer, I never heard one,’ said Gimli. ‘Yes,’ said Gandalf, ‘and I like it. It may nothing Peregrin’s foolish stone; probably something disturbed would better left quiet. Pray, nothing kind again! Let us hope shall get rest without trouble. You, Pippin, go first watch, reward,’ growled, rolled blanket. Pippin sat miserably door pitch dark; kept turning round, fearing unknown thing would crawl well. He wished could cover hole, blanket, dared move go near it, even though Gandalf seemed asleep. Actually Gandalf awake, though lying still silent. He deep thought, trying recall every memory former journey Mines, considering anxiously next course take; false turn might disastrous. After hour rose came Pippin. ‘Get corner sleep, lad,’ said kindly tone. ‘You want sleep, I expect. I cannot get wink, I may well watching.’ ‘I know matter me,’ muttered, sat door. ‘I need smoke! I tasted since morning snowstorm.’ The last thing Pippin saw, sleep took him, dark glimpse old wizard huddled floor, shielding glowing chip gnarled hands knees. The flicker moment showed sharp nose, puff smoke. It Gandalf roused sleep. He sat watched alone six hours, let others rest. ‘And watches I made mind,’ said. ‘I like feel middle way; I like smell left-hand way: foul air there, I guide. I shall take right-hand passage. It time began climb again.’ For eight dark hours, counting two brief halts, marched on; met danger, heard nothing, saw nothing faint gleam wizard’s light, bobbing like will-o’-the-wisp front them. The passage chosen wound steadily upwards. As far could judge went great mounting curves, rose grew loftier wider. There openings galleries tunnels either side, floor level sound, without pits cracks. Evidently struck important road; went forward quicker done first march. In way advanced fifteen miles, measured direct line east, though must actually walked twenty miles more. As road climbed upwards, Frodo’s spirits rose little; still felt oppressed, still times heard, thought heard, away behind Company beyond fall patter feet, following footstep echo. They marched far hobbits could endure without rest, thinking place could sleep, suddenly walls right left vanished. They seemed passed arched doorway black empty space. There great draught warmer air behind them, darkness cold faces. They halted crowded anxiously together. Gandalf seemed pleased. ‘I chose right way,’ said. ‘At last coming habitable parts, I guess far eastern side. But high up, good deal higher Dimrill Gate, unless I mistaken. From feeling air must wide hall. I risk little real light.’ He raised staff, brief instant blaze like flash lightning. Great shadows sprang fled, second saw vast roof far heads upheld many mighty pillars hewn stone. Before either side stretched huge empty hall; black walls, polished smooth glass, flashed glittered. Three entrances saw, dark black arches: one straight eastwards, one either side. Then light went out. ‘That I shall venture present,’ said Gandalf. ‘There used great windows mountainside, shafts leading light upper reaches Mines. I think reached now, night outside again, cannot tell morning. If I right, tomorrow may actually see morning peeping in. But meanwhile better go further. Let us rest, can. Things gone well far, greater part dark road over. But yet, long way Gates open world.’ The Company spent night great cavernous hall, huddled close together corner escape draught: seemed steady inflow chill air eastern archway. All lay hung darkness, hollow immense, oppressed loneliness vastness dolven halls endlessly branching stairs passages. The wildest imaginings dark rumour ever suggested hobbits fell altogether short actual dread wonder Moria. ‘There must mighty crowd dwarves one time,’ said Sam; ‘and every one busier badgers five hundred years make this, hard rock too! What for? They didn’t live darksome holes surely?’ ‘These holes,’ said Gimli. ‘This great realm city Dwarrowdelf. And old darksome, full light splendour, still remembered songs.’ He rose standing dark began chant deep voice, echoes ran away roof. The world young, mountains green, No stain yet Moon seen, No words laid stream stone When Durin woke walked alone. He named nameless hills dells; He drank yet untasted wells; He stooped looked Mirrormere, And saw crown stars appear, As gems upon silver thread, Above shadow head. The world fair, mountains tall, In Elder Days fall Of mighty kings Nargothrond And Gondolin, beyond The Western Seas passed away: The world fair Durin’s Day. A king carven throne In many-pillared halls stone With golden roof silver floor, And runes power upon door. The light sun star moon In shining lamps crystal hewn Undimmed cloud shade night There shone ever fair bright. There hammer anvil smote, There chisel clove, graver wrote; There forged blade, bound hilt; The delver mined, mason built. There beryl, pearl, opal pale, And metal wrought like fishes’ mail, Buckler corslet, axe sword, And shining spears laid hoard. Unwearied Durin’s folk; Beneath mountains music woke: The harpers harped, minstrels sang, And gates trumpets rang. The world grey, mountains old, The forge’s fire ashen-cold; No harp wrung, hammer falls: The darkness dwells Durin’s halls; The shadow lies upon tomb In Moria, Khazad-duˆm. But still sunken stars appear In dark windless Mirrormere; There lies crown water deep, Till Durin wakes sleep. ‘I like that!’ said Sam. ‘I like learn it. In Moria, Khazad-duˆm! But makes darkness seem heavier, thinking lamps. Are piles jewels gold lying still?’ Gimli silent. Having sung song would say more. ‘Piles jewels?’ said Gandalf. ‘No. The Orcs often plundered Moria; nothing left upper halls. And since dwarves fled, one dares seek shafts treasuries deep places: drowned water – shadow fear.’ ‘Then dwarves want come back for?’ asked Sam. ‘For mithril,’ answered Gandalf. ‘The wealth Moria gold jewels, toys Dwarves; iron, servant. Such things found here, true, especially iron; need delve them: things desired could obtain traffic. For alone world found Moria-silver, true-silver called it: mithril Elvish name. The Dwarves name tell. Its worth ten times gold, beyond price; little left ground, even Orcs dare delve it. The lodes lead away north towards Caradhras, darkness. The Dwarves tell tale; even mithril foundation wealth, also destruction: delved greedily deep, disturbed fled, Durin’s Bane. Of brought light Orcs gathered nearly all, given tribute Sauron, covets it. ‘Mithril! All folk desired it. It could beaten like copper, polished like glass; Dwarves could make metal, light yet harder tempered steel. Its beauty like common silver, beauty mithril tarnish grow dim. The Elves dearly loved it, among many uses made ithildin, starmoon, saw upon doors. Bilbo corslet mithril-rings Thorin gave him. I wonder become it? Gathering dust still Michel Delving Mathom-house, I suppose.’ ‘What?’ cried Gimli, startled silence. ‘A corslet Moria-silver? That kingly gift!’ ‘Yes,’ said Gandalf. ‘I never told him, worth greater value whole Shire everything it.’ Frodo said nothing, put hand tunic touched rings mail-shirt. He felt staggered think walking price Shire jacket. Had Bilbo known? He felt doubt Bilbo knew quite well. It indeed kingly gift. But thoughts carried away dark Mines, Rivendell, Bilbo, Bag End days Bilbo still there. He wished heart back there, days, mowing lawn, pottering among flowers, never heard Moria, mithril – Ring. A deep silence fell. One one others fell asleep. Frodo guard. As breath came unseen doors deep places, dread came him. His hands cold brow damp. He listened. All mind given listening nothing else two slow hours; heard sound, even imagined echo footfall. His watch nearly over, when, far guessed western archway stood, fancied could see two pale points light, almost like luminous eyes. He started. His head nodded. ‘I must nearly fallen asleep guard,’ thought. ‘I edge dream.’ He stood rubbed eyes, remained standing, peering dark, relieved Legolas. When lay quickly went sleep, seemed dream went on: heard whispers, saw two pale points light approaching, slowly. He woke found others speaking softly near him, dim light falling face. High eastern archway shaft near roof came long pale gleam; across hall northern arch light also glimmered faint distantly. Frodo sat up. ‘Good morning!’ said Gandalf. ‘For morning last. I right, see. We high east side Moria. Before today ought find Great Gates see waters Mirrormere lying Dimrill Dale us.’ ‘I shall glad,’ said Gimli. ‘I looked Moria, great, become dark dreadful; found sign kindred. I doubt Balin ever came here.’ After breakfasted Gandalf decided go once. ‘We tired, shall rest better outside,’ said. ‘I think none us wish spend another night Moria.’ ‘No indeed!’ said Boromir. ‘Which way shall take? Yonder eastward arch?’ ‘Maybe,’ said Gandalf. ‘But I know yet exactly are. Unless I quite astray, I guess north Great Gates; may easy find right road them. The eastern arch probably prove way must take; make minds ought look us. Let us go towards light north door. If could find window would help, I fear light comes deep shafts.’ Following lead Company passed northern arch. They found wide corridor. As went along glimmer grew stronger, saw came doorway right. It high flat-topped, stone door still upon hinges, standing half open. Beyond large square chamber. It dimly lit, eyes, long time dark, seemed dazzlingly bright, blinked entered. Their feet disturbed deep dust upon floor, stumbled among things lying doorway whose shapes could first make out. The chamber lit wide shaft high eastern wall; slanted upwards and, far above, small square patch blue sky could seen. The light shaft fell directly table middle room: single oblong block, two feet high, upon laid great slab white stone. ‘It looks like tomb,’ muttered Frodo, bent forwards curious sense foreboding, look closely it. Gandalf came quickly side. On slab runes deeply graven: ‘These Daeron’s Runes, used old Moria,’ said Gandalf. ‘Here written tongues Men Dwarves: balin son fundin lord moria.’ ‘He dead then,’ said Frodo. ‘I feared so.’ Gimli cast hood face. Chapter 5 THE BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-DUˆ M The Company Ring stood silent beside tomb Balin. Frodo thought Bilbo long friendship dwarf, Balin’s visit Shire long ago. In dusty chamber mountains seemed thousand years ago side world. At length stirred looked up, began search anything would give tidings Balin’s fate, show become folk. There another smaller door side chamber, shaft. By doors could see many bones lying, among broken swords axe-heads, cloven shields helms. Some swords crooked: orc-scimitars blackened blades. There many recesses cut rock walls, large iron-bound chests wood. All broken plundered; beside shattered lid one lay remains book. It slashed stabbed partly burned, stained black dark marks like old blood little could read. Gandalf lifted carefully, leaves cracked broke laid slab. He pored time without speaking. Frodo Gimli standing side could see, gingerly turned leaves, written many different hands, runes, Moria Dale, Elvish script. At last Gandalf looked up. ‘It seems record fortunes Balin’s folk,’ said. ‘I guess began coming Dimrill Dale nigh thirty years ago: pages seem numbers referring years arrival. The top page marked one – three, least two missing beginning. Listen this! ‘We drove orcs great gate guard – I think; next word blurred burned: probably room – slew many bright – I think – sun dale. Flo´i killed arrow. He slew great. Then blur followed Flo´i grass near Mirror mere. The next line two I cannot read. Then comes We taken twentyfirst hall North end dwell in. There I cannot read what. A shaft mentioned. Then Balin set seat Chamber Mazarbul.’ ‘The Chamber Records,’ said Gimli. ‘I guess stand.’ ‘Well, I read long way,’ said Gandalf, ‘except word gold, Durin’s Axe something helm. Then Balin lord Moria. That seems end chapter. After stars another hand begins, I see found truesilver, later word wellforged, something, I it! mithril; last two lines O´ seek upper armouries Third Deep, something go westwards, blur, Hollin gate.’ Gandalf paused set leaves aside. ‘There several pages sort, rather hastily written much damaged,’ said; ‘but I make little light. Now must number leaves missing, begin numbered five, fifth year colony, I suppose. Let see! No, cut stained; I cannot read them. We might better sunlight. Wait! Here something: large bold hand using Elvish script.’ ‘That would Ori’s hand,’ said Gimli, looking wizard’s arm. ‘He could write well speedily, often used Elvish characters.’ ‘I fear ill tidings record fair hand,’ said Gandalf. ‘The first clear word sorrow, rest line lost, unless ends estre. Yes, must yestre followed day tenth novembre Balin lord Moria fell Dimrill Dale. He went alone look Mirror mere. orc shot behind stone. slew orc, many . . . east Silverlode. The remainder page blurred I hardly make anything out, I think I read barred gates, hold long if, perhaps horrible suffer. Poor Balin! He seems kept title took less five years. I wonder happened afterwards; time puzzle last pages. Here last page all.’ He paused sighed. ‘It grim reading,’ said. ‘I fear end cruel. Listen! We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They taken Bridge second hall. Fra´r Lo´ni Na´li fell there. Then four lines smeared I read went 5 days ago. The last lines run pool wall Westgate. The Watcher Water took O´ in. We cannot get out. The end comes, drums, drums deep. I wonder means. The last thing written trailing scrawl elf-letters: coming. There nothing more.’ Gandalf paused stood silent thought. A sudden dread horror chamber fell Company. ‘We cannot get out,’ muttered Gimli. ‘It well us pool sunk little, Watcher sleeping southern end.’ Gandalf raised head looked round. ‘They seem made last stand doors,’ said; ‘but many left time. So ended attempt retake Moria! It valiant foolish. The time come yet. Now, I fear, must say farewell Balin son Fundin. Here must lie halls fathers. We take book, Book Mazarbul, look closely later. You better keep it, Gimli, take back Da´in, get chance. It interest him, though grieve deeply. Come, let us go! The morning passing.’ ‘Which way shall go?’ asked Boromir. ‘Back hall,’ answered Gandalf. ‘But visit room vain. I know are. This must be, Gimli says, Chamber Mazarbul; hall must twenty-first North-end. Therefore leave eastern arch hall, bear right south, go downwards. The Twenty-first Hall Seventh Level, six level Gates. Come now! Back hall!’ Gandalf hardly spoken words, came great noise: rolling Boom seemed come depths far below, tremble stone feet. They sprang towards door alarm. Doom, doom rolled again, huge hands turning caverns Moria vast drum. Then came echoing blast: great horn blown hall, answering horns harsh cries heard off. There hurrying sound many feet. ‘They coming!’ cried Legolas. ‘We cannot get out,’ said Gimli. ‘Trapped!’ cried Gandalf. ‘Why I delay? Here are, caught, before. But I then. We see what——’ Doom, doom came drum-beat walls shook. ‘Slam doors wedge them!’ shouted Aragorn. ‘And keep packs long can: may get chance cut way yet.’ ‘No!’ said Gandalf. ‘We must get shut in. Keep east door ajar! We go way, get chance.’ Another harsh horn-call shrill cries rang out. Feet coming corridor. There ring clatter Company drew swords. Glamdring shone pale light, Sting glinted edges. Boromir set shoulder western door. ‘Wait moment! Do close yet!’ said Gandalf. He sprang forward Boromir’s side drew full height. ‘Who comes hither disturb rest Balin Lord Moria?’ cried loud voice. There rush hoarse laughter, like fall sliding stones pit; amid clamour deep voice raised command. Doom, boom, doom went drums deep. With quick movement Gandalf stepped narrow opening door thrust forward staff. There dazzling flash lit chamber passage outside. For instant wizard looked out. Arrows whined whistled corridor sprang back. ‘There Orcs, many them,’ said. ‘And large evil: black Uruks Mordor. For moment hanging back, something else there. A great cave-troll, I think, one. There hope escape way.’ ‘And hope all, come door well,’ said Boromir. ‘There sound outside yet,’ said Aragorn, standing eastern door listening. ‘The passage side plunges straight stair: plainly lead back towards hall. But good flying blindly way pursuit behind. We cannot block door. Its key gone lock broken, opens inwards. We must something delay enemy first. We make fear Chamber Mazarbul!’ said grimly, feeling edge sword, Andu´ril. Heavy feet heard corridor. Boromir flung door heaved to; wedged broken sword-blades splinters wood. The Company retreated side chamber. But chance fly yet. There blow door made quiver; began grind slowly open, driving back wedges. A huge arm shoulder, dark skin greenish scales, thrust widening gap. Then great, flat, toeless foot forced below. There dead silence outside. Boromir leaped forward hewed arm might; sword rang, glanced aside, fell shaken hand. The blade notched. Suddenly, surprise, Frodo felt hot wrath blaze heart. ‘The Shire!’ cried, springing beside Boromir, stooped, stabbed Sting hideous foot. There bellow, foot jerked back, nearly wrenching Sting Frodo’s arm. Black drops dripped blade smoked floor. Boromir hurled door slammed again. ‘One Shire!’ cried Aragorn. ‘The hobbit’s bite deep! You good blade, Frodo son Drogo!’ There crash door, followed crash crash. Rams hammers beating it. It cracked staggered back, opening grew suddenly wide. Arrows came whistling in, struck northern wall, fell harmlessly floor. There horn-blast rush feet, orcs one another leaped chamber. How many Company could count. The affray sharp, orcs dismayed fierceness defence. Legolas shot two throat. Gimli hewed legs another sprung Balin’s tomb. Boromir Aragorn slew many. When thirteen fallen rest fled shrieking, leaving defenders unharmed, except Sam scratch along scalp. A quick duck saved him; felled orc: sturdy thrust Barrow-blade. A fire smouldering brown eyes would made Ted Sandyman step backwards, seen it. ‘Now time!’ cried Gandalf. ‘Let us go, troll returns!’ But even retreated, Pippin Merry reached stair outside, huge orc-chieftain, almost man-high, clad black mail head foot, leaped chamber; behind followers clustered doorway. His broad flat face swart, eyes like coals, tongue red; wielded great spear. With thrust huge hide shield turned Boromir’s sword bore backwards, throwing ground. Diving Aragorn’s blow speed striking snake charged Company thrust spear straight Frodo. The blow caught right side, Frodo hurled wall pinned. Sam, cry, hacked spear-shaft, broke. But even orc flung truncheon swept scimitar, Andu´ril came upon helm. There flash like flame helm burst asunder. The orc fell cloven head. His followers fled howling, Boromir Aragorn sprang them. Doom, doom went drums deep. The great voice rolled again. ‘Now!’ shouted Gandalf. ‘Now last chance. Run it!’ Aragorn picked Frodo lay wall made stair, pushing Merry Pippin front him. The others followed; Gimli dragged away Legolas: spite peril lingered Balin’s tomb head bowed. Boromir hauled eastern door to, grinding upon hinges: great iron rings either side, could fastened. ‘I right,’ gasped Frodo. ‘I walk. Put down!’ Aragorn nearly dropped amazement. ‘I thought dead!’ cried. ‘Not yet!’ said Gandalf. ‘But time wonder. Off go, you, stairs! Wait minutes bottom, I come soon, go on! Go quickly choose paths leading right downwards.’ ‘We cannot leave hold door alone!’ said Aragorn. ‘Do I say!’ said Gandalf fiercely. ‘Swords use here. Go!’ The passage lit shaft utterly dark. They groped way long flight steps, looked back; could see nothing, except high faint glimmer wizard’s staff. He seemed still standing guard closed door. Frodo breathed heavily leaned Sam, put arms him. They stood peering stairs darkness. Frodo thought could hear voice Gandalf above, muttering words ran sloping roof sighing echo. He could catch said. The walls seemed trembling. Every drum-beats throbbed rolled: doom, doom. Suddenly top stair stab white light. Then dull rumble heavy thud. The drum-beats broke wildly: doom-boom, doom-boom, stopped. Gandalf came flying steps fell ground midst Company. ‘Well, well! That’s over!’ said wizard struggling feet. ‘I done I could. But I met match, nearly destroyed. But don’t stand here! Go on! You without light while: I rather shaken. Go on! Go on! Where you, Gimli? Come ahead me! Keep close behind, you!’ They stumbled wondering happened. Doom, doom went drum-beats again: sounded muffled far away, following. There sound pursuit, neither tramp feet, voice. Gandalf took turns, right left, passage seemed going direction desired. Every descended flight steps, fifty more, lower level. At moment chief danger; dark could see descent, came put feet emptiness. Gandalf felt ground staff like blind man. At end hour gone mile, maybe little more, descended many flights stairs. There still sound pursuit. Almost began hope would escape. At bottom seventh flight Gandalf halted. ‘It getting hot!’ gasped. ‘We ought least level Gates now. Soon I think look left-hand turn take us east. I hope far. I weary. I must rest moment, even orcs ever spawned us.’ Gimli took arm helped seat step. ‘What happened away door?’ asked. ‘Did meet beater drums?’ ‘I know,’ answered Gandalf. ‘But I found suddenly faced something I met before. I could think nothing try put shutting-spell door. I know many; things kind rightly requires time, even door broken strength. ‘As I stood I could hear orc-voices side: moment I thought would burst open. I could hear said; seemed talking hideous language. All I caught ghaˆsh: ‘‘fire’’. Then something came chamber – I felt door, orcs afraid fell silent. It laid hold iron ring, perceived spell. ‘What I cannot guess, I never felt challenge. The counter-spell terrible. It nearly broke me. For instant door left control began open! I speak word Command. That proved great strain. The door burst pieces. Something dark cloud blocking light inside, I thrown backwards stairs. All wall gave way, roof chamber well, I think. ‘I afraid Balin buried deep, maybe something else buried too. I cannot say. But least passage behind us completely blocked. Ah! I never felt spent, passing. And you, Frodo? There time say so, I never delighted life spoke. I feared brave dead hobbit Aragorn carrying.’ ‘What me?’ said Frodo. ‘I alive, whole I think. I bruised pain, bad.’ ‘Well,’ said Aragorn, ‘I say hobbits made stuff tough I never met like it. Had I known, I would spoken softer Inn Bree! That spear-thrust would skewered wild boar!’ ‘Well, skewer me, I glad say,’ said Frodo; ‘though I feel I caught hammer anvil.’ He said more. He found breathing painful. ‘You take Bilbo,’ said Gandalf. ‘There meets eye, I said long ago.’ Frodo wondered remark meant said. They went again. Before long Gimli spoke. He keen eyes dark. ‘I think,’ said, ‘that light ahead. But daylight. It red. What be?’ ‘Ghaˆsh!’ muttered Gandalf. ‘I wonder meant: lower levels fire? Still, go on.’ Soon light became unmistakable, could seen all. It flickering glowing walls away passage them. They could see way: front road sloped swiftly, way ahead stood low archway; growing light came. The air became hot. When came arch Gandalf went through, signing wait. As stood beyond opening saw face lit red glow. Quickly stepped back. ‘There new devilry here,’ said, ‘devised welcome, doubt. But I know are: reached First Deep, level immediately Gates. This Second Hall Old Moria; Gates near: away beyond eastern end, left, quarter mile. Across Bridge, broad stair, along wide road, First Hall, out! But come look!’ They peered out. Before another cavernous hall. It loftier far longer one slept. They near eastern end; westward ran away darkness. Down centre stalked double line towering pillars. They carved like boles mighty trees whose boughs upheld roof branching tracery stone. Their stems smooth black, red glow darkly mirrored sides. Right across floor, close feet two huge pillars great fissure opened. Out fierce red light came, flames licked brink curled bases columns. Wisps dark smoke wavered hot air. ‘If come main road upper halls, trapped here,’ said Gandalf. ‘Let us hope fire lies us pursuit. Come! There time lose.’ Even spoke heard pursuing drum-beat: Doom, doom, doom. Away beyond shadows western end hall came cries horn-calls. Doom, doom: pillars seemed tremble flames quiver. ‘Now last race!’ said Gandalf. ‘If sun shining outside, may still escape. After me!’ He turned left sped across smooth floor hall. The distance greater looked. As ran heard beat echo many hurrying feet behind. A shrill yell went up: seen. There ring clash steel. An arrow whistled Frodo’s head. Boromir laughed. ‘They expect this,’ said. ‘The fire cut off. We wrong side!’ ‘Look ahead!’ called Gandalf. ‘The Bridge near. lt dangerous narrow.’ Suddenly Frodo saw black chasm. At end hall floor vanished fell unknown depth. The outer door could reached slender bridge stone, without kerb rail, spanned chasm one curving spring fifty feet. It ancient defence Dwarves enemy might capture First Hall outer passages. They could pass across single file. At brink Gandalf halted others came pack behind. ‘Lead way, Gimli!’ said. ‘Pippin Merry next. Straight on, stair beyond door!’ Arrows fell among them. One struck Frodo sprang back. Another pierced Gandalf’s hat stuck like black feather. Frodo looked behind. Beyond fire saw swarming black figures: seemed hundreds orcs. They brandished spears scimitars shone red blood firelight. Doom, doom rolled drum-beats, growing louder louder, doom, doom. Legolas turned set arrow string, though long shot small bow. He drew, hand fell, arrow slipped ground. He gave cry dismay fear. Two great trolls appeared; bore great slabs stone, flung serve gangways fire. But trolls filled Elf terror. The ranks orcs opened, crowded away, afraid. Something coming behind them. What could seen: like great shadow, middle dark form, man-shape maybe, yet greater; power terror seemed go it. It came edge fire light faded cloud bent it. Then rush leaped across fissure. The flames roared greet it, wreathed it; black smoke swirled air. Its streaming mane kindled, blazed behind it. In right hand blade like stabbing tongue fire; left held whip many thongs. ‘Ai! ai!’ wailed Legolas. ‘A Balrog! A Balrog come!’ Gimli stared wide eyes. ‘Durin’s Bane!’ cried, letting axe fall covered face. ‘A Balrog,’ muttered Gandalf. ‘Now I understand.’ He faltered leaned heavily staff. ‘What evil fortune! And I already weary.’ The dark figure streaming fire raced towards them. The orcs yelled poured stone gangways. Then Boromir raised horn blew. Loud challenge rang bellowed, like shout many throats cavernous roof. For moment orcs quailed fiery shadow halted. Then echoes died suddenly flame blown dark wind, enemy advanced again. ‘Over bridge!’ cried Gandalf, recalling strength. ‘Fly! This foe beyond you. I must hold narrow way. Fly!’ Aragorn Boromir heed command, still held ground, side side, behind Gandalf far end bridge. The others halted within doorway hall’s end, turned, unable leave leader face enemy alone. The Balrog reached bridge. Gandalf stood middle span, leaning staff left hand, hand Glamdring gleamed, cold white. His enemy halted again, facing him, shadow reached like two vast wings. It raised whip, thongs whined cracked. Fire came nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm. ‘You cannot pass,’ said. The orcs stood still, dead silence fell. ‘I servant Secret Fire, wielder flame Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire avail you, flame Uduˆn. Go back Shadow! You cannot pass.’ The Balrog made answer. The fire seemed die, darkness grew. It stepped forward slowly bridge, suddenly drew great height, wings spread wall wall; still Gandalf could seen, glimmering gloom; seemed small, altogether alone: grey bent, like wizened tree onset storm. From shadow red sword leaped flaming. Glamdring glittered white answer. There ringing clash stab white fire. The Balrog fell back, sword flew molten fragments. The wizard swayed bridge, stepped back pace, stood still. ‘You cannot pass!’ said. With bound Balrog leaped full upon bridge. Its whip whirled hissed. ‘He cannot stand alone!’ cried Aragorn suddenly ran back along bridge. ‘Elendil!’ shouted. ‘I you, Gandalf!’ ‘Gondor!’ cried Boromir leaped him. At moment Gandalf lifted staff, crying aloud smote bridge him. The staff broke asunder fell hand. A blinding sheet white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked. Right Balrog’s feet broke, stone upon stood crashed gulf, rest remained, poised, quivering like tongue rock thrust emptiness. With terrible cry Balrog fell forward, shadow plunged vanished. But even fell swung whip, thongs lashed curled wizard’s knees, dragging brink. He staggered fell, grasped vainly stone, slid abyss. ‘Fly, fools!’ cried, gone. The fires went out, blank darkness fell. The Company stood rooted horror staring pit. Even Aragorn Boromir came flying back, rest bridge cracked fell. With cry Aragorn roused them. ‘Come! I lead now!’ called. ‘We must obey last command. Follow me!’ They stumbled wildly great stairs beyond door, Aragorn leading, Boromir rear. At top wide echoing passage. Along fled. Frodo heard Sam side weeping, found weeping ran. Doom, doom, doom drum-beats rolled behind, mournful slow; doom! They ran on. The light grew them; great shafts pierced roof. They ran swifter. They passed hall, bright daylight high windows east. They fled across it. Through huge broken doors passed, suddenly Great Gates opened, arch blazing light. There guard orcs crouching shadows behind great door-posts towering either side, gates shattered cast down. Aragorn smote ground captain stood path, rest fled terror wrath. The Company swept past took heed them. Out Gates ran sprang huge age-worn steps, threshold Moria. Thus, last, came beyond hope sky felt wind faces. They halt bowshot walls. Dimrill Dale lay them. The shadow Misty Mountains lay upon it, eastwards golden light land. It one hour noon. The sun shining; clouds white high. They looked back. Dark yawned archway Gates mountain-shadow. Faint far beneath earth rolled slow drum-beats: doom. A thin black smoke trailed out. Nothing else seen; dale around empty. Doom. Grief last wholly overcame them, wept long: standing silent, cast upon ground. Doom, doom. The drum-beats faded. Chapter 6 LOTHLO´ RIEN ‘Alas! I fear cannot stay longer,’ said Aragorn. He looked towards mountains held sword. ‘Farewell, Gandalf!’ cried. ‘Did I say you: pass doors Moria, beware? Alas I spoke true! What hope without you?’ He turned Company. ‘We must without hope,’ said. ‘At least may yet avenged. Let us gird weep more! Come! We long road, much do.’ They rose looked them. Northward dale ran glen shadows two great arms mountains, three white peaks shining: Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Caradhras, Mountains Moria. At head glen torrent flowed like white lace endless ladder short falls, mist foam hung air mountains’ feet. ‘Yonder Dimrill Stair,’ said Aragorn, pointing falls. ‘Down deep-cloven way climbs beside torrent come, fortune kinder.’ ‘Or Caradhras less cruel,’ said Gimli. ‘There stands smiling sun!’ He shook fist furthest snow-capped peaks turned away. To east outflung arm mountains marched sudden end, far lands could descried beyond them, wide vague. To south Misty Mountains receded endlessly far sight could reach. Less mile away, little them, still stood high west side dale, lay mere. It long oval, shaped like great spear-head thrust deep northern glen; southern end beyond shadows sunlit sky. Yet waters dark: deep blue like clear evening sky seen lamp-lit room. Its face still unruffled. About lay smooth sward, shelving sides bare unbroken rim. ‘There lies Mirrormere, deep Kheled-zaˆram!’ said Gimli sadly. ‘I remember said: ‘‘May joy sight! But cannot linger there.’’ Now long shall I journey ere I joy again. It I must hasten away, must remain.’ The Company went road Gates. It rough broken, fading winding track heather whin thrust amid cracking stones. But still could seen long ago great paved way wound upwards lowlands Dwarf-kingdom. In places ruined works stone beside path, mounds green topped slender birches, fir-trees sighing wind. An eastward bend led hard sward Mirrormere, far roadside stood single column broken top. ‘That Durin’s Stone!’ cried Gimli. ‘I cannot pass without turning aside moment look wonder dale!’ ‘Be swift then!’ said Aragorn, looking back towards Gates. ‘The Sun sinks early. The Orcs not, maybe, come till dusk, must far away nightfall. The Moon almost spent, dark tonight.’ ‘Come me, Frodo!’ cried dwarf, springing road. ‘I would go without seeing Kheledzaˆram.’ He ran long green slope. Frodo followed slowly, drawn still blue water spite hurt weariness; Sam came behind. Beside standing stone Gimli halted looked up. It cracked weather-worn, faint runes upon side could read. ‘This pillar marks spot Durin first looked Mirrormere,’ said dwarf. ‘Let us look once, ere go!’ They stooped dark water. At first could see nothing. Then slowly saw forms encircling mountains mirrored profound blue, peaks like plumes white flame them; beyond space sky. There like jewels sunk deep shone glinting stars, though sunlight sky above. Of stooping forms shadow could seen. ‘O Kheled-zaˆram fair wonderful!’ said Gimli. ‘There lies Crown Durin till wakes. Farewell!’ He bowed, turned away, hastened back greensward road again. ‘What see?’ said Pippin Sam, Sam deep thought answer. The road turned south went quickly downwards, running arms dale. Some way mere came deep well water, clear crystal, freshet fell stone lip ran glistening gurgling steep rocky channel. ‘Here spring Silverlode rises,’ said Gimli. ‘Do drink it! It icy cold.’ ‘Soon becomes swift river, gathers water many mountain-streams,’ said Aragorn. ‘Our road leads beside many miles. For I shall take road Gandalf chose, first I hope come woods Silverlode flows Great River – yonder.’ They looked pointed, could see stream leaping trough valley, running away lower lands, lost golden haze. ‘There lie woods Lothlo´rien!’ said Legolas. ‘That fairest dwellings people. There trees like trees land. For autumn leaves fall not, turn gold. Not till spring comes new green opens fall, boughs laden yellow flowers; floor wood golden, golden roof, pillars silver, bark trees smooth grey. So still songs Mirkwood say. My heart would glad I beneath eaves wood, springtime!’ ‘My heart glad, even winter,’ said Aragorn. ‘But lies many miles away. Let us hasten!’ For time Frodo Sam managed keep others; Aragorn leading great pace, lagged behind. They eaten nothing since early morning. Sam’s cut burning like fire, head felt light. In spite shining sun wind seemed chill warm darkness Moria. He shivered. Frodo felt every step painful gasped breath. At last Legolas turned, seeing far behind, spoke Aragorn. The others halted, Aragorn ran back, calling Boromir come him. ‘I sorry, Frodo!’ cried, full concern. ‘So much happened day need haste, I forgotten hurt; Sam too. You spoken. We done nothing ease you, ought, though orcs Moria us. Come now! A little place rest little. There I I you. Come, Boromir! We carry them.’ Soon afterwards came upon another stream ran west, joined bubbling water hurrying Silverlode. Together plunged fall green-hued stone, foamed dell. About stood fir-trees, short bent, sides steep clothed harts-tongue shrubs whortle-berry. At bottom level space stream flowed noisily shining pebbles. Here rested. It nearly three hours noon, come miles Gates. Already sun westering. While Gimli two younger hobbits kindled fire brush- fir-wood, drew water, Aragorn tended Sam Frodo. Sam’s wound deep, looked ugly, Aragorn’s face grave examined it. After moment looked relief. ‘Good luck, Sam!’ said. ‘Many received worse payment slaying first orc. The cut poisoned, wounds orc-blades often are. It heal well I tended it. Bathe Gimli heated water.’ He opened pouch drew withered leaves. ‘They dry, virtue gone,’ said, ‘but I still leaves athelas I gathered near Weathertop. Crush one water, wash wound clean, I bind it. Now turn, Frodo!’ ‘I right,’ said Frodo, reluctant garments touched. ‘All I needed food little rest.’ ‘No!’ said Aragorn. ‘We must look see hammer anvil done you. I still marvel alive all.’ Gently stripped Frodo’s old jacket worn tunic, gave gasp wonder. Then laughed. The silver corslet shimmered eyes like light upon rippling sea. Carefully took held up, gems glittered like stars, sound shaken rings like tinkle rain pool. ‘Look, friends!’ called. ‘Here’s pretty hobbit-skin wrap elven-princeling in! If known hobbits hides, hunters Middle-earth would riding Shire.’ ‘And arrows hunters world would vain,’ said Gimli, gazing mail wonder. ‘It mithril-coat. Mithril! I never seen heard tell one fair. Is coat Gandalf spoke of? Then undervalued it. But well given!’ ‘I often wondered Bilbo doing, close little room,’ said Merry. ‘Bless old hobbit! I love ever. I hope get chance telling it!’ There dark blackened bruise Frodo’s right side breast. Under mail shirt soft leather, one point rings driven flesh. Frodo’s left side also scored bruised hurled wall. While others set food ready, Aragorn bathed hurts water athelas steeped. The pungent fragrance filled dell, stooped steaming water felt refreshed strengthened. Soon Frodo felt pain leave him, breath grew easy: though stiff sore touch many days. Aragorn bound soft pads cloth side. ‘The mail marvellously light,’ said. ‘Put again, bear it. My heart glad know coat. Do lay aside, even sleep, unless fortune brings safe while; seldom chance quest lasts.’ When eaten, Company got ready go on. They put fire hid traces it. Then climbing dell took road again. They gone far sun sank behind westward heights great shadows crept mountain-sides. Dusk veiled feet, mist rose hollows. Away east evening light lay pale upon dim lands distant plain wood. Sam Frodo feeling eased greatly refreshed able go fair pace, one brief halt Aragorn led Company nearly three hours. It dark. Deep night fallen. There many clear stars, fast-waning moon would seen till late. Gimli Frodo rear, walking softly speaking, listening sound upon road behind. At length Gimli broke silence. ‘Not sound wind,’ said. ‘There goblins near, ears made wood. It hoped Orcs content driving us Moria. And maybe purpose, nothing else us – Ring. Though Orcs often pursue foes many leagues plain, fallen captain avenge.’ Frodo answer. He looked Sting, blade dull. Yet heard something, thought had. As soon shadows fallen road behind dim, heard quick patter feet. Even heard it. He turned swiftly. There two tiny gleams light behind, moment thought saw them, slipped aside vanished. ‘What it?’ said dwarf. ‘I don’t know,’ answered Frodo. ‘I thought I heard feet, I thought I saw light – like eyes. I thought often, since first entered Moria.’ Gimli halted stooped ground. ‘I hear nothing night-speech plant stone,’ said. ‘Come! Let us hurry! The others sight.’ The night-wind blew chill valley meet them. Before wide grey shadow loomed, heard endless rustle leaves like poplars breeze. ‘Lothlo´rien!’ cried Legolas. ‘Lothlo´rien! We come eaves Golden Wood. Alas winter!’ Under night trees stood tall them, arched road stream ran suddenly beneath spreading boughs. In dim light stars stems grey, quivering leaves hint fallow gold. ‘Lothlo´rien!’ said Aragorn. ‘Glad I hear wind trees! We still little five leagues Gates, go further. Here let us hope virtue Elves keep us tonight peril comes behind.’ ‘If Elves indeed still dwell darkening world,’ said Gimli. ‘It long since folk journeyed hither back land whence wandered ages long ago,’ said Legolas, ‘but hear Lo´rien yet deserted, secret power holds evil land. Nevertheless folk seldom seen, maybe dwell deep woods far northern border.’ ‘Indeed deep wood dwell,’ said Aragorn, sighed memory stirred him. ‘We must fend tonight. We go forward short way, trees us, turn aside path seek place rest in.’ He stepped forward; Boromir stood irresolute follow. ‘Is way?’ said. ‘What fairer way would desire?’ said Aragorn. ‘A plain road, though led hedge swords,’ said Boromir. ‘By strange paths Company led, far evil fortune. Against passed shades Moria, loss. And must enter Golden Wood, say. But perilous land heard Gondor, said come go in; none escaped unscathed.’ ‘Say unscathed, say unchanged, maybe speak truth,’ said Aragorn. ‘But lore wanes Gondor, Boromir, city wise speak evil Lothlo´rien. Believe will, way us – unless would go back Moria-gate, scale pathless mountains, swim Great River alone.’ ‘Then lead on!’ said Boromir. ‘But perilous.’ ‘Perilous indeed,’ said Aragorn, ‘fair perilous; evil need fear it, bring evil them. Follow me!’ They gone little mile forest came upon another stream flowing swiftly tree-clad slopes climbed back westward towards mountains. They heard splashing fall away among shadows right. Its dark hurrying waters ran across path them, joined Silverlode swirl dim pools among roots trees. ‘Here Nimrodel!’ said Legolas. ‘Of stream Silvan Elves made many songs long ago, still sing North, remembering rainbow falls, golden flowers floated foam. All dark Bridge Nimrodel broken down. I bathe feet, said water healing weary.’ He went forward climbed deep-cloven bank stepped stream. ‘Follow me!’ cried. ‘The water deep. Let us wade across! On bank rest, sound falling water may bring us sleep forgetfulness grief.’ One one climbed followed Legolas. For moment Frodo stood near brink let water flow tired feet. It cold touch clean, went mounted knees, felt stain travel weariness washed limbs. When Company crossed, sat rested ate little food; Legolas told tales Lothlo´rien Elves Mirkwood still kept hearts, sunlight starlight upon meadows Great River world grey. At length silence fell, heard music waterfall running sweetly shadows. Almost Frodo fancied could hear voice singing, mingled sound water. ‘Do hear voice Nimrodel?’ asked Legolas. ‘I sing song maiden Nimrodel, bore name stream beside lived long ago. It fair song woodland tongue; runs Westron Speech, Rivendell sing it.’ In soft voice hardly heard amid rustle leaves began: An Elven-maid old, A shining star day: Her mantle white hemmed gold, Her shoes silver-grey. A star bound upon brows, A light hair As sun upon golden boughs In Lo´rien fair. Her hair long, limbs white, And fair free; And wind went light As leaf linden-tree. Beside falls Nimrodel, By water clear cool, Her voice falling silver fell Into shining pool. Where wanders none tell, In sunlight shade; For lost yore Nimrodel And mountains strayed. The elven-ship grey Beneath mountain-lee Awaited many day Beside roaring sea. A wind night Northern lands Arose, loud cried, And drove ship elven-strands Across streaming tide. When dawn came dim land lost, The mountains sinking grey Beyond heaving waves tossed Their plumes blinding spray. Amroth beheld fading shore Now low beyond swell, And cursed faithless ship bore Him far Nimrodel. Of old Elven-king, A lord tree glen, When golden boughs spring In fair Lothlo´rien. From helm sea saw leap, As arrow string, And dive water deep, As mew upon wing. The wind flowing hair, The foam shone; Afar saw strong fair Go riding like swan. But West come word, And Hither Shore No tidings Elven-folk heard Of Amroth evermore. The voice Legolas faltered, song ceased. ‘I cannot sing more,’ said. ‘That part, I forgotten much. It long sad, tells sorrow came upon Lothlo´rien, Lo´rien Blossom, Dwarves awakened evil mountains.’ ‘But Dwarves make evil,’ said Gimli. ‘I said so; yet evil came,’ answered Legolas sadly. ‘Then many Elves Nimrodel’s kindred left dwellings departed, lost far South, passes White Mountains; came ship Amroth lover waited her. But spring wind new leaves echo voice may still heard falls bear name. And wind South voice Amroth comes sea; Nimrodel flows Silverlode, Elves call Celebrant, Celebrant Anduin Great, Anduin flows Bay Belfalas whence Elves Lo´rien set sail. But neither Nimrodel Amroth came ever back. ‘It told house built branches tree grew near falls; custom Elves Lo´rien, dwell trees, maybe still. Therefore called Galadhrim, Tree-people. Deep forest trees great. The people woods delve ground like Dwarves, build strong places stone Shadow came.’ ‘And even latter days dwelling trees might thought safer sitting ground,’ said Gimli. He looked across stream road led back Dimrill Dale, roof dark boughs above. ‘Your words bring good counsel, Gimli,’ said Aragorn. ‘We cannot build house, tonight Galadhrim seek refuge tree-tops, can. We sat beside road already longer wise.’ The Company turned aside path, went shadow deeper woods, westward along mountain-stream away Silverlode. Not far falls Nimrodel found cluster trees, overhung stream. Their great grey trunks mighty girth, height could guessed. ‘I climb up,’ said Legolas. ‘I home among trees, root bough, though trees kind strange me, save name song. Mellyrn called, bear yellow blossom, I never climbed one. I see shape way growth.’ ‘Whatever may be,’ said Pippin, ‘they marvellous trees indeed offer rest night, except birds. I cannot sleep perch!’ ‘Then dig hole ground,’ said Legolas, ‘if afterthefashionofyourkind.Butyoumustdigswiftanddeep, wish hide Orcs.’ He sprang lightly ground caught branch grew trunk high head. But even swung moment, voice spoke suddenly tree-shadows him. ‘Daro!’ said commanding tone, Legolas dropped back earth surprise fear. He shrank bole tree. ‘Stand still!’ whispered others. ‘Do move speak!’ There sound soft laughter heads, another clear voice spoke elven-tongue. Frodo could understand little said, speech Silvan folk east mountains used among unlike West. Legolas looked answered language.* ‘Who they, say?’ asked Merry. ‘They’re Elves,’ said Sam. ‘Can’t hear voices?’ ‘Yes, Elves,’ said Legolas; ‘and say breathe loud could shoot dark.’ Sam hastily put hand mouth. ‘But say also need fear. They aware us long while. They heard voice across Nimrodel, knew I one Northern kindred, therefore hinder crossing; afterwards heard song. Now bid climb Frodo; seem tidings journey. The others ask wait little, keep watch foot tree, decided done.’ * * * * See note Appendix F: Of Elves. Out shadows ladder let down: made rope, silver-grey glimmering dark, though looked slender proved strong enough bear many men. Legolas ran lightly up, Frodo followed slowly; behind came Sam trying breathe loudly. The branches mallorn-tree grew nearly straight trunk, swept upward; near top main stem divided crown many boughs, among found built wooden platform, flet things called days: Elves called talan. It reached round hole centre ladder passed. When Frodo came last flet found Legolas seated three Elves. They clad shadowygrey, could seen among tree-stems, unless moved suddenly. They stood up, one uncovered small lamp gave slender silver beam. He held up, looking Frodo’s face, Sam’s. Then shut light again, spoke words welcome elven-tongue. Frodo spoke haltingly return. ‘Welcome!’ Elf said Common Language, speaking slowly. ‘We seldom use tongue own; dwell heart forest, willingly dealings folk. Even kindred North sundered us. But us still go abroad gathering news watching enemies, speak languages lands. I one. Haldir name. My brothers, Ru´mil Orophin, speak little tongue. ‘But heard rumours coming, messengers Elrond passed Lo´rien way home Dimrill Stair. We heard – hobbits, halflings, many long year, know yet dwelt Middle-earth. You look evil! And since come Elf kindred, willing befriend you, Elrond asked; though custom lead strangers land. But must stay tonight. How many you?’ ‘Eight,’ said Legolas. ‘Myself, four hobbits; two men, one whom, Aragorn, Elf-friend folk Westernesse.’ ‘The name Aragorn son Arathorn known Lo´rien,’ said Haldir, ‘and favour Lady. All well. But yet spoken seven.’ ‘The eighth dwarf,’ said Legolas. ‘A dwarf!’ said Haldir. ‘That well. We dealings Dwarves since Dark Days. They permitted land. I cannot allow pass.’ ‘But Lonely Mountain, one Da´in’s trusty people, friendly Elrond,’ said Frodo. ‘Elrond chose one companions, brave faithful.’ The Elves spoke together soft voices, questioned Legolas tongue. ‘Very good,’ said Haldir last. ‘We this, though liking. If Aragorn Legolas guard him, answer him, shall pass; must go blindfold Lothlo´rien. ‘But must debate longer. Your folk must remain ground. We keeping watch rivers, ever since saw great troop Orcs going north towards Moria, along skirts mountains, many days ago. Wolves howling wood’s borders. If indeed come Moria, peril cannot far behind. Tomorrow early must go on. ‘The four hobbits shall climb stay us – fear them! There another talan next tree. There others must take refuge. You, Legolas, must answer us them. Call us, anything amiss! And eye dwarf!’ Legolas went ladder take Haldir’s message; soon afterwards Merry Pippin clambered high flet. They breath seemed rather scared. ‘There!’ said Merry panting. ‘We lugged blankets well own. Strider hidden rest baggage deep drift leaves.’ ‘You need burdens,’ said Haldir. ‘It cold tree-tops winter, though wind tonight South; food drink give drive away night-chill, skins cloaks spare.’ The hobbits accepted second (and far better) supper gladly. Then wrapped warmly, fur-cloaks Elves, blankets well, tried go sleep. But weary Sam found easy do. Hobbits like heights, sleep upstairs, even stairs. The flet liking bedroom. It walls, even rail; one side light plaited screen, could moved fixed different places according wind. Pippin went talking while. ‘I hope, I go sleep bird-loft, I shan’t roll off,’ said. ‘Once I get sleep,’ said Sam, ‘I shall go sleeping, whether I roll no. And less said, sooner I’ll drop off, take meaning.’ Frodo lay time awake, looked stars glinting pale roof quivering leaves. Sam snoring side long closed eyes. He could dimly see grey forms two elves sitting motionless arms knees, speaking whispers. The gone take watch one lower branches. At last lulled wind boughs above, sweet murmur falls Nimrodel below, Frodo fell asleep song Legolas running mind. Late night woke. The hobbits asleep. The Elves gone. The sickle Moon gleaming dimly among leaves. The wind still. A little way heard harsh laugh tread many feet ground below. There ring metal. The sounds died slowly away, seemed go southward, wood. A head appeared suddenly hole flet. Frodo sat alarm saw grey-hooded Elf. He looked towards hobbits. ‘What it?’ said Frodo. ‘Yrch!’ said Elf hissing whisper, cast flet rope-ladder rolled up. ‘Orcs!’ said Frodo. ‘What doing?’ But Elf gone. There sounds. Even leaves silent, falls seemed hushed. Frodo sat shivered wraps. He thankful caught ground; felt trees offered little protection, except concealment. Orcs keen hounds scent, said, could also climb. He drew Sting: flashed glittered like blue flame; slowly faded grew dull. In spite fading sword feeling immediate danger leave Frodo, rather grew stronger. He got crawled opening peered down. He almost certain could hear stealthy movements tree’s foot far below. Not Elves; woodland folk altogether noiseless movements. Then heard faintly sound like sniffing; something seemed scrabbling bark tree-trunk. He stared dark, holding breath. Something climbing slowly, breath came like soft hissing closed teeth. Then coming up, close stem, Frodo saw two pale eyes. They stopped gazed upward unwinking. Suddenly turned away, shadowy figure slipped round trunk tree vanished. Immediately afterwards Haldir came climbing swiftly branches. ‘There something tree I never seen before,’ said. ‘It orc. It fled soon I touched tree-stem. It seemed wary, skill trees, I might thought one hobbits. ‘I shoot, I dared arouse cries: cannot risk battle. A strong company Orcs passed. They crossed Nimrodel – curse foul feet clean water! – went old road beside river. They seemed pick scent, searched ground near place halted. The three us could challenge hundred, went ahead spoke feigned voices, leading wood. ‘Orophin gone haste back dwellings warn people. None Orcs ever return Lo´rien. And many Elves hidden northern border another night falls. But must take road south soon fully light.’ Day came pale East. As light grew filtered yellow leaves mallorn, seemed hobbits early sun cool summer’s morning shining. Pale-blue sky peeped among moving branches. Looking opening south side flet Frodo saw valley Silverlode lying like sea fallow gold tossing gently breeze. The morning still young cold Company set again, guided Haldir brother Ru´mil. ‘Farewell, sweet Nimrodel!’ cried Legolas. Frodo looked back caught gleam white foam among grey tree-stems. ‘Farewell,’ said. It seemed would never hear running water beautiful, ever blending innumerable notes endless changeful music. They went back path still went along west side Silverlode, way followed southward. There prints orc-feet earth. But soon Haldir turned aside trees halted bank river shadows. ‘There one people yonder across stream,’ said, ‘though may see him.’ He gave call like low whistle bird, thicket young trees Elf stepped, clad grey, hood thrown back; hair glinted like gold morning sun. Haldir skilfully cast stream coil grey rope, caught bound end tree near bank. ‘Celebrant already strong stream here, see,’ said Haldir, ‘and runs swift deep, cold. We set foot far north, unless must. But days watchfulness make bridges. This cross! Follow me!’ He made end rope fast another tree, ran lightly along it, river back again, road. ‘I walk path,’ said Legolas; ‘but others skill. Must swim?’ ‘No!’ said Haldir. ‘We two ropes. We fasten other, one shoulder-high, another halfhigh, holding strangers able cross care.’ When slender bridge made, Company passed over, cautiously slowly, others easily. Of hobbits Pippin proved best sure-footed, walked quickly, holding one hand; kept eyes bank ahead look down. Sam shuffled along, clutching hard, looking pale eddying water chasm mountains. He breathed relief safely across. ‘Live learn! gaffer used say. Though thinking gardening, roosting like bird, trying walk like spider. Not even uncle Andy ever trick like that!’ When length Company gathered east bank Silverlode, Elves untied ropes coiled two them. Ru´mil, remained side, drew back last one, slung shoulder, wave hand went away, back Nimrodel keep watch. ‘Now, friends,’ said Haldir, ‘you entered Naith Lo´rien, Gore, would say, land lies like spearhead arms Silverlode Anduin Great. We allow strangers spy secrets Naith. Few indeed permitted even set foot there. ‘As agreed, I shall blindfold eyes Gimli Dwarf. The others may walk free while, come nearer dwellings, Egladil, Angle waters.’ ThiswasnotatalltothelikingofGimli.‘Theagreementwas made without consent,’ said. ‘I walk blindfold, likeabeggaroraprisoner.AndIamnospy.Myfolkhavenever dealings servants Enemy. Neither done harm Elves. I likely betray Legolas, companions.’ ‘I doubt you,’ said Haldir. ‘Yet law. I master law, cannot set aside. I done much letting set foot Celebrant.’ Gimli obstinate. He planted feet firmly apart, laid hand upon haft axe. ‘I go forward free,’ said, ‘or I go back seek land, I known true word, though I perish alone wilderness.’ ‘You cannot go back,’ said Haldir sternly. ‘Now come thus far, must brought Lord Lady. They shall judge you, hold give leave, will. You cannot cross rivers again, behind secret sentinels cannot pass. You would slain saw them.’ Gimli drew axe belt. Haldir companion bent bows. ‘A plague Dwarves stiff necks!’ said Legolas. ‘Come!’ said Aragorn. ‘If I still lead Company, must I bid. It hard upon Dwarf thus singled out. We blindfold, even Legolas. That best, though make journey slow dull.’ Gimli laughed suddenly. ‘A merry troop fools shall look! Will Haldir lead us string, like many blind beggars one dog? But I content, Legolas shares blindness.’ ‘I Elf kinsman here,’ said Legolas, becoming angry turn. ‘Now let us cry: ‘‘a plague stiff necks Elves!’’’ said Aragorn. ‘But Company shall fare alike. Come, bind eyes, Haldir!’ ‘I shall claim full amends every fall stubbed toe, lead us well,’ said Gimli bound cloth eyes. ‘You claim,’ said Haldir. ‘I shall lead well, paths smooth straight.’ ‘Alas folly days!’ said Legolas. ‘Here enemies one Enemy, yet I must walk blind, sun merry woodland leaves gold!’ ‘Folly may seem,’ said Haldir. ‘Indeed nothing power Dark Lord clearly shown estrangement divides still oppose him. Yet little faith trust find world beyond Lothlo´rien, unless maybe Rivendell, dare trust endanger land. We live upon island amid many perils, hands often upon bowstring upon harp. ‘The rivers long defended us, sure guard more; Shadow crept northward us. Some speak departing, yet already seems late. The mountains west growing evil; east lands waste, full Sauron’s creatures; rumoured cannot safely pass southward Rohan, mouths Great River watched Enemy. Even could come shores Sea, find longer shelter there. It said still havens High Elves, far north west, beyond land Halflings. But may be, though Lord Lady may know, I not.’ ‘You ought least guess, since seen us,’ said Merry. ‘There Elf-havens west land, Shire, Hobbits live.’ ‘Happy folk Hobbits dwell near shores sea!’ said Haldir. ‘It long indeed since folk looked it, yet still remember song. Tell havens walk.’ ‘I cannot,’ said Merry. ‘I never seen them. I never land before. And I known world outside like, I don’t think I heart leave it.’ ‘Not even see fair Lothlo´rien?’ said Haldir. ‘The world indeed full peril, many dark places; still much fair, though lands love mingled grief, grows perhaps greater. ‘Some among us sing Shadow draw back, peace shall come again. Yet I believe world us ever old, light Sun aforetime. For Elves, I fear, prove best truce, may pass Sea unhindered leave Middle-earth ever. Alas Lothlo´rien I love! It would poor life land mallorn grew. But mallorn-trees beyond Great Sea, none reported it.’ As spoke thus, Company filed slowly along paths wood, led Haldir, Elf walked behind. They felt ground beneath feet smooth soft, walked freely, without fear hurt fall. Being deprived sight, Frodo found hearing senses sharpened. He could smell trees trodden grass. He could hear many different notes rustle leaves overhead, river murmuring away right, thin clear voices birds high sky. He felt sun upon face hands passed open glade. As soon set foot upon far bank Silverlode strange feeling come upon him, deepened walked Naith: seemed stepped bridge time corner Elder Days, walking world more. In Rivendell memory ancient things; Lo´rien ancient things still lived waking world. Evil seen heard there, sorrow known; Elves feared distrusted world outside: wolves howling wood’s borders: land Lo´rien shadow lay. All day Company marched on, felt cool evening come heard early night-wind whispering among many leaves. Then rested slept without fear upon ground; guides would permit unbind eyes, could climb. In morning went again, walking without haste. At noon halted, Frodo aware passed shining Sun. Suddenly heard sound many voices around him. A marching host Elves come silently: hastening towards northern borders guard attack Moria; brought news, Haldir reported. The marauding orcs waylaid almost destroyed; remnant fled westward towards mountains, pursued. A strange creature also seen, running bent back hands near ground, like beast yet beast-shape. It eluded capture, shot it, knowing whether good ill, vanished Silverlode southward. ‘Also,’ said Haldir, ‘they bring message Lord Lady Galadhrim. You walk free, even dwarf Gimli. It seems Lady knows member Company. New messages come Rivendell perhaps.’ He removed bandage first Gimli’s eyes. ‘Your pardon!’ said, bowing low. ‘Look us friendly eyes! Look glad, first dwarf behold trees Naith Lo´rien since Durin’s Day!’ When eyes turn uncovered, Frodo looked caught breath. They standing open space. To left stood great mound, covered sward grass green Springtime Elder Days. Upon it, double crown, grew two circles trees: outer bark snowy white, leafless beautiful shapely nakedness; inner mallorn-trees great height, still arrayed pale gold. High amid branches towering tree stood centre gleamed white flet. At feet trees, green hillsides grass studded small golden flowers shaped like stars. Among them, nodding slender stalks, flowers, white palest green: glimmered mist amid rich hue grass. Over sky blue, sun afternoon glowed upon hill cast long green shadows beneath trees. ‘Behold! You come Cerin Amroth,’ said Haldir. ‘For heart ancient realm long ago, mound Amroth, happier days high house built. Here ever bloom winter flowers unfading grass: yellow elanor, pale niphredil. Here stay awhile, come city Galadhrim dusk.’ The others cast upon fragrant grass, Frodo stood awhile still lost wonder. It seemed stepped high window looked vanished world. A light upon language name. All saw shapely, shapes seemed clear cut, first conceived drawn uncovering eyes, ancient endured ever. He saw colour knew, gold white blue green, fresh poignant, moment first perceived made names new wonderful. In winter heart could mourn summer spring. No blemish sickness deformity could seen anything grew upon earth. On land Lo´rien stain. He turned saw Sam standing beside him, looking round puzzled expression, rubbing eyes sure awake. ‘It’s sunlight bright day, right enough,’ said. ‘I thought Elves moon stars: Elvish anything I ever heard tell of. I feel I inside song, take meaning.’ Haldir looked them, seemed indeed take meaning thought word. He smiled. ‘You feel power Lady Galadhrim,’ said. ‘Would please climb Cerin Amroth?’ They followed stepped lightly grass-clad slopes. Though walked breathed, living leaves flowers stirred cool wind fanned face, Frodo felt timeless land fade change fall forgetfulness. When gone passed outer world, still Frodo wanderer Shire would walk there, upon grass among elanor niphredil fair Lothlo´rien. They entered circle white trees. As South Wind blew upon Cerin Amroth sighed among branches. Frodo stood still, hearing far great seas upon beaches long ago washed away, sea-birds crying whose race perished earth. Haldir gone climbing high flet. As Frodo prepared follow him, laid hand upon tree beside ladder: never suddenly keenly aware feel texture tree’s skin life within it. He felt delight wood touch it, neither forester carpenter; delight living tree itself. As stepped last upon lofty platform, Haldir took hand turned towards South. ‘Look way first!’ said. Frodo looked saw, still distance, hill many mighty trees, city green towers: could tell. Out it, seemed power light came held land sway. He longed suddenly fly like bird rest green city. Then looked eastward saw land Lo´rien running pale gleam Anduin, Great River. He lifted eyes across river light went out, back world knew. Beyond river land appeared flat empty, formless vague, far away rose like wall, dark drear. The sun lay Lothlo´rien power enlighten shadow distant height. ‘There lies fastness Southern Mirkwood,’ said Haldir. ‘It clad forest dark fir, trees strive one another branches rot wither. In midst upon stony height stands Dol Guldur, long hidden Enemy dwelling. We fear inhabited again, power sevenfold. A black cloud lies often late. In high place may see two powers opposed one another; ever strive thought, whereas light perceives heart darkness, secret discovered. Not yet.’ He turned climbed swiftly down, followed him. At hill’s foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still silent tree; hand small golden bloom elanor, light eyes. He wrapped fair memory: Frodo looked knew beheld things place. For grim years removed face Aragorn, seemed clothed white, young lord tall fair; spoke words Elvish tongue one Frodo could see. Arwen vanimelda, nama´rie¨! said, drew breath, returning thought looked Frodo smiled. ‘Here heart Elvendom earth,’ said, ‘and heart dwells ever, unless light beyond dark roads still must tread, I. Come me!’ And taking Frodo’s hand his, left hill Cerin Amroth came never living man. Chapter 7 THE MIRROR OF GALADRIEL The sun sinking behind mountains, shadows deepening woods, went again. Their paths went thickets dusk already gathered. Night came beneath trees walked, Elves uncovered silver lamps. Suddenly came open found pale evening sky pricked early stars. There wide treeless space them, running great circle bending away either hand. Beyond deep fosse lost soft shadow, grass upon brink green, glowed still memory sun gone. Upon side rose great height green wall encircling green hill thronged mallorn-trees taller yet seen land. Their height could guessed, stood twilight like living towers. In many-tiered branches amid ever-moving leaves countless lights gleaming, green gold silver. Haldir turned towards Company. ‘Welcome Caras Galadhon!’ said. ‘Here city Galadhrim dwell Lord Celeborn Galadriel Lady Lo´rien. But cannot enter here, gates look northward. We must go round southern side, way short, city great.’ There road paved white stone running outer brink fosse. Along went westward, city ever climbing like green cloud upon left; night deepened lights sprang forth, hill seemed afire stars. They came last white bridge, crossing found great gates city: faced south-west, set ends encircling wall overlapped, tall strong, hung many lamps. Haldir knocked spoke, gates opened soundlessly; guards Frodo could see sign. The travellers passed within, gates shut behind them. They deep lane ends wall, passing quickly entered City Trees. No folk could see, hear feet upon paths; many voices, them, air above. Far away hill could hear sound singing falling high like soft rain upon leaves. They went along many paths climbed many stairs, came high places saw amid wide lawn fountain shimmering. It lit silver lamps swung boughs trees, fell basin silver, white stream spilled. Upon south side lawn stood mightiest trees; great smooth bole gleamed like grey silk, towered, first branches, far above, opened huge limbs shadowy clouds leaves. Beside broad white ladder stood, foot three Elves seated. They sprang travellers approached, Frodo saw tall clad grey mail, shoulders hung long white cloaks. ‘Here dwell Celeborn Galadriel,’ said Haldir. ‘It wish ascend speak them.’ One Elf-wardens blew clear note small horn, answered three times far above. ‘I go first,’ said Haldir. ‘Let Frodo come next Legolas. The others may follow wish. It long climb accustomed stairs, may rest upon way.’ As climbed slowly Frodo passed many flets: one side, another, set bole tree, ladder passed them. At great height ground came wide talan, like deck great ship. On built house, large almost would served hall Men upon earth. He entered behind Haldir, found chamber oval shape, midst grew trunk great mallorn, tapering towards crown, yet making still pillar wide girth. The chamber filled soft light; walls green silver roof gold. Many Elves seated there. On two chairs beneath bole tree canopied living bough sat, side side, Celeborn Galadriel. They stood greet guests, manner Elves, even accounted mighty kings. Very tall were, Lady less tall Lord; grave beautiful. They clad wholly white; hair Lady deep gold, hair Lord Celeborn silver long bright; sign age upon them, unless depths eyes; keen lances starlight, yet profound, wells deep memory. Haldir led Frodo them, Lord welcomed tongue. The Lady Galadriel said word looked long upon face. ‘Sit beside chair, Frodo Shire!’ said Celeborn. ‘When come speak together.’ Each companions greeted courteously name entered. ‘Welcome Aragorn son Arathorn!’ said. ‘It eight thirty years world outside since came land; years lie heavy you. But end near, good ill. Here lay aside burden while!’ ‘Welcome son Thranduil! Too seldom kindred journey hither North.’ ‘Welcome Gimli son Glo´in! It long indeed since saw one Durin’s folk Caras Galadhon. But today broken long law. May sign though world dark better days hand, friendship shall renewed peoples.’ Gimli bowed low. When guests seated chair Lord looked again. ‘Here eight,’ said. ‘Nine set out: said messages. But maybe change counsel heard. Elrond far away, darkness gathers us, year shadows grown longer.’ ‘Nay, change counsel,’ said Lady Galadriel, speaking first time. Her voice clear musical, deeper woman’s wont. ‘Gandalf Grey set Company, pass borders land. Now tell us is; I much desired speak again. But I cannot see afar, unless comes within fences Lothlo´rien: grey mist him, ways feet mind hidden me.’ ‘Alas!’ said Aragorn. ‘Gandalf Grey fell shadow. He remained Moria escape.’ At words Elves hall cried aloud grief amazement. ‘These evil tidings,’ said Celeborn, ‘the evil spoken long years full grievous deeds.’ He turned Haldir. ‘Why nothing told before?’ asked elven-tongue. ‘We spoken Haldir deeds purpose,’ said Legolas. ‘At first weary danger close behind; afterwards almost forgot grief time, walked gladness fair paths Lo´rien.’ ‘Yet grief great loss cannot mended,’ said Frodo. ‘Gandalf guide, led us Moria; escape seemed beyond hope saved us, fell.’ ‘Tell us full tale!’ said Celeborn. Then Aragorn recounted happened upon pass Caradhras, days followed; spoke Balin book, fight Chamber Mazarbul, fire, narrow bridge, coming Terror. ‘An evil Ancient World seemed, I never seen before,’ said Aragorn. ‘It shadow flame, strong terrible.’ ‘It Balrog Morgoth,’ said Legolas; ‘of elf-banes deadly, save One sits Dark Tower.’ ‘Indeed I saw upon bridge haunts darkest dreams, I saw Durin’s Bane,’ said Gimli low voice, dread eyes. ‘Alas!’ said Celeborn. ‘We long feared Caradhras terror slept. But I known Dwarves stirred evil Moria again, I would forbidden pass northern borders, went you. And possible, one would say last Gandalf fell wisdom folly, going needlessly net Moria.’ ‘He would rash indeed said thing,’ said Galadriel gravely. ‘Needless none deeds Gandalf life. Those followed knew mind cannot report full purpose. But however may guide, followers blameless. Do repent welcome Dwarf. If folk exiled long far Lothlo´rien, Galadhrim, even Celeborn Wise, would pass nigh would wish look upon ancient home, though become abode dragons? ‘Dark water Kheled-zaˆram, cold springs Kibil-naˆla, fair many-pillared halls Khazad-duˆm Elder Days fall mighty kings beneath stone.’ She looked upon Gimli, sat glowering sad, smiled. And Dwarf, hearing names given ancient tongue, looked met eyes; seemed looked suddenly heart enemy saw love understanding. Wonder came face, smiled answer. He rose clumsily bowed dwarf-fashion, saying: ‘Yet fair living land Lo´rien, Lady Galadriel jewels lie beneath earth!’ There silence. At length Celeborn spoke again. ‘I know plight evil,’ said. ‘Let Gimli forget harsh words: I spoke trouble heart. I I aid you, according wish need, especially one little folk bears burden.’ ‘Your quest known us,’ said Galadriel, looking Frodo. ‘But speak openly. Yet vain prove, maybe, came land seeking aid, Gandalf plainly purposed. For Lord Galadhrim accounted wisest Elves Middleearth, giver gifts beyond power kings. He dwelt West since days dawn, I dwelt years uncounted; ere fall Nargothrond Gondolin I passed mountains, together ages world fought long defeat. ‘I first summoned White Council. And designs gone amiss, would governed Gandalf Grey, mayhap things would gone otherwise. But even hope left. I give counsel, saying this, that. For contriving, choosing course another, I avail; knowing is, part also shall be. But I say you: Quest stands upon edge knife. Stray little fail, ruin all. Yet hope remains Company true.’ And word held eyes, silence looked searchingly turn. None save Legolas Aragorn could long endure glance. Sam quickly blushed hung head. At length Lady Galadriel released eyes, smiled. ‘Do let hearts troubled,’ said. ‘Tonight shall sleep peace.’ Then sighed felt suddenly weary, questioned long deeply, though words spoken openly. ‘Go now!’ said Celeborn. ‘You worn sorrow much toil. Even Quest concern us closely, refuge City, healed refreshed. Now shall rest, speak road while.’ That night Company slept upon ground, much satisfaction hobbits. The Elves spread pavilion among trees near fountain, laid soft couches; speaking words peace fair Elvish voices left them. For little travellers talked night tree-tops, day’s journey, Lord Lady; yet heart look back. ‘What blush for, Sam?’ said Pippin. ‘You soon broke down. Anyone would thought guilty conscience. I hope nothing worse wicked plot steal one blankets.’ ‘I never thought thing,’ answered Sam, mood jest. ‘If want know, I felt I hadn’t got nothing on, I didn’t like it. She seemed looking inside asking I would gave chance flying back home Shire nice little hole – bit garden own.’ ‘That’s funny,’ said Merry. ‘Almost exactly I felt myself; only, well, I don’t think I’ll say more,’ ended lamely. All them, seemed, fared alike: felt offered choice shadow full fear lay ahead, something greatly desired: clear mind lay, get turn aside road leave Quest war Sauron others. ‘And seemed me, too,’ said Gimli, ‘that choice would remain secret known myself.’ ‘To seemed exceedingly strange,’ said Boromir. ‘Maybe test, thought read thoughts good purpose; almost I said tempting us, offering pretended power give. It need said I refused listen. The Men Minas Tirith true word.’ But thought Lady offered Boromir tell. And Frodo, would speak, though Boromir pressed questions. ‘She held long gaze, Ring-bearer,’ said. ‘Yes,’ said Frodo; ‘but whatever came mind I keep there.’ ‘Well, care!’ said Boromir. ‘I feel sure Elvish Lady purposes.’ ‘Speak evil Lady Galadriel!’ said Aragorn sternly. ‘You know say. There land evil, unless man bring hither himself. Then let beware! But tonight I shall sleep without fear first time since I left Rivendell. And may I sleep deep, forget grief! I weary body heart.’ He cast upon couch fell long sleep. The others soon same, sound dream disturbed slumber. When woke found light day broad upon lawn pavilion, fountain rose fell glittering sun. They remained days Lothlo´rien, far could tell remember. All dwelt sun shone clear, save gentle rain fell times, passed away leaving things fresh clean. The air cool soft, early spring, yet felt deep thoughtful quiet winter. It seemed little eat drink rest, walk among trees; enough. They seen Lord Lady again, little speech Elven-folk; knew would use Westron tongue. Haldir bidden farewell gone back fences North, great watch kept since tidings Moria Company brought. Legolas away much among Galadhrim, first night sleep companions, though returned eat talk them. Often took Gimli went abroad land, others wondered change. Now companions sat walked together spoke Gandalf, known seen came clear minds. As healed hurt weariness body grief loss grew keen. Often heard nearby Elvish voices singing, knew making songs lamentation fall, caught name among sweet sad words could understand. Mithrandir, Mithrandir sang Elves, O Pilgrim Grey! For loved call him. But Legolas Company, would interpret songs them, saying skill, grief still near, matter tears yet song. It Frodo first put something sorrow halting words. He seldom moved make song rhyme; even Rivendell listened sung himself, though memory stored many things others made him. But sat beside fountain Lo´rien heard voices Elves, thought took shape song seemed fair him; yet tried repeat Sam snatches remained, faded handful withered leaves. When evening Shire grey footsteps Hill heard; dawn went away journey long without word. From Wilderland Western shore, northern waste southern hill, dragon-lair hidden door darkling woods walked will. With Dwarf Hobbit, Elves Men, mortal immortal folk, bird bough beast den, secret tongues spoke. A deadly sword, healing hand, back bent beneath load; trumpet-voice, burning brand, weary pilgrim road. A lord wisdom throned sat, swift anger, quick laugh; old man battered hat leaned upon thorny staff. He stood upon bridge alone Fire Shadow defied; staff broken stone, Khazad-duˆm wisdom died. ‘Why, you’ll beating Mr. Bilbo next!’ said Sam. ‘No, I afraid not,’ said Frodo. ‘But best I yet.’ ‘Well, Mr. Frodo, another go, I hope you’ll say word fireworks,’ said Sam. ‘Something like this: The finest rockets ever seen: burst stars blue green, thunder golden showers came falling like rain flowers. Though doesn’t justice long road.’ ‘No, I’ll leave you, Sam. Or perhaps Bilbo. But – well, I can’t talk more. I can’t bear think bringing news him.’ One evening Frodo Sam walking together cool twilight. Both felt restless again. On Frodo suddenly shadow parting fallen: knew somehow time near must leave Lothlo´rien. ‘What think Elves now, Sam?’ said. ‘I asked question – seems long ago; seen since then.’ ‘I indeed!’ said Sam. ‘And I reckon there’s Elves Elves. They’re Elvish enough, they’re same. Now folk aren’t wanderers homeless, seem bit nearer likes us: seem belong here, even Hobbits Shire. Whether they’ve made land, land’s made them, it’s hard say, take meaning. It’s wonderfully quiet here. Nothing seems going on, nobody seems want to. If there’s magic about, it’s right deep, I can’t lay hands it, manner speaking.’ ‘You see feel everywhere,’ said Frodo. ‘Well,’ said Sam, ‘you can’t see nobody working it. No fireworks like poor old Gandalf used show. I wonder don’t see nothing Lord Lady days. I fancy could wonderful things, mind. I’d dearly love see Elf-magic, Mr. Frodo!’ ‘I wouldn’t,’ said Frodo. ‘I content. And I don’t miss Gandalf’s fireworks, bushy eyebrows, quick temper, voice.’ ‘You’re right,’ said Sam. ‘And don’t think I’m finding fault. I’ve often wanted see bit magic like tells old tales, I’ve never heard better land this. It’s like home holiday time, understand me. I don’t want leave. All same, I’m beginning feel we’ve got go on, we’d best get over. ‘It’s job that’s never started takes longest finish, old gaffer used say. And I don’t reckon folk much help us, magic no. It’s leave land shall miss Gandalf worse, I’m thinking.’ ‘I afraid that’s true, Sam,’ said Frodo. ‘Yet I hope much leave shall see Lady Elves again.’ Even spoke, saw, came answer words, Lady Galadriel approaching. Tall white fair walked beneath trees. She spoke word, beckoned them. Turning aside, led towards southern slopes hill Caras Galadhon, passing high green hedge came enclosed garden. No trees grew there, lay open sky. The evening star risen shining white fire western woods. Down long flight steps Lady went deep green hollow, ran murmuring silver stream issued fountain hill. At bottom, upon low pedestal carved like branching tree, stood basin silver, wide shallow, beside stood silver ewer. With water stream Galadriel filled basin brim, breathed it, water still spoke. ‘Here Mirror Galadriel,’ said. ‘I brought may look it, will.’ The air still, dell dark, Elflady beside tall pale. ‘What shall look for, shall see?’ asked Frodo, filled awe. ‘Many things I command Mirror reveal,’ answered, ‘and I show desire see. But Mirror also show things unbidden, often stranger profitable things wish behold. What see, leave Mirror free work, I cannot tell. For shows things were, things are, things yet may be. But sees, even wisest cannot always tell. Do wish look?’ Frodo answer. ‘And you?’ said, turning Sam. ‘For folk would call magic, I believe; though I understand clearly mean; seem use word deceits Enemy. But this, will, magic Galadriel. Did say wished see Elf-magic?’ ‘I did,’ said Sam, trembling little fear curiosity. ‘I’ll peep, Lady, you’re willing. ‘And I’d mind glimpse what’s going home,’ said aside Frodo. ‘It seems terrible long time I’ve away. But there, like I’ll see stars, something I won’t understand.’ ‘Like not,’ said Lady gentle laugh. ‘But come, shall look see may. Do touch water!’ Sam climbed foot pedestal leaned basin. The water looked hard dark. Stars reflected it. ‘There’s stars, I thought,’ said. Then gave low gasp, stars went out. As dark veil withdrawn, Mirror grew grey, clear. There sun shining, branches trees waving tossing wind. But Sam could make mind saw, light faded; thought saw Frodo pale face lying fast asleep great dark cliff. Then seemed see going along dim passage, climbing endless winding stair. It came suddenly looking urgently something, know. Like dream vision shifted went back, saw trees again. But time close, could see going on: waving wind, falling, crashing ground. ‘Hi!’ cried Sam outraged voice. ‘There’s Ted Sandyman a-cutting trees shouldn’t. They didn’t ought felled: it’s avenue beyond Mill shades road Bywater. I wish I could get Ted, I’d fell him!’ But Sam noticed Old Mill vanished, large red-brick building put stood. Lots folk busily work. There tall red chimney nearby. Black smoke seemed cloud surface Mirror. ‘There’s devilry work Shire,’ said. ‘Elrond knew wanted send Mr. Merry back.’ Then suddenly Sam gave cry sprang away. ‘I can’t stay here,’ said wildly. ‘I must go home. They’ve dug Bagshot Row, there’s poor old Gaffer going Hill bits things barrow. I must go home!’ ‘You cannot go home alone,’ said Lady. ‘You wish go home without master looked Mirror, yet knew evil things might well happening Shire. Remember Mirror shows many things, yet come pass. Some never come be, unless behold visions turn aside path prevent them. The Mirror dangerous guide deeds.’ Sam sat ground put head hands. ‘I wish I never come here, I don’t want see magic,’ said fell silent. After moment spoke thickly, struggling tears. ‘No, I’ll go home long road Mr. Frodo, all,’ said. ‘But I hope I get back day. If I’ve seen turns true, somebody’s going catch hot!’ ‘Do wish look, Frodo?’ said Lady Galadriel. ‘You wish see Elf-magic content.’ ‘Do advise look?’ asked Frodo. ‘No,’ said. ‘I counsel one way other. I counsellor. You may learn something, whether see fair evil, may profitable, yet may not. Seeing good perilous. Yet I think, Frodo, courage wisdom enough venture, I would brought here. Do will!’ ‘I look,’ said Frodo, climbed pedestal bent dark water. At Mirror cleared saw twilit land. Mountains loomed dark distance pale sky. A long grey road wound back sight. Far away figure came slowly road, faint small first, growing larger clearer approached. Suddenly Frodo realized reminded Gandalf. He almost called aloud wizard’s name, saw figure clothed grey white, white shone faintly dusk; hand white staff. The head bowed could see face, presently figure turned aside round bend road went Mirror’s view. Doubt came Frodo’s mind: vision Gandalf one many lonely journeys long ago, Saruman? The vision changed. Brief small vivid caught glimpse Bilbo walking restlessly room. The table littered disordered papers; rain beating windows. Then pause, many swift scenes followed Frodo way knew parts great history become involved. The mist cleared saw sight never seen knew once: Sea. Darkness fell. The sea rose raged great storm. Then saw Sun, sinking blood-red wrack clouds, black outline tall ship torn sails riding West. Then wide river flowing populous city. Then white fortress seven towers. And ship black sails, morning again, water rippled light, banner bearing emblem white tree shone sun. A smoke fire battle arose, sun went burning red faded grey mist; mist small ship passed away, twinkling lights. It vanished, Frodo sighed prepared draw away. But suddenly Mirror went altogether dark, dark hole opened world sight, Frodo looked emptiness. In black abyss appeared single Eye slowly grew, filled nearly Mirror. So terrible Frodo stood rooted, unable cry withdraw gaze. The Eye rimmed fire, glazed, yellow cat’s, watchful intent, black slit pupil opened pit, window nothing. Then Eye began rove, searching way that; Frodo knew certainty horror among many things sought one. But also knew could see – yet, unless willed it. The Ring hung upon chain neck grew heavy, heavier great stone, head dragged downwards. The Mirror seemed growing hot curls steam rising water. He slipping forward. ‘Do touch water!’ said Lady Galadriel softly. The vision faded, Frodo found looking cool stars twinkling silver basin. He stepped back shaking looked Lady. ‘I know last saw,’ said; ‘for also mind. Do afraid! But think singing amid trees, even slender arrows elven-bows, land Lothlo´rien maintained defended Enemy. I say you, Frodo, even I speak you, I perceive Dark Lord know mind, mind concerns Elves. And gropes ever see thought. But still door closed!’ She lifted white arms, spread hands towards East gesture rejection denial. Ea¨rendil, Evening Star, beloved Elves, shone clear above. So bright figure Elven-lady cast dim shadow ground. Its rays glanced upon ring finger; glittered like polished gold overlaid silver light, white stone twinkled Evenstar come rest upon hand. Frodo gazed ring awe; suddenly seemed understood. ‘Yes,’ said, divining thought, ‘it permitted speak it, Elrond could so. But cannot hidden Ring-bearer, one seen Eye. Verily land Lo´rien upon finger Galadriel one Three remains. This Nenya, Ring Adamant, I keeper. ‘He suspects, know – yet. Do see wherefore coming us footstep Doom? For fail, laid bare Enemy. Yet succeed, power diminished, Lothlo´rien fade, tides Time sweep away. We must depart West, dwindle rustic folk dell cave, slowly forget forgotten.’ Frodo bent head. ‘And wish?’ said last. ‘That shall be,’ answered. ‘The love Elves land works deeper deeps Sea, regret undying cannot ever wholly assuaged. Yet cast away rather submit Sauron: know now. For fate Lothlo´rien answerable, task. Yet I could wish, avail, One Ring never wrought, remained ever lost.’ ‘You wise fearless fair, Lady Galadriel,’ said Frodo. ‘I give One Ring, ask it. It great matter me.’ Galadriel laughed sudden clear laugh. ‘Wise Lady Galadriel may be,’ said, ‘yet met match courtesy. Gently revenged testing heart first meeting. You begin see keen eye. I deny heart greatly desired ask offer. For many long years I pondered I might do, Great Ring come hands, behold! brought within grasp. The evil devised long ago works many ways, whether Sauron stands falls. Would noble deed set credit Ring, I taken force fear guest? ‘And last comes. You give Ring freely! In place Dark Lord set Queen. And I shall dark, beautiful terrible Morning Night! Fair Sea Sun Snow upon Mountain! Dreadful Storm Lightning! Stronger foundations earth. All shall love despair!’ She lifted hand ring wore issued great light illumined alone left else dark. She stood Frodo seeming tall beyond measurement, beautiful beyond enduring, terrible worshipful. Then let hand fall, light faded, suddenly laughed again, lo! shrunken: slender elf-woman, clad simple white, whose gentle voice soft sad. ‘I pass test,’ said. ‘I diminish, go West, remain Galadriel.’ They stood long silence. At length Lady spoke again. ‘Let us return!’ said. ‘In morning must depart, chosen, tides fate flowing.’ ‘I would ask one thing go,’ said Frodo, ‘a thing I often meant ask Gandalf Rivendell. I permitted wear One Ring: cannot I see others know thoughts wear them?’ ‘You tried,’ said. ‘Only thrice set Ring upon finger since knew possessed. Do try! It would destroy you. Did Gandalf tell rings give power according measure possessor? Before could use power would need become far stronger, train domination others. Yet even so, Ring-bearer one borne finger seen hidden, sight grown keener. You perceived thought clearly many accounted wise. You saw Eye holds Seven Nine. And see recognize ring upon finger? Did see ring?’ asked turning Sam. ‘No, Lady,’ answered. ‘To tell truth, I wondered talking about. I saw star fingers. But you’ll pardon speaking out, I think master right. I wish you’d take Ring. You’d put things rights. You’d stop digging Gaffer turning adrift. You’d make folk pay dirty work.’ ‘I would,’ said. ‘That would begin. But would stop that, alas! We speak it. Let us go!’ Chapter 8 FAREWELL TO LO´ RIEN That night Company summoned chamber Celeborn, Lord Lady greeted fair words. At length Celeborn spoke departure. ‘Now time,’ said, ‘when wish continue Quest must harden hearts leave land. Those longer wish go forward may remain here, while. But whether stay go, none sure peace. For come edge doom. Here wish may await oncoming hour till either ways world lie open again, summon last need Lo´rien. Then may return lands, else go long home fall battle.’ There silence. ‘They resolved go forward,’ said Galadriel looking eyes. ‘As me,’ said Boromir, ‘my way home lies onward back.’ ‘That true,’ said Celeborn, ‘but Company going Minas Tirith?’ ‘We decided course,’ said Aragorn. ‘Beyond Lothlo´rien I know Gandalf intended do. Indeed I think even clear purpose.’ ‘Maybe not,’ said Celeborn, ‘yet leave land, longer forget Great River. As know well, cannot crossed travellers baggage Lo´rien Gondor, save boat. And bridges Osgiliath broken landings held Enemy? ‘On side journey? The way Minas Tirith lies upon side, upon west; straight road Quest lies east River, upon darker shore. Which shore take?’ ‘If advice heeded, western shore, way Minas Tirith,’ answered Boromir. ‘But I leader Company.’ The others said nothing, Aragorn looked doubtful troubled. ‘I see yet know do,’ said Celeborn. ‘It part choose you; I help I may. There among handle boats: Legolas, whose folk know swift Forest River; Boromir Gondor; Aragorn traveller.’ ‘And one Hobbit!’ cried Merry. ‘Not us look boats wild horses. My people live banks Brandywine.’ ‘That well,’ said Celeborn. ‘Then I furnish Company boats. They must small light, go far water, places forced carry them. You come rapids Sarn Gebir, maybe last great falls Rauros River thunders Nen Hithoel; perils. Boats may make journey less toilsome while. Yet give counsel: end must leave River, turn west – east.’ Aragorn thanked Celeborn many times. The gift boats comforted much, least would need decide course days. The others, too, looked hopeful. Whatever perils lay ahead, seemed better float broad tide Anduin meet plod forward bent backs. Only Sam doubtful: rate still thought boats bad wild horses, worse, dangers survived made think better them. ‘All shall prepared await noon tomorrow,’ said Celeborn. ‘I send people morning help make ready journey. Now wish fair night untroubled sleep.’ ‘Good night, friends!’ said Galadriel. ‘Sleep peace! Do trouble hearts overmuch thought road tonight. Maybe paths shall tread already laid feet, though see them. Good night!’ The Company took leave returned pavilion. Legolas went them, last night Lothlo´rien, spite words Galadriel wished take counsel together. For long time debated do, would best attempt fulfilling purpose Ring; came decision. It plain desired go first Minas Tirith, escape least terror Enemy. They would willing follow leader River shadow Mordor; Frodo spoke word, Aragorn still divided mind. His plan, Gandalf remained them, go Boromir, sword help deliver Gondor. For believed message dreams summons, hour come last heir Elendil come forth strive Sauron mastery. But Moria burden Gandalf laid him; knew could forsake Ring, Frodo refused end go Boromir. And yet help could Company give Frodo, save walk blindly darkness? ‘I shall go Minas Tirith, alone need be, duty,’ said Boromir; silent while, sitting eyes fixed Frodo, trying read Halfling’s thoughts. At length spoke again, softly, debating himself. ‘If wish destroy Ring,’ said, ‘then little use war weapons; Men Minas Tirith cannot help. But wish destroy armed might Dark Lord, folly go without force domain; folly throw away.’ He paused suddenly, become aware speaking thoughts aloud. ‘It would folly throw lives away, I mean,’ ended. ‘It choice defending strong place walking openly arms death. At least, I see it.’ Frodo caught something new strange Boromir’s glance, looked hard him. Plainly Boromir’s thought different final words. It would folly throw away: what? The Ring Power? He said something like Council, accepted correction Elrond. Frodo looked Aragorn, seemed deep thought made sign heeded Boromir’s words. And debate ended. Merry Pippin already asleep, Sam nodding. The night growing old. In morning, beginning pack slender goods, Elves could speak tongue came brought many gifts food clothing journey. The food mostly form thin cakes, made meal baked light brown outside, inside colour cream. Gimli took one cakes looked doubtful eye. ‘Cram,’ said breath, broke crisp corner nibbled it. His expression quickly changed, ate rest cake relish. ‘No more, more!’ cried Elves laughing. ‘You eaten enough already long day’s march.’ ‘I thought kind cram, Dale-men make journeys wild,’ said Dwarf. ‘So is,’ answered. ‘But call lembas waybread, strengthening food made Men, pleasant cram, accounts.’ ‘Indeed is,’ said Gimli. ‘Why, better honeycakes Beornings, great praise, Beornings best bakers I know of; none willing deal cakes travellers days. You kindly hosts!’ ‘All same, bid spare food,’ said. ‘Eat little time, need. For things given serve else fails. The cakes keep sweet many many days, unbroken left leaf-wrappings, brought them. One keep traveller feet day long labour, even one tall Men Minas Tirith.’ The Elves next unwrapped gave Company clothes brought. For provided hood cloak, made according size, light warm silken stuff Galadhrim wove. It hard say colour were: grey hue twilight trees seemed be; yet moved, set another light, green shadowed leaves, brown fallow fields night, dusksilver water stars. Each cloak fastened neck brooch like green leaf veined silver. ‘Are magic cloaks?’ asked Pippin, looking wonder. ‘I know mean that,’ answered leader Elves. ‘They fair garments, web good, made land. They Elvish robes certainly, mean. Leaf branch, water stone: hue beauty things twilight Lo´rien love; put thought love make. Yet garments, armour, turn shaft blade. But serve well: light wear, warm enough cool enough need. And find great aid keeping sight unfriendly eyes, whether walk among stones trees. You indeed high favour Lady! For maidens wove stuff; never clad strangers garb people.’ After morning meal Company said farewell lawn fountain. Their hearts heavy; fair place, become like home them, though could count days nights passed there. As stood moment looking white water sunlight, Haldir came walking towards green grass glade. Frodo greeted delight. ‘I returned Northern Fences,’ said Elf, ‘and I sent guide again. The Dimrill Dale full vapour clouds smoke, mountains troubled. There noises deeps earth. If thought returning northwards homes, would able pass way. But come! Your path goes south.’ As walked Caras Galadhon green ways empty; trees many voices murmuring singing. They went silently. At last Haldir led southward slopes hill, came great gate hung lamps, white bridge; passed left city Elves. Then turned away paved road took path went deep thicket mallorntrees, passed on, winding rolling woodlands silver shadow, leading ever down, southwards eastwards, towards shores River. They gone ten miles noon hand came high green wall. Passing opening came suddenly trees. Before lay long lawn shining grass, studded golden elanor glinted sun. The lawn ran narrow tongue bright margins: right west Silverlode flowed glittering; left east Great River rolled broad waters, deep dark. On shores woodlands still marched southwards far eye could see, banks bleak bare. No mallorn lifted gold-hung boughs beyond Land Lo´rien. On bank Silverlode, distance meeting streams, hythe white stones white wood. By moored many boats barges. Some brightly painted, shone silver gold green, either white grey. Three small grey boats made ready travellers, Elves stowed goods. And added also coils rope, three boat. Slender looked, strong, silken touch, grey hue like elven-cloaks. ‘What these?’ asked Sam, handling one lay upon greensward. ‘Ropes indeed!’ answered Elf boats. ‘Never travel far without rope! And one long strong light. Such these. They may help many needs.’ ‘You don’t need tell that!’ said Sam. ‘I came without any, I’ve worried ever since. But I wondering made of, knowing bit rope-making: it’s family might say.’ ‘They made hithlain,’ said Elf, ‘but time instruct art making. Had known craft delighted you, could taught much. But alas! unless time return hither, must content gift. May serve well!’ ‘Come!’ said Haldir. ‘All ready you. Enter boats! But take care first!’ ‘Heed words!’ said Elves. ‘These boats light-built, crafty unlike boats folk. They sink, lade will; wayward mishandled. It would wise accustomed stepping out, landing-place, set downstream.’ The Company arranged way: Aragorn, Frodo, Sam one boat; Boromir, Merry, Pippin another; third Legolas Gimli, become fast friends. In last boat goods packs stowed. The boats moved steered short-handled paddles broad leaf-shaped blades. When ready Aragorn led trial Silverlode. The current swift went forward slowly. Sam sat bows, clutching sides, looking back wistfully shore. The sunlight glittering water dazzled eyes. As passed beyond green field Tongue, trees drew river’s brink. Here golden leaves tossed floated rippling stream. The air bright still, silence, except high distant song larks. They turned sharp bend river, there, sailing proudly stream towards them, saw swan great size. The water rippled either side white breast beneath curving neck. Its beak shone like burnished gold, eyes glinted like jet set yellow stones; huge white wings half lifted. A music came river drew nearer; suddenly perceived ship, wrought carved elven-skill likeness bird. Two elves clad white steered black paddles. In midst vessel sat Celeborn, behind stood Galadriel, tall white; circlet golden flowers hair, hand held harp, sang. Sad sweet sound voice cool clear air: I sang leaves, leaves gold, leaves gold grew: Of wind I sang, wind came branches blew. Beyond Sun, beyond Moon, foam Sea, And strand Ilmarin grew golden Tree. Beneath stars Ever-eve Eldamar shone, In Eldamar beside walls Elven Tirion. There long golden leaves grown upon branching years, While beyond Sundering Seas fall Elventears. O Lo´rien! The Winter comes, bare leafless Day; The leaves falling stream, River flows away. O Lo´rien! Too long I dwelt upon Hither Shore And fading crown twined golden elanor. But ships I sing, ship would come me, What ship would bear ever back across wide Sea? Aragorn stayed boat Swan-ship drew alongside. The Lady ended song greeted them. ‘We come bid last farewell,’ said, ‘and speed blessings land.’ ‘Though guests,’ said Celeborn, ‘you yet eaten us, bid you, therefore, parting feast, flowing waters bear far Lo´rien.’ The Swan passed slowly hythe, turned boats followed it. There last end Egladil upon green grass parting feast held; Frodo ate drank little, heeding beauty Lady voice. She seemed longer perilous terrible, filled hidden power. Already seemed him, men later days Elves still times seen: present yet remote, living vision already left far behind flowing streams Time. After eaten drunk, sitting upon grass, Celeborn spoke journey, lifting hand pointed south woods beyond Tongue. ‘As go water,’ said, ‘you find trees fail, come barren country. There River flows stony vales amid high moors, last many leagues comes tall island Tindrock, call Tol Brandir. There casts arms steep shores isle, falls great noise smoke cataracts Rauros Nindalf, Wetwang called tongue. That wide region sluggish fen stream becomes tortuous much divided. There Entwash flows many mouths Forest Fangorn west. About stream, side Great River, lies Rohan. On side bleak hills Emyn Muil. The wind blows East there, look Dead Marshes Noman-lands Cirith Gorgor black gates Mordor. ‘Boromir, go seeking Minas Tirith, well leave Great River Rauros cross Entwash finds marshes. Yet go far stream, risk becoming entangled Forest Fangorn. That strange land, little known. But Boromir Aragorn doubtless need warning.’ ‘Indeed heard Fangorn Minas Tirith,’ said Boromir. ‘But I heard seems part old wives’ tales, tell children. All lies north Rohan us far away fancy wander freely there. Of old Fangorn lay upon borders realm; many lives men since us visited it, prove disprove legends come distant years. ‘I whiles Rohan, I never crossed northwards. When I sent messenger, I passed Gap skirts White Mountains, crossed Isen Greyflood Northerland. A long wearisome journey. Four hundred leagues I reckoned it, took many months; I lost horse Tharbad, fording Greyflood. After journey, road I trodden Company, I much doubt I shall find way Rohan, Fangorn too, need be.’ ‘Then I need say more,’ said Celeborn. ‘But despise lore come distant years; oft may chance old wives keep memory word things needful wise know.’ Now Galadriel rose grass, taking cup one maidens filled white mead gave Celeborn. ‘Now time drink cup farewell,’ said. ‘Drink, Lord Galadhrim! And let heart sad, though night must follow noon, already evening draweth nigh.’ Then brought cup Company, bade drink farewell. But drunk commanded sit grass, chairs set Celeborn. Her maidens stood silent her, looked upon guests. At last spoke again. ‘We drunk cup parting,’ said, ‘and shadows fall us. But go, I brought ship gifts Lord Lady Galadhrim offer memory Lothlo´rien.’ Then called turn. ‘Here gift Celeborn Galadriel leader Company,’ said Aragorn, gave sheath made fit sword. It overlaid tracery flowers leaves wrought silver gold, set elven-runes formed many gems name Andu´ril lineage sword. ‘The blade drawn sheath shall stained broken even defeat,’ said. ‘But aught else desire parting? For darkness flow us, may shall meet again, unless far hence upon road returning.’ And Aragorn answered: ‘Lady, know desire, long held keeping treasure I seek. Yet give me, even would; darkness shall I come it.’ ‘Yet maybe lighten heart,’ said Galadriel; ‘for left care given you, pass land.’ Then lifted lap great stone clear green, set silver brooch wrought likeness eagle outspread wings; held gem flashed like sun shining leaves spring. ‘This stone I gave Celebrı´an daughter, hers; comes token hope. In hour take name foretold you, Elessar, Elfstone House Elendil!’ Then Aragorn took stone pinned brooch upon breast, saw wondered; marked tall kingly stood, seemed many years toil fallen shoulders. ‘For gifts given I thank you,’ said, ‘O Lady Lo´rien sprung Celebrı´an Arwen Evenstar. What praise could I say more?’ The Lady bowed head, turned Boromir, gave belt gold; Merry Pippin gave small silver belts, clasp wrought like golden flower. To Legolas gave bow Galadhrim used, longer stouter bows Mirkwood, strung string elf-hair. With went quiver arrows. ‘For little gardener lover trees,’ said Sam, ‘I small gift.’ She put hand little box plain grey wood, unadorned save single silver rune upon lid. ‘Here set G Galadriel,’ said; ‘but also may stand garden tongue. In box earth orchard, blessing Galadriel still bestow upon it. It keep road, defend peril; keep see home last, perhaps may reward you. Though find barren laid waste, gardens Middle-earth bloom like garden, sprinkle earth there. Then may remember Galadriel, catch glimpse far Lo´rien, seen winter. For Spring Summer gone by, never seen earth save memory.’ Sam went red ears muttered something inaudible, clutched box bowed well could. ‘And gift would Dwarf ask Elves?’ said Galadriel, turning Gimli. ‘None, Lady,’ answered Gimli. ‘It enough seen Lady Galadhrim, heard gentle words.’ ‘Hear ye Elves!’ cried her. ‘Let none say Dwarves grasping ungracious! Yet surely, Gimli son Glo´in, desire something I could give? Name it, I bid you! You shall guest without gift.’ ‘There nothing, Lady Galadriel,’ said Gimli, bowing low stammering. ‘Nothing, unless might – unless permitted ask, nay, name single strand hair, surpasses gold earth stars surpass gems mine. I ask gift. But commanded name desire.’ The Elves stirred murmured astonishment, Celeborn gazed Dwarf wonder, Lady smiled. ‘It said skill Dwarves hands rather tongues,’ said; ‘yet true Gimli. For none ever made request bold yet courteous. And shall I refuse, since I commanded speak? But tell me, would gift?’ ‘Treasure it, Lady,’ answered, ‘in memory words first meeting. And ever I return smithies home, shall set imperishable crystal heirloom house, pledge good Mountain Wood end days.’ Then Lady unbraided one long tresses, cut three golden hairs, laid Gimli’s hand. ‘These words shall go gift,’ said. ‘I foretell, foretelling vain: one hand lies darkness, hope. But hope fail, I say you, Gimli son Glo´in, hands shall flow gold, yet gold shall dominion. ‘And you, Ring-bearer,’ said, turning Frodo. ‘I come last last thoughts. For I prepared this.’ She held small crystal phial: glittered moved it, rays white light sprang hand. ‘In phial,’ said, ‘is caught light Ea¨rendil’s star, set amid waters fountain. It shine still brighter night you. May light dark places, lights go out. Remember Galadriel Mirror!’ Frodo took phial, moment shone them, saw standing like queen, great beautiful, longer terrible. He bowed, found words say. Now Lady arose, Celeborn led back hythe. A yellow noon lay green land Tongue, water glittered silver. All last made ready. The Company took places boats before. Crying farewell, Elves Lo´rien long grey poles thrust flowing stream, rippling waters bore slowly away. The travellers sat still without moving speaking. On green bank near point Tongue Lady Galadriel stood alone silent. As passed turned eyes watched slowly floating away them. For seemed them: Lo´rien slipping backward, like bright ship masted enchanted trees, sailing forgotten shores, sat helpless upon margin grey leafless world. Even gazed, Silverlode passed currents Great River, boats turned began speed southward. Soon white form Lady small distant. She shone like window glass upon far hill westering sun, remote lake seen mountain: crystal fallen lap land. Then seemed Frodo lifted arms final farewell, far piercing-clear following wind came sound voice singing. But sang ancient tongue Elves beyond Sea, understand words: fair music, comfort him. Yet way Elvish words, remained graven memory, long afterwards interpreted them, well could: language Elven-song spoke things little known Middle-earth. Ai! laurie¨ lantar lassi su´rinen, ye´ni u´no´time¨ ra´mar aldaron!

Now lost, lost East Valimar! Farewell! Maybe thou shalt find Valimar. Maybe even thou shalt find it. Farewell!’ Varda name Lady Elves lands exile name Elbereth. Suddenly River swept round bend, banks rose upon either side, light Lo´rien hidden. To fair land Frodo never came again. The travellers turned faces journey; sun them, eyes dazzled, filled tears. Gimli wept openly. ‘I looked last upon fairest,’ said Legolas companion. ‘Henceforward I call nothing fair, unless gift.’ He put hand breast. ‘Tell me, Legolas, I come Quest? Little I know chief peril lay! Truly Elrond spoke, saying could foresee might meet upon road. Torment dark danger I feared, hold back. But I would come, I known danger light joy. Now I taken worst wound parting, even I go night straight Dark Lord. Alas Gimli son Glo´in!’ ‘Nay!’ said Legolas. ‘Alas us all! And walk world after-days. For way it: find lose, seems whose boat running stream. But I count blessed, Gimli son Glo´in: loss suffer free will, might chosen otherwise. But forsaken companions, least reward shall memory Lothlo´rien shall remain ever clear unstained heart, shall neither fade grow stale.’ ‘Maybe,’ said Gimli; ‘and I thank words. True words doubtless; yet comfort cold. Memory heart desires. That mirror, clear Kheled-zaˆram. Or says heart Gimli Dwarf. Elves may see things otherwise. Indeed I heard memory like waking world dream. Not Dwarves. ‘But let us talk it. Look boat! She low water baggage, Great River swift. I wish drown grief cold water.’ He took paddle, steered towards western bank, following Aragorn’s boat ahead, already moved middle stream. So Company went long way, wide hurrying waters, borne ever southwards. Bare woods stalked along either bank, could see glimpse lands behind. The breeze died away River flowed without sound. No voice bird broke silence. The sun grew misty day grew old, gleamed pale sky like high white pearl. Then faded West, dusk came early, followed grey starless night. Far dark quiet hours floated on, guiding boats overhanging shadows western woods. Great trees passed like ghosts, thrusting twisted thirsty roots mist water. It dreary cold. Frodo sat listened faint lap gurgle River fretting among tree-roots driftwood near shore, head nodded fell uneasy sleep. Chapter 9 THE GREAT RIVER Frodo roused Sam. He found lying, well wrapped, tall grey-skinned trees quiet corner woodlands west bank Great River, Anduin. He slept night away, grey morning dim among bare branches. Gimli busy small fire near hand. They started day broad. Not Company eager hurry southwards: content decision, must make latest came Rauros Tindrock Isle, still lay days ahead; let River bear pace, desire hasten towards perils lay beyond, whichever course took end. Aragorn let drift stream wished, husbanding strength weariness come. But insisted least start early day journey far evening; felt heart time pressing, feared Dark Lord idle lingered Lo´rien. Nonetheless saw sign enemy day, next. The dull grey hours passed without event. As third day voyage wore lands changed slowly: trees thinned failed altogether. On eastern bank left saw long formless slopes stretching away towards sky; brown withered looked, fire passed them, leaving living blade green: unfriendly waste without even broken tree bold stone relieve emptiness. They come Brown Lands lay, vast desolate, Southern Mirkwood hills Emyn Muil. What pestilence war evil deed Enemy blasted region even Aragorn could tell. Upon west right land treeless also, flat, many places green wide plains grass. On side River passed forests great reeds, tall shut view west, little boats went rustling along fluttering borders. Their dark withered plumes bent tossed light cold airs, hissing softly sadly. Here openings Frodo could catch sudden glimpses rolling meads, far beyond hills sunset, away edge sight dark line, marched southernmost ranks Misty Mountains. There sign living moving things, save birds. Of many: small fowl whistling piping reeds, seldom seen. Once twice travellers heard rush whine swan-wings, looking saw great phalanx streaming along sky. ‘Swans!’ said Sam. ‘And mighty big ones too!’ ‘Yes,’ said Aragorn, ‘and black swans.’ ‘How wide empty mournful country looks!’ said Frodo. ‘I always imagined one journeyed south got warmer merrier, winter left behind ever.’ ‘But journeyed far south yet,’ answered Aragorn. ‘It still winter, far sea. Here world cold sudden spring, may yet snow again. Far away Bay Belfalas, Anduin runs, warm merry, maybe, would Enemy. But sixty leagues, I guess, south Southfarthing away Shire, hundreds long miles yonder. You looking south-west across north plains Riddermark, Rohan land Horse-lords. Ere long shall come mouth Limlight runs Fangorn join Great River. That north boundary Rohan; old lay Limlight White Mountains belonged Rohirrim. It rich pleasant land, grass rival; evil days folk dwell River ride often shores. Anduin wide, yet orcs shoot arrows far across stream; late, said, dared cross water raid herds studs Rohan.’ Sam looked bank bank uneasily. The trees seemed hostile before, harboured secret eyes lurking dangers; wished trees still there. He felt Company naked, afloat little open boats midst shelterless lands, river frontier war. In next day two, went on, borne steadily southwards, feeling insecurity grew Company. For whole day took paddles hastened forward. The banks slid by. Soon River broadened grew shallow; long stony beaches lay upon east, gravel-shoals water, careful steering needed. The Brown Lands rose bleak wolds, flowed chill air East. On side meads become rolling downs withered grass amidst land fen tussock. Frodo shivered, thinking lawns fountains, clear sun gentle rains Lothlo´rien. There little speech laughter boats. Each member Company busy thoughts. The heart Legolas running stars summer night northern glade amid beech-woods; Gimli fingering gold mind, wondering fit wrought housing Lady’s gift. Merry Pippin middle boat ill ease, Boromir sat muttering himself, sometimes biting nails, restlessness doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing paddle driving boat close behind Aragorn’s. Then Pippin, sat bow looking back, caught queer gleam eye, peered forward gazing Frodo. Sam long ago made mind that, though boats maybe dangerous brought believe, far uncomfortable even imagined. He cramped miserable, nothing stare winter-lands crawling grey water either side him. Even paddles use trust Sam one. As dusk drew fourth day, looking back bowed heads Frodo Aragorn following boats; drowsy longed camp feel earth toes. Suddenly something caught sight: first stared listlessly, sat rubbed eyes; looked could see more. That night camped small eyot close western bank. Sam lay rolled blankets beside Frodo. ‘I funny dream hour two stopped, Mr. Frodo,’ said. ‘Or maybe wasn’t dream. Funny anyway.’ ‘Well, it?’ said Frodo, knowing Sam would settle told tale, whatever was. ‘I haven’t seen thought anything make smile since left Lothlo´rien.’ ‘It wasn’t funny way, Mr. Frodo. It queer. All wrong, wasn’t dream. And best hear it. It like this: I saw log eyes!’ ‘The log’s right,’ said Frodo. ‘There many River. But leave eyes!’ ‘That I won’t,’ said Sam. ‘’Twas eyes made sit up, speak. I saw I took log floating along half-light behind Gimli’s boat; I didn’t give much heed it. Then seemed log slowly catching us up. And peculiar, might say, seeing floating stream together. Just I saw eyes: two pale sort points, shiny-like, hump near end log. What’s more, wasn’t log, paddle-feet, like swan’s almost, seemed bigger, kept dipping water. ‘That’s I sat right rubbed eyes, meaning give shout, still I rubbed drowse head. For whatever-it-was coming along fast getting close behind Gimli. But whether two lamps spotted moving staring, whether I came senses, I don’t know. When I looked again, wasn’t there. Yet I think I caught glimpse, tail eye, saying is, something dark shooting shadow bank. I couldn’t see eyes, though. ‘I said myself: ‘‘dreaming again, Sam Gamgee,’’ I said; I said then. But I’ve thinking since, I’m sure. What make it, Mr. Frodo?’ ‘I make nothing log dusk sleep eyes, Sam,’ said Frodo, ‘if first time eyes seen. But isn’t. I saw away back north reached Lo´rien. And I saw strange creature eyes climbing flet night. Haldir saw too. And remember report Elves went orc-band?’ ‘Ah,’ said Sam, ‘I do; I remember too. I don’t like thoughts; thinking one thing another, Mr. Bilbo’s stories all, I fancy I could put name creature, guess. A nasty name. Gollum, maybe?’ ‘Yes, I feared time,’ said Frodo. ‘Ever since night flet. I suppose lurking Moria, picked trail then; I hoped stay Lo´rien would throw scent again. The miserable creature must hiding woods Silverlode, watching us start off!’ ‘That’s it,’ said Sam. ‘And we’d better bit watchful ourselves, we’ll feel nasty fingers round necks one nights, ever wake feel anything. And that’s I leading to. No need trouble Strider others tonight. I’ll keep watch. I sleep tomorrow, luggage boat, might say.’ ‘I might,’ said Frodo, ‘and I might say ‘‘luggage eyes’’. You shall watch; promise wake half-way towards morning, nothing happens then.’ In dead hours Frodo came deep dark sleep find Sam shaking him. ‘It’s shame wake you,’ whispered Sam, ‘but that’s said. There’s nothing tell, much. I thought I heard soft plashing sniffing noise, back; hear lot queer sounds river night.’ He lay down, Frodo sat up, huddled blankets, fought sleep. Minutes hours passed slowly, nothing happened. Frodo yielding temptation lie dark shape, hardly visible, floated close one moored boats. A long whitish hand could dimly seen shot grabbed gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes shone coldly peered inside, lifted gazed Frodo eyot. They yard two away, Frodo heard soft hiss intaken breath. He stood up, drawing Sting sheath, faced eyes. Immediately light shut off. There another hiss splash, dark log-shape shot away downstream night. Aragorn stirred sleep, turned over, sat up. ‘What it?’ whispered, springing coming Frodo. ‘I felt something sleep. Why drawn sword?’ ‘Gollum,’ answered Frodo. ‘Or least, I guess.’ ‘Ah!’ said Aragorn. ‘So know little footpad, you? He padded us Moria right Nimrodel. Since took boats, lying log paddling hands feet. I tried catch twice night; slier fox, slippery fish. I hoped river-voyage would beat him, clever waterman. ‘We shall try going faster tomorrow. You lie now, I keep watch left night. I wish I could lay hands wretch. We might make useful. But I cannot, shall try lose him. He dangerous. Quite apart murder night account, may put enemy track.’ The night passed without Gollum showing much shadow again. After Company kept sharp look-out, saw Gollum voyage lasted. If still following, wary cunning. At Aragorn’s bidding paddled long spells, banks went swiftly by. But saw little country, journeyed mostly night twilight, resting day, lying hidden land allowed. In way time passed without event seventh day. The weather still grey overcast, wind East, evening drew night sky away westward cleared, pools faint light, yellow pale green, opened grey shores cloud. There white rind new Moon could seen glimmering remote lakes. Sam looked puckered brows. The next day country either side began change rapidly. The banks began rise grow stony. Soon passing hilly rocky land, shores steep slopes buried deep brakes thorn sloe, tangled brambles creepers. Behind stood low crumbling cliffs, chimneys grey weathered stone dark ivy; beyond rose high ridges crowned wind-writhen firs. They drawing near grey hill-country Emyn Muil, southern march Wilderland. There many birds cliffs rockchimneys, day high air flocks birds circling, black pale sky. As lay camp day Aragorn watched flights doubtfully, wondering Gollum mischief news voyage moving wilderness. Later sun setting, Company stirring getting ready start again, descried dark spot fading light: great bird high far off, wheeling, flying slowly southwards. ‘What that, Legolas?’ asked, pointing northern sky. ‘Is it, I think, eagle?’ ‘Yes,’ said Legolas. ‘It eagle, hunting eagle. I wonder forebodes. It far mountains.’ ‘We start fully dark,’ said Aragorn. The eighth night journey came. It silent windless; grey east wind passed away. The thin crescent Moon fallen early pale sunset, sky clear above, though far away South great ranges cloud still shone faintly, West stars glinted bright. ‘Come!’ said Aragorn. ‘We venture one journey night. We coming reaches River I know well; I never journeyed water parts before, rapids Sarn Gebir. But I right reckoning, still many miles ahead. Still dangerous places even come there: rocks stony eyots stream. We must keep sharp watch try paddle swiftly.’ To Sam leading boat given task watchman. He lay forward peering gloom. The night grew dark, stars strangely bright, glimmer face River. It close midnight, drifting while, hardly using paddles, suddenly Sam cried out. Only yards ahead dark shapes loomed stream heard swirl racing water. There swift current swung left, towards eastern shore channel clear. As swept aside travellers could see, close, pale foam River lashing sharp rocks thrust far stream like ridge teeth. The boats huddled together. ‘Hoy there, Aragorn!’ shouted Boromir, boat bumped leader. ‘This madness! We cannot dare Rapids night! But boat live Sarn Gebir, night day.’ ‘Back, back!’ cried Aragorn. ‘Turn! Turn can!’ He drove paddle water, trying hold boat bring round. ‘I reckoning,’ said Frodo. ‘I know come far: Anduin flows faster I thought. Sarn Gebir must close hand already.’ With great efforts checked boats slowly brought about; first could make small headway current, time carried nearer nearer eastern bank. Now dark ominous loomed night. ‘All together, paddle!’ shouted Boromir. ‘Paddle! Or shall driven shoals.’ Even spoke Frodo felt keel beneath grate upon stone. At moment twang bowstrings: several arrows whistled them, fell among them. One smote Frodo shoulders lurched forward cry, letting go paddle: arrow fell back, foiled hidden coat mail. Another passed Aragorn’s hood; third stood fast gunwale second boat, close Merry’s hand. Sam thought could glimpse black figures running fro upon long shingle-banks lay eastern shore. They seemed near. ‘Yrch!’ said Legolas, falling tongue. ‘Orcs!’ cried Gimli. ‘Gollum’s doing, I’ll bound,’ said Sam Frodo. ‘And nice place choose, too. The River seems set taking us right arms!’ They leaned forward straining paddles: even Sam took hand. Every moment expected feel bite black-feathered arrows. Many whined overhead struck water nearby; hits. It dark, dark night-eyes Orcs, starglimmer must offered cunning foes mark, unless grey cloaks Lo´rien grey timber elf-wrought boats defeated malice archers Mordor. Stroke stroke laboured on. In darkness hard sure indeed moving all; slowly swirl water grew less, shadow eastern bank faded back night. At last, far could judge, reached middle stream driven boats back distance jutting rocks. Then half turning thrust strength towards western shore. Under shadow bushes leaning water halted drew breath. Legolas laid paddle took bow brought Lo´rien. Then sprang ashore climbed paces bank. Stringing bow fitting arrow turned, peering back River darkness. Across water shrill cries, nothing could seen. Frodo looked Elf standing tall him, gazed night, seeking mark shoot at. His head dark, crowned sharp white stars glittered black pools sky behind. But rising sailing South great clouds advanced, sending dark outriders starry fields. A sudden dread fell Company. ‘Elbereth Gilthoniel!’ sighed Legolas looked up. Even so, dark shape, like cloud yet cloud, moved far swiftly, came blackness South, sped towards Company, blotting light approached. Soon appeared great winged creature, blacker pits night. Fierce voices rose greet across water. Frodo felt sudden chill running clutching heart; deadly cold, like memory old wound, shoulder. He crouched down, hide. Suddenly great bow Lo´rien sang. Shrill went arrow elven-string. Frodo looked up. Almost winged shape swerved. There harsh croaking scream, fell air, vanishing gloom eastern shore. The sky clean again. There tumult many voices far away, cursing wailing darkness, silence. Neither shaft cry came east night. After Aragorn led boats back upstream. They felt way along water’s edge distance, found small shallow bay. A low trees grew close water, behind rose steep rocky bank. Here Company decided stay await dawn: useless attempt move night. They made camp lit fire, lay huddled boats, moored close together. ‘Praised bow Galadriel, hand eye Legolas!’ said Gimli, munched wafer lembas. ‘That mighty shot dark, friend!’ ‘But say hit?’ said Legolas. ‘I cannot,’ said Gimli. ‘But I glad shadow came nearer. I liked all. Too much reminded shadow Moria – shadow Balrog,’ ended whisper. ‘It Balrog,’ said Frodo, still shivering chill come upon him. ‘It something colder. I think was——’ Then paused fell silent. ‘What think?’ asked Boromir eagerly, leaning boat, trying catch glimpse Frodo’s face. ‘I think—No, I say,’ answered Frodo. ‘Whatever was, fall dismayed enemies.’ ‘So seems,’ said Aragorn. ‘Yet are, many, next, know. This night must sleepless! Dark hides us now. But day show tell? Have weapons close hand!’ Sam sat tapping hilt sword counting fingers, looking sky. ‘It’s strange,’ murmured. ‘The Moon’s Shire Wilderland, ought be. But either it’s running, I’m wrong reckoning. You’ll remember, Mr. Frodo, Moon waning lay flet tree: week full, I reckon. And we’d week way last night, pops New Moon thin nail-paring, never stayed time Elvish country. ‘Well, I remember three nights certain, I seem remember several more, I would take oath never whole month. Anyone would think time count there!’ ‘And perhaps way it,’ said Frodo. ‘In land, maybe, time elsewhere long gone by. It not, I think, Silverlode bore us back Anduin returned time flows mortal lands Great Sea. And I don’t remember moon, either new old, Caras Galadhon: stars night sun day.’ Legolas stirred boat. ‘Nay, time tarry ever,’ said; ‘but change growth things places alike. For Elves world moves, moves swift slow. Swift, change little, else fleets by: grief them. Slow, need count running years, themselves. The passing seasons ripples ever repeated long long stream. Yet beneath Sun things must wear end last.’ ‘But wearing slow Lo´rien,’ said Frodo. ‘The power Lady it. Rich hours, though short seem, Caras Galadhon, Galadriel wields Elvenring.’ ‘That said outside Lo´rien, even me,’ said Aragorn. ‘Speak it! But is, Sam: land lost count. There time flowed swiftly us, Elves. The old moon passed, new moon waxed waned world outside, tarried there. And yestereve new moon came again. Winter nearly gone. Time flows spring little hope.’ The night passed silently. No voice call heard across water. The travellers huddled boats felt changing weather. The air grew warm still great moist clouds floated South distant seas. The rushing River rocks rapids seemed grow louder closer. The twigs trees began drip. When day came mood world become soft sad. Slowly dawn grew pale light, diffused shadowless. There mist River, white fog swathed shore; far bank could seen. ‘I can’t abide fog,’ said Sam; ‘but seems lucky one. Now perhaps get away without cursed goblins seeing us.’ ‘Perhaps so,’ said Aragorn. ‘But hard find path unless fog lifts little later on. And must find path, pass Sarn Gebir come Emyn Muil.’ ‘I see pass Rapids follow River further,’ said Boromir. ‘If Emyn Muil lie us, abandon cockle-boats, strike westward southward, come Entwash cross land.’ ‘We can, making Minas Tirith,’ said Aragorn, ‘but yet agreed. And course may perilous sounds. The vale Entwash flat fenny, fog deadly peril foot laden. I would abandon boats must. The River least path cannot missed.’ ‘But Enemy holds eastern bank,’ objected Boromir. ‘And even pass Gates Argonath come unmolested Tindrock, then? Leap Falls land marshes?’ ‘No!’ answered Aragorn. ‘Say rather bear boats ancient way Rauros-foot, take water again. Do know, Boromir, choose forget North Stair, high seat upon Amon Hen, made days great kings? I least mind stand high place again, I decide course. There, maybe, shall see sign guide us.’ Boromir held long choice; became plain Frodo would follow Aragorn, wherever went, gave in. ‘It way Men Minas Tirith desert friends need,’ said, ‘and need strength, ever reach Tindrock. To tall isle I go, further. There I shall turn home, alone help earned reward companionship.’ The day growing, fog lifted little. It decided Aragorn Legolas go forward along shore, others remained boats. Aragorn hoped find way could carry boats baggage smoother water beyond Rapids. ‘Boats Elves would sink, maybe,’ said, ‘but say come Sarn Gebir alive. None ever done yet. No road made Men Gondor region, even great days realm reach Anduin beyond Emyn Muil; portage-way somewhere western shore, I find it. It cannot yet perished; light boats used journey Wilderland Osgiliath, still years ago, Orcs Mordor began multiply.’ ‘Seldom life boat come North, Orcs prowl east-shore,’ said Boromir. ‘If go forward, peril grow every mile, even find path.’ ‘Peril lies ahead every southward road,’ answered Aragorn. ‘Wait us one day. If return time, know evil indeed befallen us. Then must take new leader follow best can.’ It heavy heart Frodo saw Aragorn Legolas climb steep bank vanish mists; fears proved groundless. Only two three hours passed, barely mid-day, shadowy shapes explorers appeared again. ‘All well,’ said Aragorn, clambered bank. ‘There track, leads good landing still serviceable. The distance great: head Rapids half mile us, little mile long. Not far beyond stream becomes clear smooth again, though runs swiftly. Our hardest task get boats baggage old portage-way. We found it, lies well back water-side here, runs lee rock-wall, furlong shore. We find northward landing lies. If still remains, must passed yesterday night. We might labour far upstream yet miss fog. I fear must leave River now, make portageway best here.’ ‘That would easy, even Men,’ said Boromir. ‘Yet try it,’ said Aragorn. ‘Aye, will,’ said Gimli. ‘The legs Men lag rough road, Dwarf goes on, burden twice weight, Master Boromir!’ The task proved hard indeed, yet end done. The goods taken boats brought top bank, level space. Then boats drawn water carried up. They far less heavy expected. Of tree growing Elvish country made even Legolas knew; wood tough yet strangely light. Merry Pippin alone could carry boat ease along flat. Nonetheless needed strength two Men lift haul ground Company cross. It sloped away River, tumbled waste grey limestone-boulders, many hidden holes shrouded weeds bushes; thickets brambles, sheer dells; boggy pools fed waters trickling terraces inland. One one Boromir Aragorn carried boats, others toiled scrambled baggage. At last removed laid portage-way. Then little hindrance, save sprawling briars many fallen stones, moved forward together. Fog still hung veils upon crumbling rock-wall, left mist shrouded River: could hear rushing foaming sharp shelves stony teeth Sarn Gebir, could see it. Twice made journey, brought safe southern landing. There portage-way, turning back water-side, ran gently shallow edge little pool. It seemed scooped river-side, hand, water swirling Sarn Gebir low pier rock jutted way stream. Beyond shore rose sheer grey cliff, passage foot. Already short afternoon past, dim cloudy dusk closing in. They sat beside water listening confused rush roar Rapids hidden mist; tired sleepy, hearts gloomy dying day. ‘Well, are, must pass another night,’ said Boromir. ‘We need sleep, even Aragorn mind pass Gates Argonath night, tired – except, doubt, sturdy dwarf.’ Gimli made reply: nodding sat. ‘Let us rest much now,’ said Aragorn. ‘Tomorrow must journey day again. Unless weather changes cheats us, shall good chance slipping through, unseen eyes eastern shore. But tonight two must watch together turns: three hours one guard.’ Nothing happened night worse brief drizzle rain hour dawn. As soon fully light started. Already fog thinning. They kept close could western side, could see dim shapes low cliffs rising ever higher, shadowy walls feet hurrying river. In mid-morning clouds drew lower, began rain heavily. They drew skin-covers boats prevent flooded, drifted on; little could seen grey falling curtains. The rain, however, last long. Slowly sky grew lighter, suddenly clouds broke, draggled fringes trailed away northward River. The fogs mists gone. Before travellers lay wide ravine, great rocky sides clung, upon shelves narrow crevices, thrawn trees. The channel grew narrower River swifter. Now speeding along little hope stopping turning, whatever might meet ahead. Over lane pale-blue sky, around dark overshadowed River, black, shutting sun, hills Emyn Muil, opening could seen. Frodo peering forward saw distance two great rocks approaching: like great pinnacles pillars stone seemed. Tall sheer ominous stood upon either side stream. A narrow gap appeared them, River swept boats towards it. ‘Behold Argonath, Pillars Kings!’ cried Aragorn. ‘We shall pass soon. Keep boats line, far apart can! Hold middle stream!’ As Frodo borne towards great pillars rose like towers meet him. Giants seemed him, vast grey figures silent threatening. Then saw indeed shaped fashioned: craft power old wrought upon them, still preserved suns rains forgotten years mighty likenesses hewn. Upon great pedestals founded deep waters stood two great kings stone: still blurred eyes crannied brows frowned upon North. The left hand raised palm outwards gesture warning; right hand axe; upon head crumbling helm crown. Great power majesty still wore, silent wardens long-vanished kingdom. Awe fear fell upon Frodo, cowered down, shutting eyes daring look boat drew near. Even Boromir bowed head boats whirled by, frail fleeting little leaves, enduring shadow sentinels Nu´menor. So passed dark chasm Gates. Sheer rose dreadful cliffs unguessed heights either side. Far dim sky. The black waters roared echoed, wind screamed them. Frodo crouching knees heard Sam front muttering groaning: ‘What place! What horrible place! Just let get boat, I’ll never wet toes puddle again, let alone river!’ ‘Fear not!’ said strange voice behind him. Frodo turned saw Strider, yet Strider; weatherworn Ranger longer there. In stern sat Aragorn son Arathorn, proud erect, guiding boat skilful strokes; hood cast back, dark hair blowing wind, light eyes: king returning exile land. ‘Fear not!’ said. ‘Long I desired look upon likenesses Isildur Ana´rion, sires old. Under shadow Elessar, Elfstone son Arathorn House Valandil Isildur’s son, heir Elendil, naught dread!’ Then light eyes faded, spoke himself: ‘Would Gandalf here! How heart yearns Minas Anor walls city! But whither shall I go?’ The chasm long dark, filled noise wind rushing water echoing stone. It bent somewhat towards west first dark ahead; soon Frodo saw tall gap light him, ever growing. Swiftly drew near, suddenly boats shot through, wide clear light. The sun, already long fallen noon, shining windy sky. The pent waters spread long oval lake, pale Nen Hithoel, fenced steep grey hills whose sides clad trees, heads bare, cold-gleaming sunlight. At far southern end rose three peaks. The midmost stood somewhat forward others sundered them, island waters, flowing River flung pale shimmering arms. Distant deep came wind roaring sound like roll thunder heard far away. ‘Behold Tol Brandir!’ said Aragorn, pointing south tall peak. ‘Upon left stands Amon Lhaw, upon right Amon Hen, Hills Hearing Sight. In days great kings high seats upon them, watch kept there. But said foot man beast ever set upon Tol Brandir. Ere shade night falls shall come them. I hear endless voice Rauros calling.’ The Company rested while, drifting south current flowed middle lake. They ate food, took paddles hastened way. The sides westward hills fell shadow, Sun grew round red. Here misty star peered out. The three peaks loomed them, darkling twilight. Rauros roaring great voice. Already night laid flowing waters travellers came last shadow hills. The tenth day journey over. Wilderland behind them. They could go without choice east-way west. The last stage Quest them. Chapter 10 THE BREAKING OF THE FELLOWSHIP Aragorn led right arm River. Here upon western side shadow Tol Brandir green lawn ran water feet Amon Hen. Behind rose first gentle slopes hill clad trees, trees marched away westward along curving shores lake. A little spring fell tumbling fed grass. ‘Here rest tonight,’ said Aragorn. ‘This lawn Parth Galen: fair place summer days old. Let us hope evil yet come here.’ They drew boats green banks, beside made camp. They set watch, sight sound enemies. If Gollum contrived follow them, remained unseen unheard. Nonetheless night wore Aragorn grew uneasy, tossing often sleep waking. In small hours got came Frodo, whose turn watch. ‘Why waking?’ asked Frodo. ‘It watch.’ ‘I know,’ answered Aragorn; ‘but shadow threat growing sleep. It would well draw sword.’ ‘Why?’ said Frodo. ‘Are enemies hand?’ ‘Let us see Sting may show,’ answered Aragorn. Frodo drew elf-blade sheath. To dismay edges gleamed dimly night. ‘Orcs!’ said. ‘Not near, yet near, seems.’ ‘I feared much,’ said Aragorn. ‘But maybe side River. The light Sting faint, may point spies Mordor roaming slopes Amon Lhaw. I never heard Orcs upon Amon Hen. Yet knows may happen evil days, Minas Tirith longer holds secure passages Anduin. We must go warily tomorrow.’ The day came like fire smoke. Low East black bars cloud like fumes great burning. The rising sun lit beneath flames murky red; soon climbed clear sky. The summit Tol Brandir tipped gold. Frodo looked eastward gazed tall island. Its sides sprang sheer running water. High tall cliffs steep slopes upon trees climbed, mounting one head another; grey faces inaccessible rock, crowned great spire stone. Many birds circling it, sign living things could seen. When eaten, Aragorn called Company together. ‘The day come last,’ said: ‘the day choice long delayed. What shall become Company travelled far fellowship? Shall turn west Boromir go wars Gondor; turn east Fear Shadow; shall break fellowship go way may choose? Whatever must done soon. We cannot long halt here. The enemy eastern shore, know; I fear Orcs may already side water.’ There long silence one spoke moved. ‘Well, Frodo,’ said Aragorn last. ‘I fear burden laid upon you. You Bearer appointed Council. Your way alone choose. In matter I cannot advise you. I Gandalf, though I tried bear part, I know design hope hour, indeed any. Most likely seems choice would still wait you. Such fate.’ Frodo answer once. Then spoke slowly. ‘I know haste needed, yet I cannot choose. The burden heavy. Give hour longer, I speak. Let alone!’ Aragorn looked kindly pity. ‘Very well, Frodo son Drogo,’ said. ‘You shall hour, shall alone. We stay while. But stray far call.’ Frodo sat moment head bowed. Sam, watching master great concern, shook head muttered: ‘Plain pikestaff is, it’s good Sam Gamgee putting spoke now.’ Presently Frodo got walked away; Sam saw others restrained stare him, eyes Boromir followed Frodo intently, passed sight trees foot Amon Hen. Wandering aimlessly first wood, Frodo found feet leading towards slopes hill. He came path, dwindling ruins road long ago. In steep places stairs stone hewn, cracked worn, split roots trees. For climbed, caring way went, came grassy place. Rowan-trees grew it, midst wide flat stone. The little upland lawn open upon East filled early sunlight. Frodo halted looked River, far him, Tol Brandir birds wheeling great gulf air untrodden isle. The voice Rauros mighty roaring mingled deep throbbing boom. He sat upon stone cupped chin hands, staring eastwards seeing little eyes. All happened since Bilbo left Shire passing mind, recalled pondered everything could remember Gandalf’s words. Time went on, still nearer choice. Suddenly awoke thoughts: strange feeling came something behind him, unfriendly eyes upon him. He sprang turned; saw surprise Boromir, face smiling kind. ‘I afraid you, Frodo,’ said, coming forward. ‘If Aragorn right Orcs near, none us wander alone, least all: much depends you. And heart heavy. May I stay talk while, since I found you? It would comfort me. Where many, speech becomes debate without end. But two together may perhaps find wisdom.’ ‘You kind,’ answered Frodo. ‘But I think speech help me. For I know I do, I afraid it, Boromir: afraid.’ Boromir stood silent. Rauros roared endlessly on. The wind murmured branches trees. Frodo shivered. Suddenly Boromir came sat beside him. ‘Are sure suffer needlessly?’ said. ‘I wish help you. Youneedcounselinyourhardchoice.Willyounottakemine?’ ‘I think I know already counsel would give, Boromir,’ said Frodo. ‘And would seem like wisdom warning heart.’ ‘Warning? Warning what?’ said Boromir sharply. ‘Against delay. Against way seems easier. Against refusal burden laid me. Against – well, must said, trust strength truth Men.’ ‘Yet strength long protected far away little country, though knew not.’ ‘I doubt valour people. But world changing. The walls Minas Tirith may strong, strong enough. If fail, then?’ ‘We shall fall battle valiantly. Yet still hope fail.’ ‘No hope Ring lasts,’ said Frodo. ‘Ah! The Ring!’ said Boromir, eyes lighting. ‘The Ring! Is strange fate suffer much fear doubt small thing? So small thing! And I seen instant house Elrond. Could I sight again?’ Frodo looked up. His heart went suddenly cold. He caught strange gleam Boromir’s eyes, yet face still kind friendly. ‘It best lie hidden,’ answered. ‘As wish. I care not,’ said Boromir. ‘Yet may I even speak it? For seem ever think power hands Enemy: evil uses good. The world changing, say. Minas Tirith fall, Ring lasts. But why? Certainly, Ring Enemy. But why, us?’ ‘Were Council?’ answered Frodo. ‘Because cannot use it, done turns evil.’ Boromir got walked impatiently. ‘So go on,’ cried. ‘Gandalf, Elrond – folk taught say so. For may right. These elves half-elves wizards, would come grief perhaps. Yet often I doubt wise merely timid. But kind. True-hearted Men, corrupted. We Minas Tirith staunch long years trial. We desire power wizardlords, strength defend ourselves, strength cause. And behold! need chance brings light Ring Power. It gift, I say; gift foes Mordor. It mad use it, use power Enemy him. The fearless, ruthless, alone achieve victory. What could warrior hour, great leader? What could Aragorn do? Or refuses, Boromir? The Ring would give power Command. How I would drive hosts Mordor, men would flock banner!’ Boromir strode down, speaking ever loudly. Almost seemed forgotten Frodo, talk dwelt walls weapons, mustering men; drew plans great alliances glorious victories be; cast Mordor, became mighty king, benevolent wise. Suddenly stopped waved arms. ‘And tell us throw away!’ cried. ‘I say destroy it. That might well, reason could show hope so. It not. The plan proposed us halfling walk blindly Mordor offer Enemy every chance recapturing himself. Folly! ‘Surely see it, friend?’ said, turning suddenly Frodo again. ‘You say afraid. If so, boldest pardon you. But really good sense revolts?’ ‘No, I afraid,’ said Frodo. ‘Simply afraid. But I glad heard speak fully. My mind clearer now.’ ‘Then come Minas Tirith?’ cried Boromir. His eyes shining face eager. ‘You misunderstand me,’ said Frodo. ‘But come, least while?’ Boromir persisted. ‘My city far now; little Mordor here. We long wilderness, need news Enemy make move. Come me, Frodo,’ said. ‘You need rest venture, go must.’ He laid hand hobbit’s shoulder friendly fashion; Frodo felt hand trembling suppressed excitement. He stepped quickly away, eyed alarm tall Man, nearly twice height many times match strength. ‘Why unfriendly?’ said Boromir. ‘I true man, neither thief tracker. I need Ring: know now; I give word I desire keep it. Will least let make trial plan? Lend Ring!’ ‘No! no!’ cried Frodo. ‘The Council laid upon bear it.’ ‘It folly Enemy defeat us,’ cried Boromir. ‘How angers me! Fool! Obstinate fool! Running wilfully death ruining cause. If mortals claim Ring, men Nu´menor, Halflings. It save unhappy chance. It might mine. It mine. Give me!’ Frodo answer, moved away till great flat stone stood them. ‘Come, come, friend!’ said Boromir softer voice. ‘Why get rid it? Why free doubt fear? You lay blame me, will. You say I strong took force. For I strong you, halfling,’ cried; suddenly sprang stone leaped Frodo. His fair pleasant face hideously changed; raging fire eyes. Frodo dodged aside put stone them. There one thing could do: trembling pulled Ring upon chain quickly slipped finger, even Boromir sprang again. The Man gasped, stared moment amazed, ran wildly about, seeking among rocks trees. ‘Miserable trickster!’ shouted. ‘Let get hands you! Now I see mind. You take Ring Sauron sell us all. You waited chance leave us lurch. Curse halflings death darkness!’ Then, catching foot stone, fell sprawling lay upon face. For still curse struck down; suddenly wept. He rose passed hand eyes, dashing away tears. ‘What I said?’ cried. ‘What I done? Frodo, Frodo!’ called. ‘Come back! A madness took me, passed. Come back!’ There answer. Frodo even hear cries. He already far away, leaping blindly path hill-top. Terror grief shook him, seeing thought mad fierce face Boromir, burning eyes. Soon came alone summit Amon Hen, halted, gasping breath. He saw mist wide flat circle, paved mighty flags, surrounded crumbling battlement; middle, set upon four carven pillars, high seat, reached stair many steps. Up went sat upon ancient chair, feeling like lost child clambered upon throne mountainkings. At first could see little. He seemed world mist shadows: Ring upon him. Then mist gave way saw many visions: small clear eyes upon table, yet remote. There sound, bright living images. The world seemed shrunk fallen silent. He sitting upon Seat Seeing, Amon Hen, Hill Eye Men Nu´menor. Eastward looked wide uncharted lands, nameless plains, forests unexplored. Northward looked, Great River lay like ribbon beneath him, Misty Mountains stood small hard broken teeth. Westward looked saw broad pastures Rohan; Orthanc, pinnacle Isengard, like black spike. Southward looked, feet Great River curled like toppling wave plunged falls Rauros foaming pit; glimmering rainbow played upon fume. And Ethir Anduin saw, mighty delta River, myriads sea-birds whirling like white dust sun, beneath green silver sea, rippling endless lines. But everywhere looked saw signs war. The Misty Mountains crawling like anthills: orcs issuing thousand holes. Under boughs Mirkwood deadly strife Elves Men fell beasts. The land Beornings aflame; cloud Moria; smoke rose borders Lo´rien. Horsemen galloping grass Rohan; wolves poured Isengard. From havens Harad ships war put sea; East Men moving endlessly: swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon horses, chariots chieftains laden wains. All power Dark Lord motion. Then turning south beheld Minas Tirith. Faraway seemed, andbeautiful: white-walled, many-towered, proud fair upon mountain-seat; battlementsglitteredwithsteel,anditsturretswere bright many banners. Hope leaped heart. But Minas Tirith set another fortress, greater strong. Thither, eastward, unwilling eye drawn. It passed ruined bridges Osgiliath, grinning gates Minas Morgul, haunted Mountains, looked upon Gorgoroth, valley terror Land Mordor. Darkness lay Sun. Fire glowed amid smoke. Mount Doom burning, great reek rising. Then last gaze held: wall upon wall, battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain iron, gate steel, tower adamant, saw it: Barad-duˆr, Fortress Sauron. All hope left him. And suddenly felt Eye. There eye Dark Tower sleep. He knew become aware gaze. A fierce eager there. It leaped towards him; almost like finger felt it, searching him. Very soon would nail down, know exactly was. Amon Lhaw touched. It glanced upon Tol Brandir – threw seat, crouching, covering head grey hood. He heard crying out: Never, never! Or it: Verily I come, I come you? He could tell. Then flash point power came mind another thought: Take off! Take off! Fool, take off! Take Ring! The two powers strove him. For moment, perfectly balanced piercing points, writhed, tormented. Suddenly aware again, Frodo, neither Voice Eye: free choose, one remaining instant so. He took Ring finger. He kneeling clear sunlight high seat. A black shadow seemed pass like arm him; missed Amon Hen groped west, faded. Then sky clean blue birds sang every tree. Frodo rose feet. A great weariness him, firm heart lighter. He spoke aloud himself. ‘I I must,’ said. ‘This least plain: evil Ring already work even Company, Ring must leave harm. I go alone. Some I cannot trust, I trust dear me: poor old Sam, Merry Pippin. Strider, too: heart yearns Minas Tirith, needed there, Boromir fallen evil. I go alone. At once.’ He went quickly path came back lawn Boromir found him. Then halted, listening. He thought could hear cries calls woods near shore below. ‘They’ll hunting me,’ said. ‘I wonder long I away. Hours, I think.’ He hesitated. ‘What I do?’ muttered. ‘I must go I shall never go. I shan’t get chance again. I hate leaving them, like without explanation. But surely understand. Sam will. And else I do?’ Slowly drew Ring put more. He vanished passed hill, less rustle wind. The others remained long river-side. For time silent, moving restlessly about; sitting circle, talking. Every made efforts speak things, long road many adventures; questioned Aragorn concerning realm Gondor ancient history, remnants great works could still seen strange border-land Emyn Muil: stone kings seats Lhaw Hen, great Stair beside falls Rauros. But always thoughts words strayed back Frodo Ring. What would Frodo choose do? Why hesitating? ‘He debating course desperate, I think,’ said Aragorn. ‘And well may. It hopeless ever Company go east, since tracked Gollum, must fear secret journey already betrayed. But Minas Tirith nearer Fire destruction Burden. ‘We may remain make brave stand; Lord Denethor men cannot hope even Elrond said beyond power: either keep Burden secret, hold full might Enemy comes take it. Which way would us choose Frodo’s place? I know. Now indeed miss Gandalf most.’ ‘Grievous loss,’ said Legolas. ‘Yet must needs make minds without aid. Why cannot decide, help Frodo? Let us call back vote! I vote Minas Tirith.’ ‘And I,’ said Gimli. ‘We, course, sent help Bearer along road, go wished; none us oath command seek Mount Doom. Hard parting Lothlo´rien. Yet I come far, I say this: reached last choice, clear I cannot leave Frodo. I would choose Minas Tirith, not, I follow him.’ ‘And I go him,’ said Legolas. ‘It would faithless say farewell.’ ‘It would indeed betrayal, left him,’ said Aragorn. ‘But goes east, need go him; I think should. That venture desperate: much eight three two, one alone. If would let choose, I appoint three companions: Sam, could bear otherwise; Gimli; myself. Boromir return city, father people need him; others go, least Meriadoc Peregrin, Legolas willing leave us.’ ‘That won’t all!’ cried Merry. ‘We can’t leave Frodo! Pippin I always intended go wherever went, still do. But realize would mean. It seemed different far away, Shire Rivendell. It would mad cruel let Frodo go Mordor. Why can’t stop him?’ ‘We must stop him,’ said Pippin. ‘And worrying about, I sure. He knows shan’t agree going east. And doesn’t like ask anyone go him, poor old fellow. Imagine it: going Mordor alone!’ Pippin shuddered. ‘But dear silly old hobbit, ought know hasn’t got ask. He ought know can’t stop him, shan’t leave him.’ ‘Begging pardon,’ said Sam. ‘I don’t think understand master all. He isn’t hesitating way go. Of course not! What’s good Minas Tirith anyway? To him, I mean, begging pardon, Master Boromir,’ added, turned. It discovered Boromir, first sitting silent outside circle, longer there. ‘Now where’s got to?’ cried Sam, looking worried. ‘He’s bit queer lately, mind. But anyway he’s business. He’s home, always said; blame him. But Mr. Frodo, knows he’s got find Cracks Doom, can. But he’s afraid. Now it’s come point, he’s plain terrified. That’s trouble is. Of course he’s bit schooling, speak – – since left home, he’d terrified he’d fling Ring River bolt. But he’s still frightened start. And isn’t worrying us either: whether we’ll go along no. He knows mean to. That’s another thing that’s bothering him. If screws go, he’ll want go alone. Mark words! We’re going trouble comes back. For he’ll screw right, sure name’s Baggins.’ ‘I believe speak wisely us, Sam,’ said Aragorn. ‘And shall do, prove right?’ ‘Stop him! Don’t let go!’ cried Pippin. ‘I wonder?’ said Aragorn. ‘He Bearer, fate Burden him. I think part drive one way other. Nor I think succeed, tried. There powers work far stronger.’ ‘Well, I wish Frodo would ‘‘screw up’’ come back, let us get over,’ said Pippin. ‘This waiting horrible! Surely time up?’ ‘Yes,’ said Aragorn. ‘The hour long passed. The morning wearing away. We must call him.’ At moment Boromir reappeared. He came trees walked towards without speaking. His face looked grim sad. He paused counting present, sat aloof, eyes ground. ‘Where been, Boromir?’ asked Aragorn. ‘Have seen Frodo?’ Boromir hesitated second. ‘Yes, no,’ answered slowly. ‘Yes: I found way hill, I spoke him. I urged come Minas Tirith go east. I grew angry left me. He vanished. I never seen thing happen before, though I heard tales. He must put Ring on. I could find again. I thought would return you.’ ‘Is say?’ said Aragorn, looking hard kindly Boromir. ‘Yes,’ answered. ‘I say yet.’ ‘This bad!’ cried Sam, jumping up. ‘I don’t know Man to. Why Mr. Frodo put thing on? He didn’t ought have; has, goodness knows may happened!’ ‘But wouldn’t keep on,’ said Merry. ‘Not escaped unwelcome visitor, like Bilbo used to.’ ‘But go? Where he?’ cried Pippin. ‘He’s away ages now.’ ‘How long since saw Frodo last, Boromir?’ asked Aragorn. ‘Half hour, maybe,’ answered. ‘Or might hour. I wandered time since. I know! I know!’ He put head hands, sat bowed grief. ‘An hour since vanished!’ shouted Sam. ‘We must try find once. Come on!’ ‘Wait moment!’ cried Aragorn. ‘We must divide pairs, arrange – here, hold on! Wait!’ It good. They took notice him. Sam dashed first. Merry Pippin followed, already disappearing westward trees shore, shouting: Frodo! Frodo! clear, high, hobbit-voices. Legolas Gimli running. A sudden panic madness seemed fallen Company. ‘We shall scattered lost,’ groaned Aragorn. ‘Boromir!Ido know part played mischief, help now! Go two young hobbits, guard least, even cannot find Frodo. Come back spot, find him, traces him. I shall return soon.’ Aragorn sprang swiftly away went pursuit Sam. Just reached little lawn among rowans overtook him, toiling uphill, panting calling, Frodo! ‘Come me, Sam!’ said. ‘None us alone. There mischief about. I feel it. I going top, Seat Amon Hen, see may seen. And look! It heart guessed, Frodo went way. Follow me, keep eyes open!’ He sped path. Sam best, could keep Strider Ranger, soon fell behind. He gone far Aragorn sight ahead. Sam stopped puffed. Suddenly clapped hand head. ‘Whoa, Sam Gamgee!’ said aloud. ‘Your legs short, use head! Let see now! Boromir isn’t lying, that’s way; hasn’t told us everything. Something scared Mr. Frodo badly. He screwed point, sudden. He made mind last – go. Where to? Off East. Not without Sam? Yes, without even Sam. That’s hard, cruel hard.’ Sam passed hand eyes, brushing away tears. ‘Steady, Gamgee!’ said. ‘Think, can! He can’t fly across rivers, can’t jump waterfalls. He’s got gear.

Sam refused leave master. Pippin gone, came sat curled Frodo’s feet, last nodded closed eyes. Frodo remained long awake, talking Gildor. spoke many things, old new, Frodo questioned Gildor much happenings wide world outside Shire. tidings mostly sad ominous: gathering darkness, wars Men, flight Elves. last Frodo asked question nearest heart: ‘Tell me, Gildor, seen Bilbo left us?’ Gildor smiled. ‘Yes,’ answered. ‘Twice. said farewell us spot. saw again, far here.’ say Bilbo, Frodo fell silent. ‘You ask tell much concerns yourself, Frodo,’ said Gildor. ‘But already know little, read face thought behind questions. leaving Shire, yet doubt will find seek, accomplish intend, will return. so?’ ‘It is,’ said Frodo; ‘but thought going secret known Gandalf faithful Sam.’ looked Sam, snoring gently. ‘The secret will reach Enemy us,’ said Gildor. ‘The Enemy?’ said Frodo. ‘Then know leaving Shire?’ ‘I know reason Enemy pursuing you,’ answered Gildor; ‘but perceive – strange indeed though seems me. warn peril now behind you, upon either side.’ ‘You mean Riders? feared servants Enemy.

Fear nothing!FortonightyouareundertheroofofTomBombadil.’ hobbits looked wonder; looked smiled. ‘Fair lady Goldberry!’ said Frodo last, feeling heart moved joy understand. stood times stood enchanted fair elven-voices; spell now laid upon different: less keen lofty delight, deeper nearer mortal heart; marvellous yet strange. ‘Fair lady Goldberry!’ said again. ‘Now joy hidden songs heard made plain me. O slender willow-wand! O clearer clear water! O reed living pool! Fair River-daughter! O spring-time summer-time, spring after!

Goldberry laughed. ‘Welcome!’ said. ‘I heard folk Shire sweet-tongued. see Elf-friend; light eyes ring voice tells it. merry meeting!

Every now caught, among many derry dol merry dol ring ding dillo repeated words: Old Tom Bombadil merry fellow; Bright blue jacket is, boots yellow. ‘Fair lady!’ said Frodo while. ‘Tell me, asking seem foolish, Tom Bombadil?’ ‘He is,’ said Goldberry, staying swift movements smiling.

Come now, merry friends, Tom will refresh you! clean grimy hands, wash weary faces; cast muddy cloaks comb tangles!’ opened door, followed short passage round sharp turn. came low room sloping roof (a penthouse, seemed, built north end house). walls clean stone, mostly covered green hanging mats yellow curtains. floor flagged, strewn fresh green rushes. four deep mattresses, piled white blankets, laid floor along one side. opposite wall long bench laden wide earthenware basins, beside stood brown ewers filled water, cold, steaming hot. soft green slippers set ready beside bed. long, washed refreshed, hobbits seated table, two side, either end sat Goldberry Master. long merry meal. Though hobbits ate, famished hobbits eat, lack. drink drinking-bowls seemed clear cold water, yet went hearts wine set free voices. guests became suddenly aware singing merrily, easier natural talking. last Tom Goldberry rose cleared table swiftly. guests commanded sit quiet, set chairs, footstool tired feet. fire wide hearth them, burning sweet smell, built apple-wood. everything set order, lights room put out, except one lamp pair candles end chimney-shelf. Goldberry came stood them, holding candle; wished good night deep sleep. ‘Have peace now,’ said, ‘until morning! Heed nightly noises! nothing passes door window save moonlight starlight wind hill-top. Good night!’ passed room glimmer rustle. sound footsteps stream falling gently away downhill cool stones quiet night. Tom sat beside silence, tried muster courage ask one many questions meant ask supper. Sleep gathered eyelids. last Frodo spoke: ‘Did hear calling, Master, chance brought moment?’ Tom stirred man shaken pleasant dream. ‘Eh, what?’ said he. ‘Did hear calling? Nay, hear: busy singing. chance brought then, chance call it. plan mine, though waiting you. heard news you, learned wandering. guessed you’d come ere long water: paths lead way, Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he’s mighty singer; it’s hard little folk escape cunning mazes. Tom errand there, dared hinder.’ Tom nodded sleep taking again; went soft singing voice: errand there: gathering water-lilies, green leaves lilies white please pretty lady, last ere year’s end keep winter, flower pretty feet till snows melted. year summer’s end go find her, wide pool, deep clear, far Withywindle; open first spring linger latest. pool long ago found River-daughter, fair young Goldberry sitting rushes. Sweet singing then, heart beating! opened eyes looked sudden glint blue: proved well – now longer go deep along forest-water, year old. passing Old Man Willow’s house side spring-time, till merry spring, River-daughter dances withy-path bathe water. fell silent again; Frodo help asking one question: one desired answered. ‘Tell us, Master,’ said, ‘about Willow-man. he? never heard before.’ ‘No, don’t!’ said Merry Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright. ‘Not now! morning!’ ‘That right!’ said old man. ‘Now time resting. things ill hear world’s shadow. Sleep till morning-light, rest pillow! Heed nightly noise! Fear grey willow!’ took lamp blew out, grasping candle either hand led room. mattresses pillows soft down, blankets white wool. hardly laid deep beds drawn light covers asleep. dead night, Frodo lay dream without light. saw young moon rising; thin light loomed black wall rock, pierced dark arch great gate. seemed Frodo lifted up, passing saw rock-wall circle hills, within plain, midst plain stood pinnacle stone, vast tower made hands. top stood figure man. moon rose seemed hang moment head glistened white hair wind stirred it. dark plain came crying fell voices, howling many wolves. Suddenly shadow, shape great wings, passed across moon. figure lifted arms light flashed staff wielded. mighty eagle swept bore away. voices wailed wolves yammered. noise strong wind blowing, borne sound hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping East. ‘Black Riders!’ thought Frodo wakened, sound hoofs still echoing mind. wondered courage leave safety stone walls. lay motionless, still listening; now silent, last turned fell asleep wandered unremembered dream. side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; change came dreams turned groaned. Suddenly woke, thought waked, yet still heard darkness sound disturbed dream: tip-tap, squeak: noise branches fretting wind, twig-fingers scraping wall window: creak, creak, creak. wondered willow-trees close house; suddenly dreadful feeling ordinary house all, inside willow listening horrible dry creaking voice laughing again. sat up, felt soft pillows yield hands, lay relieved. seemed hear echo words ears: ‘Fear nothing! peace morning! Heed nightly noises!’ went sleep again. sound water Merry heard falling quiet sleep: water streaming gently, spreading, spreading irresistibly round house dark shoreless pool. gurgled walls, rising slowly surely. ‘I drowned!’ thought. ‘It will find way in, drown.’ felt lying soft slimy bog, springing set foot corner cold hard flagstone. remembered lay again. seemed hear remember hearing: ‘Nothing passes doors windows save moonlight starlight wind hill-top.’ little breath sweet air moved curtain. breathed deep fell asleep again. far remember, Sam slept night deep content, logs contented. woke up, four once, morning light. Tom moving room whistling starling. heard stir clapped hands, cried: ‘Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! hearties!’ drew back yellow curtains, hobbits saw covered windows, either end room, one looking east looking west. leapt refreshed. Frodo ran eastern window, found looking kitchen-garden grey dew. half expected see turf right walls, turf pocked hoof-prints. Actually view screened tall line beans poles; far beyond grey top hill loomed sunrise. pale morning: East, behind long clouds lines soiled wool stained red edges, lay glimmering deeps yellow. sky spoke rain come; light broadening quickly, red flowers beans began glow wet green leaves. Pippin looked western window, pool mist. Forest hidden fog. looking sloping cloud-roof above. fold channel mist broken many plumes billows: valley Withywindle. stream ran hill left vanished white shadows. Near hand flower-garden clipped hedge silver-netted, beyond grey shaven grass pale dew-drops. willow-tree seen. ‘Good morning, merry friends!’ cried Tom, opening eastern window wide. cool air flowed in; rainy smell. ‘Sun won’t show face much today, I’m thinking. walking wide, leaping hill-tops, grey dawn began, nosing wind weather, wet grass underfoot, wet sky me. wakened Goldberry singing window; naught wakes hobbit-folk early morning. night little folk wake darkness, sleep light come! Ring ding dillo! Wake now, merry friends! Forget nightly noises! Ring ding dillo del! derry del, hearties! come soon you’ll find breakfast table. come late you’ll grass rain-water!’ Needless say – Tom’s threat sounded serious – hobbits came soon, left table late beginning look rather empty. Neither Tom Goldberry there. Tom heard house, clattering kitchen, stairs, singing outside. room looked westward mist-clouded valley, window open. Water dripped thatched eaves above. finished breakfast clouds joined unbroken roof, straight grey rain came softly steadily down. Behind deep curtain Forest completely veiled. looked window came falling gently flowing rain sky, clear voice Goldberry singing them. hear words, seemed plain song rain-song, sweet showers dry hills, told tale river spring highlands Sea far below. hobbits listened delight; Frodo glad heart, blessed kindly weather, delayed departing. thought going heavy upon moment awoke; guessed now go day. upper wind settled West deeper wetter clouds rolled spill laden rain bare heads Downs. Nothing seen round house falling water. Frodo stood near open door watched white chalky path turn little river milk go bubbling away valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round corner house, waving arms warding rain – indeed sprang threshold seemed quite dry, except boots. took put chimney-corner. sat largest chair called hobbits gather round him. ‘This Goldberry’s washing day,’ said, ‘and autumn-cleaning. wet hobbit-folk – let rest able! It’s good day long tales, questions answers, Tom will start talking.’ told many remarkable stories, sometimes half speaking himself, sometimes looking suddenly bright blue eye deep brows. Often voice turn song, chair dance about. told tales bees flowers, ways trees, strange creatures Forest, evil things good things, things friendly things unfriendly, cruel things kind things, secrets hidden brambles. listened, began understand lives Forest, apart themselves, indeed feel strangers things home. Moving constantly talk Old Man Willow, Frodo learned now enough content him, indeed enough, comfortable lore. Tom’s words laid bare hearts trees thoughts, often dark strange, filled hatred things go free upon earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers usurpers. called Old Forest without reason, indeed ancient, survivor vast forgotten woods; lived yet, ageing quicker hills, fathers fathers trees, remembering times lords. countless years filled pride rooted wisdom, malice. none dangerous Great Willow: heart rotten, strength green; cunning, master winds, song thought ran woods sides river. grey thirsty spirit drew power earth spread fine root-threads ground, invisible twig-fingers air, till dominion nearly trees Forest Hedge Downs. Suddenly Tom’s talk left woods went leaping young stream, bubbling waterfalls, pebbles worn rocks, among small flowers close grass wet crannies, wandering last Downs. heard Great Barrows, green mounds, stonerings upon hills hollows among hills. Sheep bleating flocks. Green walls white walls rose. fortresses heights. Kings little kingdoms fought together, young Sun shone fire red metal new greedy swords. victory defeat; towers fell, fortresses burned, flames went sky. Gold piled biers dead kings queens; mounds covered them, stone doors shut; grass grew all. Sheep walked biting grass, soon hills empty again. shadow came dark places far away, bones stirred mounds. Barrow-wights walked hollow places clink rings cold fingers, gold chains wind. Stone rings grinned ground broken teeth moonlight. hobbits shuddered. Even Shire rumour Barrow-wights Barrow-downs beyond Forest heard. tale hobbit liked listen to, even comfortable fireside far away. four now suddenly remembered joy house driven minds: house Tom Bombadil nestled shoulder dreaded hills. lost thread tale shifted uneasily, looking aside one another. caught words found now wandered strange regions beyond memory beyond waking thought, times world wider, seas flowed straight western Shore; still back Tom went singing ancient starlight, Elf-sires awake. suddenly stopped, saw nodded falling asleep. hobbits sat still him, enchanted; seemed if, spell words, wind gone, clouds dried up, day withdrawn, darkness come East West, sky filled light white stars. Whether morning evening one day many days passed Frodo tell. feel either hungry tired, filled wonder. stars shone window silence heavens seemed round him. spoke last wonder sudden fear silence: ‘Who you, Master?’ asked. ‘Eh, what?’ said Tom sitting up, eyes glinting gloom. ‘Don’t know name yet? That’s answer. Tell me, you, alone, nameless? young old. Eldest, that’s am. Mark words, friends: Tom river trees; Tom remembers first raindrop first acorn. made paths Big People, saw little People arriving. Kings graves Barrow-wights. Elves passed westward, Tom already, seas bent. knew dark stars fearless – Dark Lord came Outside.’ shadow seemed pass window, hobbits glanced hastily panes. turned again, Goldberry stood door behind, framed light. held candle, shielding flame draught hand; light flowed it, sunlight white shell. ‘The rain ended,’ said; ‘and new waters running downhill, stars. Let us now laugh glad!’ ‘And let us food drink!’ cried Tom. ‘Long tales thirsty. long listening’s hungry work, morning, noon, evening!’ jumped chair, bound took candle chimney-shelf lit flame Goldberry held; danced table. Suddenly hopped door disappeared. Quickly returned, bearing large laden tray. Tom Goldberry set table; hobbits sat half wonder half laughter: fair grace Goldberry merry odd caperings Tom. Yet fashion seemed weave single dance, neither hindering other, room, round table; great speed food vessels lights set order. boards blazed candles, white yellow. Tom bowed guests. ‘Supper ready,’ said Goldberry; now hobbits saw clothed silver white girdle, shoes fishes’ mail. Tom clean blue, blue rain-washed forget-me-nots, green stockings. supper even better before. hobbits spell Tom’s words may missed one meal many, food seemed least week eaten. sing even speak much while, paid close attention business. time hearts spirits rose high again, voices rang mirth laughter. eaten, Goldberry sang many songs them, songs began merrily hills fell softly silence; silences saw minds pools waters wider known, looking saw sky stars jewels depths. wished good night left fireside. Tom now seemed wide awake plied questions. appeared already know much families, indeed know much history doings Shire days hardly remembered among hobbits themselves. longer surprised them; made secret owed recent knowledge largely Farmer Maggot, seemed regard person importance imagined. ‘There’s earth old feet, clay fingers; wisdom bones, eyes open,’ said Tom. clear Tom dealings Elves, seemed fashion, news reached Gildor concerning flight Frodo. Indeed much Tom know, cunning questioning, Frodo found telling Bilbo hopes fears told even Gandalf. Tom wagged head down, glint eyes heard Riders. ‘Show precious Ring!’ said suddenly midst story: Frodo, astonishment, drew chain pocket, unfastening Ring handed Tom. seemed grow larger lay moment big brown-skinned hand. suddenly put eye laughed. second hobbits vision, comical alarming, bright blue eye gleaming circle gold. Tom put Ring round end little finger held candlelight. moment hobbits noticed nothing strange this. gasped. sign Tom disappearing! Tom laughed again, spun Ring air – vanished flash. Frodo gave cry – Tom leaned forward handed back smile. Frodo looked closely, rather suspiciously (like one lent trinket juggler). Ring, looked weighed same: Ring always seemed Frodo weigh strangely heavy hand. something prompted make sure. perhaps trifle annoyed Tom seeming make light even Gandalf thought perilously important. waited opportunity, talk going again, Tom telling absurd story badgers queer ways – slipped Ring on. Merry turned towards say something gave start, checked exclamation. Frodo delighted (in way): ring right, Merry staring blankly chair, obviously see him. got crept quietly away fireside towards outer door. ‘Hey there!’ cried Tom, glancing towards seeing look shining eyes. ‘Hey! Come Frodo, there! a-going? Old Tom Bombadil’s blind yet. Take golden ring! hand’s fair without it. Come back! Leave game sit beside me! must talk more, think morning. Tom must teach right road, keep feet wandering.’ Frodo laughed (trying feel pleased), taking Ring came sat again. Tom now told reckoned Sun shine tomorrow, glad morning, setting hopeful. well start early; weather country thing even Tom sure long, change sometimes quicker change jacket. ‘I weather-master,’ said he; ‘nor aught goes two legs.’ advice decided make nearly due North house, western lower slopes Downs: might hope way strike East Road day’s journey, avoid Barrows. told afraid – mind business. ‘Keep green grass. Don’t go a-meddling old stone cold Wights prying houses, unless strong folk hearts never falter!’ said once; advised pass barrows west-side, chanced stray near one. taught rhyme sing, ill-luck fall danger difficulty next day. Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! water, wood hill, reed willow, fire, sun moon, harken now hear us! Come, Tom Bombadil, need near us! sung altogether him, clapped shoulder laugh, taking candles led back bedroom. Chapter 8 FOG BARROW-DOWNS night heard noises. either dreams them, tell which, Frodo heard sweet singing running mind: song seemed come pale light behind grey rain-curtain, growing stronger turn veil glass silver, last rolled back, far green country opened swift sunrise. vision melted waking; Tom whistling tree-full birds; sun already slanting hill open window. Outside everything green pale gold. breakfast, ate alone, made ready say farewell, nearly heavy heart possible morning: cool, bright, clean washed autumn sky thin blue. air came fresh Northwest. quiet ponies almost frisky, sniffing moving restlessly. Tom came house waved hat danced upon doorstep, bidding hobbits go good speed. rode along path wound away behind house, went slanting towards north end hill-brow sheltered. dismounted lead ponies last steep slope, suddenly Frodo stopped. ‘Goldberry!’ cried. ‘My fair lady, clad silver green! never said farewell her, seen evening!’ distressed turned back; moment clear call came rippling down. hill-brow stood beckoning them: hair flying loose, caught sun shone shimmered. light glint water dewy grass flashed feet danced. hastened last slope, stood breathless beside her. bowed, wave arm bade look round; looked hill-top lands morning. now clear far-seen veiled misty stood upon knoll Forest, now seen rising pale green dark trees West. direction land rose wooded ridges, green, yellow, russet sun, beyond lay hidden valley Brandywine. South, line Withywindle, distant glint pale glass Brandywine River made great loop lowlands flowed away knowledge hobbits. Northward beyond dwindling downs land ran away flats swellings grey green pale earth-colours, faded featureless shadowy distance. Eastward Barrow-downs rose, ridge behind ridge morning, vanished eyesight guess: guess blue remote white glimmer blending hem sky, spoke them, memory old tales, high distant mountains. took deep draught air, felt skip stout strides bear wherever wished. seemed fainthearted go jogging aside crumpled skirts downs towards Road, leaping, lusty Tom, stepping stones hills straight towards Mountains. Goldberry spoke recalled eyes thoughts. ‘Speed now, fair guests!’ said. ‘And hold purpose! North wind left eye blessing footsteps! Make haste Sun shines!’ Frodo said: ‘Farewell, Elf-friend, merry meeting!’ Frodo found words answer. bowed low, mounted pony, followed friends jogged slowly gentle slope behind hill. Tom Bombadil’s house valley, Forest lost view. air grew warmer green walls hillside hillside, scent turf rose strong sweet breathed. Turning back, reached bottom green hollow, saw Goldberry, now small slender sunlit flower sky: standing still watching them, hands stretched towards them. looked gave clear call, lifting hand turned vanished behind hill. way wound along floor hollow, round green feet steep hill another deeper broader valley, shoulders hills, long limbs, smooth sides again, new hill-tops new valleys. tree visible water: country grass short springy turf, silent except whisper air edges land, high lonely cries strange birds. journeyed sun mounted, grew hot. time climbed ridge breeze seemed grown less. caught glimpse country westward distant Forest seemed smoking, fallen rain steaming leaf root mould. shadow now lay round edge sight, dark haze upper sky blue cap, hot heavy. mid-day came hill whose top wide flattened, shallow saucer green mounded rim.

Suddenly something caught sight: first stared listlessly, sat rubbed eyes; looked see more. night camped small eyot close western bank. Sam lay rolled blankets beside Frodo. ‘I funny dream hour two stopped, Mr. Frodo,’ said. ‘Or maybe wasn’t dream. Funny anyway.’ ‘Well, it?’ said Frodo, knowing Sam settle told tale, whatever was. ‘I haven’t seen thought anything make smile left Lothlo´rien.’ ‘It wasn’t funny way, Mr. Frodo. queer. wrong, wasn’t dream. best hear it. this: saw log eyes!’ ‘The log’s right,’ said Frodo. ‘There many River. leave eyes!’ ‘That won’t,’ said Sam. ‘’Twas eyes made sit up, speak. saw took log floating along half-light behind Gimli’s boat; didn’t give much heed it. seemed log slowly catching us up. peculiar, might say, seeing floating stream together. saw eyes: two pale sort points, shiny-like, hump near end log.

There’s nothing tell, much. thought heard soft plashing sniffing noise, back; hear lot queer sounds river night.’ lay down, Frodo sat up, huddled blankets, fought sleep. Minutes hours passed slowly, nothing happened. Frodo yielding temptation lie dark shape, hardly visible, floated close one moored boats. long whitish hand dimly seen shot grabbed gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes shone coldly peered inside, lifted gazed Frodo eyot. yard two away, Frodo heard soft hiss intaken breath. stood up, drawing Sting sheath, faced eyes. Immediately light shut off. another hiss splash, dark log-shape shot away downstream night. Aragorn stirred sleep, turned over, sat up. ‘What it?’ whispered, springing coming Frodo. ‘I felt something sleep. drawn sword?’ ‘Gollum,’ answered Frodo. ‘Or least, guess.’ ‘Ah!’ said Aragorn. ‘So know little footpad, you? padded us Moria right Nimrodel. took boats, lying log paddling hands feet. tried catch twice night; slier fox, slippery fish. hoped river-voyage beat him, clever waterman. ‘We try going faster tomorrow. lie now, will keep watch left night. wish lay hands wretch. might make useful. cannot, try lose him. dangerous. Quite apart murder night account, may put enemy track.’ night passed without Gollum showing much shadow again. Company kept sharp look-out, saw Gollum voyage lasted. still following, wary cunning. Aragorn’s bidding paddled now long spells, banks went swiftly by. saw little country, journeyed mostly night twilight, resting day, lying hidden land allowed. way time passed without event seventh day. weather still grey overcast, wind East, evening drew night sky away westward cleared, pools faint light, yellow pale green, opened grey shores cloud. white rind new Moon seen glimmering remote lakes. Sam looked puckered brows. next day country either side began change rapidly. banks began rise grow stony. Soon passing hilly rocky land, shores steep slopes buried deep brakes thorn sloe, tangled brambles creepers. Behind stood low crumbling cliffs, chimneys grey weathered stone dark ivy; beyond rose high ridges crowned wind-writhen firs. drawing near grey hill-country Emyn Muil, southern march Wilderland. many birds cliffs rockchimneys, day high air flocks birds circling, black pale sky. lay camp day Aragorn watched flights doubtfully, wondering Gollum mischief news voyage now moving wilderness. Later sun setting, Company stirring getting ready start again, descried dark spot fading light: great bird high far off, now wheeling, now flying slowly southwards. ‘What that, Legolas?’ asked, pointing northern sky. ‘Is it, think, eagle?’ ‘Yes,’ said Legolas. ‘It eagle, hunting eagle. wonder forebodes. far mountains.’ ‘We will start fully dark,’ said Aragorn. eighth night journey came. silent windless; grey east wind passed away. thin crescent Moon fallen early pale sunset, sky clear above, though far away South great ranges cloud still shone faintly, West stars glinted bright. ‘Come!’ said Aragorn. ‘We will venture one journey night. coming reaches River know well; never journeyed water parts before, rapids Sarn Gebir. right reckoning, still many miles ahead. Still dangerous places even come there: rocks stony eyots stream. must keep sharp watch try paddle swiftly.’ Sam leading boat given task watchman. lay forward peering gloom. night grew dark, stars strangely bright, glimmer face River. close midnight, drifting while, hardly using paddles, suddenly Sam cried out. yards ahead dark shapes loomed stream heard swirl racing water. swift current swung left, towards eastern shore channel clear. swept aside travellers see, now close, pale foam River lashing sharp rocks thrust far stream ridge teeth. boats huddled together. ‘Hoy there, Aragorn!’ shouted Boromir, boat bumped leader. ‘This madness! dare Rapids night! boat live Sarn Gebir, night day.’ ‘Back, back!’ cried Aragorn. ‘Turn!

Sarn Gebir must close hand already.’ great efforts checked boats slowly brought about; first make small headway current, time carried nearer nearer eastern bank. Now dark ominous loomed night. ‘All together, paddle!’ shouted Boromir. ‘Paddle! driven shoals.’ Even spoke Frodo felt keel beneath grate upon stone. moment twang bowstrings: several arrows whistled them, fell among them. One smote Frodo shoulders lurched forward cry, letting go paddle: arrow fell back, foiled hidden coat mail. Another passed Aragorn’s hood; third stood fast gunwale second boat, close Merry’s hand. Sam thought glimpse black figures running fro upon long shingle-banks lay eastern shore. seemed near. ‘Yrch!’ said Legolas, falling tongue. ‘Orcs!’ cried Gimli. ‘Gollum’s doing, I’ll bound,’ said Sam Frodo. ‘And nice place choose, too.

Legolas laid paddle took bow brought Lo´rien. sprang ashore climbed paces bank. Stringing bow fitting arrow turned, peering back River darkness. Across water shrill cries, nothing seen. Frodo looked Elf standing tall him, gazed night, seeking mark shoot at. head dark, crowned sharp white stars glittered black pools sky behind. now rising sailing South great clouds advanced, sending dark outriders starry fields. sudden dread fell Company. ‘Elbereth Gilthoniel!’ sighed Legolas looked up. Even so, dark shape, cloud yet cloud, moved far swiftly, came blackness South, sped towards Company, blotting light approached. Soon appeared great winged creature, blacker pits night. Fierce voices rose greet across water. Frodo felt sudden chill running clutching heart; deadly cold, memory old wound, shoulder. crouched down, hide. Suddenly great bow Lo´rien sang. Shrill went arrow elven-string. Frodo looked up. Almost winged shape swerved. harsh croaking scream, fell air, vanishing gloom eastern shore. sky clean again. tumult many voices far away, cursing wailing darkness, silence. Neither shaft cry came east night. Aragorn led boats back upstream. felt way along water’s edge distance, found small shallow bay. low trees grew close water, behind rose steep rocky bank. Company decided stay await dawn: useless attempt move night. made camp lit fire, lay huddled boats, moored close together. ‘Praised bow Galadriel, hand eye Legolas!’ said Gimli, munched wafer lembas. ‘That mighty shot dark, friend!’ ‘But say hit?’ said Legolas. ‘I cannot,’ said Gimli. ‘But glad shadow came nearer. liked all. much reminded shadow Moria – shadow Balrog,’ ended whisper. ‘It Balrog,’ said Frodo, still shivering chill come upon him. ‘It something colder. think was——’ paused fell silent. ‘What think?’ asked Boromir eagerly, leaning boat, trying catch glimpse Frodo’s face. ‘I think—No, will say,’ answered Frodo. ‘Whatever was, fall dismayed enemies.’ ‘So seems,’ said Aragorn. ‘Yet are, many, will next, know. night must sleepless! Dark hides us now. day will show tell? weapons close hand!’ Sam sat tapping hilt sword counting fingers, looking sky. ‘It’s strange,’ murmured. ‘The Moon’s Shire Wilderland, be. either it’s running, I’m wrong reckoning.

Yet beneath Sun things must wear end last.’ ‘But wearing slow Lo´rien,’ said Frodo. ‘The power Lady it. Rich hours, though short seem, Caras Galadhon, Galadriel wields Elvenring.’ ‘That said outside Lo´rien, even me,’ said Aragorn. ‘Speak it! is, Sam: land lost count. time flowed swiftly us, Elves. old moon passed, new moon waxed waned world outside, tarried there. yestereve new moon came again. Winter nearly gone.

Slowly dawn grew pale light, diffused shadowless. mist River, white fog swathed shore; far bank seen. ‘I can’t abide fog,’ said Sam; ‘but seems lucky one. Now perhaps away without cursed goblins seeing us.’ ‘Perhaps so,’ said Aragorn. ‘But will hard find path unless fog lifts little later on. must find path, pass Sarn Gebir come Emyn Muil.’ ‘I see pass Rapids follow River further,’ said Boromir. ‘If Emyn Muil lie us, abandon cockle-boats, strike westward southward, come Entwash cross land.’ ‘We can, making Minas Tirith,’ said Aragorn, ‘but yet agreed. course may perilous sounds. vale Entwash flat fenny, fog deadly peril foot laden. abandon boats must. River least path missed.’ ‘But Enemy holds eastern bank,’ objected Boromir. ‘And even pass Gates Argonath come unmolested Tindrock, will then? Leap Falls land marshes?’ ‘No!’ answered Aragorn. ‘Say rather will bear boats ancient way Rauros-foot, take water again. know, Boromir, choose forget North Stair, high seat upon Amon Hen, made days great kings? least mind stand high place again, decide course. There, maybe, see sign will guide us.’ Boromir held long choice; became plain Frodo follow Aragorn, wherever went, gave in. ‘It way Men Minas Tirith desert friends need,’ said, ‘and will need strength, reach Tindrock. tall isle will go, further. turn home, alone help earned reward companionship.’ day now growing, fog lifted little. decided Aragorn Legolas go forward along shore, others remained boats. Aragorn hoped find way carry boats baggage smoother water beyond Rapids. ‘Boats Elves sink, maybe,’ said, ‘but say come Sarn Gebir alive. None done yet. road made Men Gondor region, even great days realm reach Anduin beyond Emyn Muil; portage-way somewhere western shore, find it. yet perished; light boats used journey Wilderland Osgiliath, still years ago, Orcs Mordor began multiply.’ ‘Seldom life boat come North, Orcs prowl east-shore,’ said Boromir. ‘If go forward, peril will grow every mile, even find path.’ ‘Peril lies ahead every southward road,’ answered Aragorn. ‘Wait us one day. return time, will know evil indeed befallen us. must take new leader follow best can.’ heavy heart Frodo saw Aragorn Legolas climb steep bank vanish mists; fears proved groundless. two three hours passed, barely mid-day, shadowy shapes explorers appeared again. ‘All well,’ said Aragorn, clambered bank. ‘There track, leads good landing still serviceable. distance great: head Rapids half mile us, little mile long. far beyond stream becomes clear smooth again, though runs swiftly. hardest task will boats baggage old portage-way. found it, lies well back water-side here, runs lee rock-wall, furlong shore. find northward landing lies. still remains, must passed yesterday night. might labour far upstream yet miss fog. fear must leave River now, make portageway best here.’ ‘That easy, even Men,’ said Boromir. ‘Yet will try it,’ said Aragorn. ‘Aye, will,’ said Gimli. ‘The legs Men will lag rough road, Dwarf goes on, burden twice weight, Master Boromir!’ task proved hard indeed, yet end done. goods taken boats brought top bank, level space. boats drawn water carried up. far less heavy expected. tree growing Elvish country made even Legolas knew; wood tough yet strangely light. Merry Pippin alone carry boat ease along flat. Nonetheless needed strength two Men lift haul ground Company now cross. sloped away River, tumbled waste grey limestone-boulders, many hidden holes shrouded weeds bushes; thickets brambles, sheer dells; boggy pools fed waters trickling terraces inland. One one Boromir Aragorn carried boats, others toiled scrambled baggage. last removed laid portage-way. little hindrance, save sprawling briars many fallen stones, moved forward together. Fog still hung veils upon crumbling rock-wall, left mist shrouded River: hear rushing foaming sharp shelves stony teeth Sarn Gebir, see it. Twice made journey, brought safe southern landing. portage-way, turning back water-side, ran gently shallow edge little pool. seemed scooped river-side, hand, water swirling Sarn Gebir low pier rock jutted way stream. Beyond shore rose sheer grey cliff, passage foot. Already short afternoon past, dim cloudy dusk closing in. sat beside water listening confused rush roar Rapids hidden mist; tired sleepy, hearts gloomy dying day. ‘Well, are, must pass another night,’ said Boromir. ‘We need sleep, even Aragorn mind pass Gates Argonath night, tired – except, doubt, sturdy dwarf.’ Gimli made reply: nodding sat. ‘Let us rest much now,’ said Aragorn. ‘Tomorrow must journey day again. Unless weather changes cheats us, good chance slipping through, unseen eyes eastern shore. tonight two must watch together turns: three hours one guard.’ Nothing happened night worse brief drizzle rain hour dawn. soon fully light started. Already fog thinning. kept close western side, see dim shapes low cliffs rising higher, shadowy walls feet hurrying river. mid-morning clouds drew lower, began rain heavily. drew skin-covers boats prevent flooded, drifted on; little seen grey falling curtains. rain, however, last long. Slowly sky grew lighter, suddenly clouds broke, draggled fringes trailed away northward River. fogs mists gone. travellers lay wide ravine, great rocky sides clung, upon shelves narrow crevices, thrawn trees. channel grew narrower River swifter. Now speeding along little hope stopping turning, whatever might meet ahead. lane pale-blue sky, around dark overshadowed River, black, shutting sun, hills Emyn Muil, opening seen. Frodo peering forward saw distance two great rocks approaching: great pinnacles pillars stone seemed. Tall sheer ominous stood upon either side stream. narrow gap appeared them, River swept boats towards it. ‘Behold Argonath, Pillars Kings!’ cried Aragorn. ‘We pass soon. Keep boats line, far apart can! Hold middle stream!’ Frodo borne towards great pillars rose towers meet him. Giants seemed him, vast grey figures silent threatening. saw indeed shaped fashioned: craft power old wrought upon them, still preserved suns rains forgotten years mighty likenesses hewn. Upon great pedestals founded deep waters stood two great kings stone: still blurred eyes crannied brows frowned upon North. left hand raised palm outwards gesture warning; right hand axe; upon head crumbling helm crown. Great power majesty still wore, silent wardens long-vanished kingdom. Awe fear fell upon Frodo, cowered down, shutting eyes daring look boat drew near. Even Boromir bowed head boats whirled by, frail fleeting little leaves, enduring shadow sentinels Nu´menor. passed dark chasm Gates. Sheer rose dreadful cliffs unguessed heights either side. Far dim sky. black waters roared echoed, wind screamed them. Frodo crouching knees heard Sam front muttering groaning: ‘What place! horrible place! let boat, I’ll never wet toes puddle again, let alone river!’ ‘Fear not!’ said strange voice behind him. Frodo turned saw Strider, yet Strider; weatherworn Ranger longer there. stern sat Aragorn son Arathorn, proud erect, guiding boat skilful strokes; hood cast back, dark hair blowing wind, light eyes: king returning exile land. ‘Fear not!’ said. ‘Long desired look upon likenesses Isildur Ana´rion, sires old. shadow Elessar, Elfstone son Arathorn House Valandil Isildur’s son, heir Elendil, naught dread!’ light eyes faded, spoke himself: ‘Would Gandalf here! heart yearns Minas Anor walls city! whither now go?’ chasm long dark, filled noise wind rushing water echoing stone. bent somewhat towards west first dark ahead; soon Frodo saw tall gap light him, growing. Swiftly drew near, suddenly boats shot through, wide clear light. sun, already long fallen noon, shining windy sky. pent waters spread long oval lake, pale Nen Hithoel, fenced steep grey hills whose sides clad trees, heads bare, cold-gleaming sunlight. far southern end rose three peaks. midmost stood somewhat forward others sundered them, island waters, flowing River flung pale shimmering arms.

Nonetheless night wore Aragorn grew uneasy, tossing often sleep waking. small hours got came Frodo, whose turn watch. ‘Why waking?’ asked Frodo. ‘It watch.’ ‘I know,’ answered Aragorn; ‘but shadow threat growing sleep. well draw sword.’ ‘Why?’ said Frodo. ‘Are enemies hand?’ ‘Let us see Sting may show,’ answered Aragorn. Frodo drew elf-blade sheath. dismay edges gleamed dimly night. ‘Orcs!’ said. ‘Not near, yet near, seems.’ ‘I feared much,’ said Aragorn. ‘But maybe side River. light Sting faint, may point spies Mordor roaming slopes Amon Lhaw. never heard Orcs upon Amon Hen. Yet knows may happen evil days, now Minas Tirith longer holds secure passages Anduin. must go warily tomorrow.’ day came fire smoke. Low East black bars cloud fumes great burning. rising sun lit beneath flames murky red; soon climbed clear sky. summit Tol Brandir tipped gold. Frodo looked eastward gazed tall island. sides sprang sheer running water. High tall cliffs steep slopes upon trees climbed, mounting one head another; grey faces inaccessible rock, crowned great spire stone. Many birds circling it, sign living things seen. eaten, Aragorn called Company together. ‘The day come last,’ said: ‘the day choice long delayed. now become Company travelled far fellowship? turn west Boromir go wars Gondor; turn east Fear Shadow; break fellowship go way may choose? Whatever must done soon. long halt here. enemy eastern shore, know; fear Orcs may already side water.’ long silence one spoke moved. ‘Well, Frodo,’ said Aragorn last. ‘I fear burden laid upon you.

Sam, watching master great concern, shook head muttered: ‘Plain pikestaff is, it’s good Sam Gamgee putting spoke now.’ Presently Frodo got walked away; Sam saw others restrained stare him, eyes Boromir followed Frodo intently, passed sight trees foot Amon Hen.

Come now, Frodo, tell us doing? see shadow fear upon you.’ ‘O Wise People!’ interrupted Pippin eagerly. ‘Tell us Black Riders!’ ‘Black Riders?’ said low voices. ‘Why ask Black Riders?’ ‘Because two Black Riders overtaken us today, one done twice,’ said Pippin; ‘only little ago slipped away drew near.’ Elves answer once, spoke together softly tongue. length Gildor turned hobbits. ‘We will speak here,’ said. ‘We think best come now us. custom, time will take road, lodge us tonight, will.’ ‘O Fair Folk! good fortune beyond hope,’ said Pippin.

Frodo remained long awake, talking Gildor. spoke many things, old new, Frodo questioned Gildor much happenings wide world outside Shire. tidings mostly sad ominous: gathering darkness, wars Men, flight Elves. last Frodo asked question nearest heart: ‘Tell me, Gildor, seen Bilbo left us?’ Gildor smiled. ‘Yes,’ answered. ‘Twice. said farewell us spot. saw again, far here.’ say Bilbo, Frodo fell silent. ‘You ask tell much concerns yourself, Frodo,’ said Gildor. ‘But already know little, read face thought behind questions. leaving Shire, yet doubt will find seek, accomplish intend, will return. so?’ ‘It is,’ said Frodo; ‘but thought going secret known Gandalf faithful Sam.’ looked Sam, snoring gently. ‘The secret will reach Enemy us,’ said Gildor. ‘The Enemy?’ said Frodo. ‘Then know leaving Shire?’ ‘I know reason Enemy pursuing you,’ answered Gildor; ‘but perceive – strange indeed though seems me. warn peril now behind you, upon either side.’ ‘You mean Riders? feared servants Enemy.

Fear nothing!FortonightyouareundertheroofofTomBombadil.’ hobbits looked wonder; looked smiled. ‘Fair lady Goldberry!’ said Frodo last, feeling heart moved joy understand. stood times stood enchanted fair elven-voices; spell now laid upon different: less keen lofty delight, deeper nearer mortal heart; marvellous yet strange. ‘Fair lady Goldberry!’ said again. ‘Now joy hidden songs heard made plain me. O slender willow-wand! O clearer clear water! O reed living pool! Fair River-daughter! O spring-time summer-time, spring after!

Goldberry laughed. ‘Welcome!’ said. ‘I heard folk Shire sweet-tongued. see Elf-friend; light eyes ring voice tells it. merry meeting!

Every now caught, among many derry dol merry dol ring ding dillo repeated words: Old Tom Bombadil merry fellow; Bright blue jacket is, boots yellow. ‘Fair lady!’ said Frodo while. ‘Tell me, asking seem foolish, Tom Bombadil?’ ‘He is,’ said Goldberry, staying swift movements smiling.

Come now, merry friends, Tom will refresh you! clean grimy hands, wash weary faces; cast muddy cloaks comb tangles!’ opened door, followed short passage round sharp turn. came low room sloping roof (a penthouse, seemed, built north end house). walls clean stone, mostly covered green hanging mats yellow curtains. floor flagged, strewn fresh green rushes. four deep mattresses, piled white blankets, laid floor along one side. opposite wall long bench laden wide earthenware basins, beside stood brown ewers filled water, cold, steaming hot. soft green slippers set ready beside bed. long, washed refreshed, hobbits seated table, two side, either end sat Goldberry Master. long merry meal. Though hobbits ate, famished hobbits eat, lack. drink drinking-bowls seemed clear cold water, yet went hearts wine set free voices. guests became suddenly aware singing merrily, easier natural talking. last Tom Goldberry rose cleared table swiftly. guests commanded sit quiet, set chairs, footstool tired feet. fire wide hearth them, burning sweet smell, built apple-wood. everything set order, lights room put out, except one lamp pair candles end chimney-shelf. Goldberry came stood them, holding candle; wished good night deep sleep. ‘Have peace now,’ said, ‘until morning! Heed nightly noises! nothing passes door window save moonlight starlight wind hill-top. Good night!’ passed room glimmer rustle. sound footsteps stream falling gently away downhill cool stones quiet night. Tom sat beside silence, tried muster courage ask one many questions meant ask supper. Sleep gathered eyelids. last Frodo spoke: ‘Did hear calling, Master, chance brought moment?’ Tom stirred man shaken pleasant dream. ‘Eh, what?’ said he. ‘Did hear calling? Nay, hear: busy singing. chance brought then, chance call it. plan mine, though waiting you. heard news you, learned wandering. guessed you’d come ere long water: paths lead way, Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he’s mighty singer; it’s hard little folk escape cunning mazes. Tom errand there, dared hinder.’ Tom nodded sleep taking again; went soft singing voice: errand there: gathering water-lilies, green leaves lilies white please pretty lady, last ere year’s end keep winter, flower pretty feet till snows melted. year summer’s end go find her, wide pool, deep clear, far Withywindle; open first spring linger latest. pool long ago found River-daughter, fair young Goldberry sitting rushes. Sweet singing then, heart beating! opened eyes looked sudden glint blue: proved well – now longer go deep along forest-water, year old. passing Old Man Willow’s house side spring-time, till merry spring, River-daughter dances withy-path bathe water. fell silent again; Frodo help asking one question: one desired answered. ‘Tell us, Master,’ said, ‘about Willow-man. he? never heard before.’ ‘No, don’t!’ said Merry Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright. ‘Not now! morning!’ ‘That right!’ said old man. ‘Now time resting. things ill hear world’s shadow. Sleep till morning-light, rest pillow! Heed nightly noise! Fear grey willow!’ took lamp blew out, grasping candle either hand led room. mattresses pillows soft down, blankets white wool. hardly laid deep beds drawn light covers asleep. dead night, Frodo lay dream without light. saw young moon rising; thin light loomed black wall rock, pierced dark arch great gate. seemed Frodo lifted up, passing saw rock-wall circle hills, within plain, midst plain stood pinnacle stone, vast tower made hands. top stood figure man. moon rose seemed hang moment head glistened white hair wind stirred it. dark plain came crying fell voices, howling many wolves. Suddenly shadow, shape great wings, passed across moon. figure lifted arms light flashed staff wielded. mighty eagle swept bore away. voices wailed wolves yammered. noise strong wind blowing, borne sound hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping East. ‘Black Riders!’ thought Frodo wakened, sound hoofs still echoing mind. wondered courage leave safety stone walls. lay motionless, still listening; now silent, last turned fell asleep wandered unremembered dream. side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; change came dreams turned groaned. Suddenly woke, thought waked, yet still heard darkness sound disturbed dream: tip-tap, squeak: noise branches fretting wind, twig-fingers scraping wall window: creak, creak, creak. wondered willow-trees close house; suddenly dreadful feeling ordinary house all, inside willow listening horrible dry creaking voice laughing again. sat up, felt soft pillows yield hands, lay relieved. seemed hear echo words ears: ‘Fear nothing! peace morning! Heed nightly noises!’ went sleep again. sound water Merry heard falling quiet sleep: water streaming gently, spreading, spreading irresistibly round house dark shoreless pool. gurgled walls, rising slowly surely. ‘I drowned!’ thought. ‘It will find way in, drown.’ felt lying soft slimy bog, springing set foot corner cold hard flagstone. remembered lay again. seemed hear remember hearing: ‘Nothing passes doors windows save moonlight starlight wind hill-top.’ little breath sweet air moved curtain. breathed deep fell asleep again. far remember, Sam slept night deep content, logs contented. woke up, four once, morning light. Tom moving room whistling starling. heard stir clapped hands, cried: ‘Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! hearties!’ drew back yellow curtains, hobbits saw covered windows, either end room, one looking east looking west. leapt refreshed. Frodo ran eastern window, found looking kitchen-garden grey dew. half expected see turf right walls, turf pocked hoof-prints. Actually view screened tall line beans poles; far beyond grey top hill loomed sunrise. pale morning: East, behind long clouds lines soiled wool stained red edges, lay glimmering deeps yellow. sky spoke rain come; light broadening quickly, red flowers beans began glow wet green leaves. Pippin looked western window, pool mist. Forest hidden fog. looking sloping cloud-roof above. fold channel mist broken many plumes billows: valley Withywindle. stream ran hill left vanished white shadows. Near hand flower-garden clipped hedge silver-netted, beyond grey shaven grass pale dew-drops. willow-tree seen. ‘Good morning, merry friends!’ cried Tom, opening eastern window wide. cool air flowed in; rainy smell. ‘Sun won’t show face much today, I’m thinking. walking wide, leaping hill-tops, grey dawn began, nosing wind weather, wet grass underfoot, wet sky me. wakened Goldberry singing window; naught wakes hobbit-folk early morning. night little folk wake darkness, sleep light come! Ring ding dillo! Wake now, merry friends! Forget nightly noises! Ring ding dillo del! derry del, hearties! come soon you’ll find breakfast table. come late you’ll grass rain-water!’ Needless say – Tom’s threat sounded serious – hobbits came soon, left table late beginning look rather empty. Neither Tom Goldberry there. Tom heard house, clattering kitchen, stairs, singing outside. room looked westward mist-clouded valley, window open. Water dripped thatched eaves above. finished breakfast clouds joined unbroken roof, straight grey rain came softly steadily down. Behind deep curtain Forest completely veiled. looked window came falling gently flowing rain sky, clear voice Goldberry singing them. hear words, seemed plain song rain-song, sweet showers dry hills, told tale river spring highlands Sea far below. hobbits listened delight; Frodo glad heart, blessed kindly weather, delayed departing. thought going heavy upon moment awoke; guessed now go day. upper wind settled West deeper wetter clouds rolled spill laden rain bare heads Downs. Nothing seen round house falling water. Frodo stood near open door watched white chalky path turn little river milk go bubbling away valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round corner house, waving arms warding rain – indeed sprang threshold seemed quite dry, except boots. took put chimney-corner. sat largest chair called hobbits gather round him. ‘This Goldberry’s washing day,’ said, ‘and autumn-cleaning. wet hobbit-folk – let rest able! It’s good day long tales, questions answers, Tom will start talking.’ told many remarkable stories, sometimes half speaking himself, sometimes looking suddenly bright blue eye deep brows. Often voice turn song, chair dance about. told tales bees flowers, ways trees, strange creatures Forest, evil things good things, things friendly things unfriendly, cruel things kind things, secrets hidden brambles. listened, began understand lives Forest, apart themselves, indeed feel strangers things home. Moving constantly talk Old Man Willow, Frodo learned now enough content him, indeed enough, comfortable lore. Tom’s words laid bare hearts trees thoughts, often dark strange, filled hatred things go free upon earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers usurpers. called Old Forest without reason, indeed ancient, survivor vast forgotten woods; lived yet, ageing quicker hills, fathers fathers trees, remembering times lords. countless years filled pride rooted wisdom, malice. none dangerous Great Willow: heart rotten, strength green; cunning, master winds, song thought ran woods sides river. grey thirsty spirit drew power earth spread fine root-threads ground, invisible twig-fingers air, till dominion nearly trees Forest Hedge Downs. Suddenly Tom’s talk left woods went leaping young stream, bubbling waterfalls, pebbles worn rocks, among small flowers close grass wet crannies, wandering last Downs. heard Great Barrows, green mounds, stonerings upon hills hollows among hills. Sheep bleating flocks. Green walls white walls rose. fortresses heights. Kings little kingdoms fought together, young Sun shone fire red metal new greedy swords. victory defeat; towers fell, fortresses burned, flames went sky. Gold piled biers dead kings queens; mounds covered them, stone doors shut; grass grew all. Sheep walked biting grass, soon hills empty again. shadow came dark places far away, bones stirred mounds. Barrow-wights walked hollow places clink rings cold fingers, gold chains wind. Stone rings grinned ground broken teeth moonlight. hobbits shuddered. Even Shire rumour Barrow-wights Barrow-downs beyond Forest heard. tale hobbit liked listen to, even comfortable fireside far away. four now suddenly remembered joy house driven minds: house Tom Bombadil nestled shoulder dreaded hills. lost thread tale shifted uneasily, looking aside one another. caught words found now wandered strange regions beyond memory beyond waking thought, times world wider, seas flowed straight western Shore; still back Tom went singing ancient starlight, Elf-sires awake. suddenly stopped, saw nodded falling asleep. hobbits sat still him, enchanted; seemed if, spell words, wind gone, clouds dried up, day withdrawn, darkness come East West, sky filled light white stars. Whether morning evening one day many days passed Frodo tell. feel either hungry tired, filled wonder. stars shone window silence heavens seemed round him. spoke last wonder sudden fear silence: ‘Who you, Master?’ asked. ‘Eh, what?’ said Tom sitting up, eyes glinting gloom. ‘Don’t know name yet? That’s answer. Tell me, you, alone, nameless? young old. Eldest, that’s am. Mark words, friends: Tom river trees; Tom remembers first raindrop first acorn. made paths Big People, saw little People arriving. Kings graves Barrow-wights. Elves passed westward, Tom already, seas bent. knew dark stars fearless – Dark Lord came Outside.’ shadow seemed pass window, hobbits glanced hastily panes. turned again, Goldberry stood door behind, framed light. held candle, shielding flame draught hand; light flowed it, sunlight white shell. ‘The rain ended,’ said; ‘and new waters running downhill, stars. Let us now laugh glad!’ ‘And let us food drink!’ cried Tom. ‘Long tales thirsty. long listening’s hungry work, morning, noon, evening!’ jumped chair, bound took candle chimney-shelf lit flame Goldberry held; danced table. Suddenly hopped door disappeared. Quickly returned, bearing large laden tray. Tom Goldberry set table; hobbits sat half wonder half laughter: fair grace Goldberry merry odd caperings Tom. Yet fashion seemed weave single dance, neither hindering other, room, round table; great speed food vessels lights set order. boards blazed candles, white yellow. Tom bowed guests. ‘Supper ready,’ said Goldberry; now hobbits saw clothed silver white girdle, shoes fishes’ mail. Tom clean blue, blue rain-washed forget-me-nots, green stockings. supper even better before. hobbits spell Tom’s words may missed one meal many, food seemed least week eaten. sing even speak much while, paid close attention business. time hearts spirits rose high again, voices rang mirth laughter. eaten, Goldberry sang many songs them, songs began merrily hills fell softly silence; silences saw minds pools waters wider known, looking saw sky stars jewels depths. wished good night left fireside. Tom now seemed wide awake plied questions. appeared already know much families, indeed know much history doings Shire days hardly remembered among hobbits themselves. longer surprised them; made secret owed recent knowledge largely Farmer Maggot, seemed regard person importance imagined. ‘There’s earth old feet, clay fingers; wisdom bones, eyes open,’ said Tom. clear Tom dealings Elves, seemed fashion, news reached Gildor concerning flight Frodo. Indeed much Tom know, cunning questioning, Frodo found telling Bilbo hopes fears told even Gandalf. Tom wagged head down, glint eyes heard Riders. ‘Show precious Ring!’ said suddenly midst story: Frodo, astonishment, drew chain pocket, unfastening Ring handed Tom. seemed grow larger lay moment big brown-skinned hand. suddenly put eye laughed. second hobbits vision, comical alarming, bright blue eye gleaming circle gold. Tom put Ring round end little finger held candlelight. moment hobbits noticed nothing strange this. gasped. sign Tom disappearing! Tom laughed again, spun Ring air – vanished flash. Frodo gave cry – Tom leaned forward handed back smile. Frodo looked closely, rather suspiciously (like one lent trinket juggler). Ring, looked weighed same: Ring always seemed Frodo weigh strangely heavy hand. something prompted make sure. perhaps trifle annoyed Tom seeming make light even Gandalf thought perilously important. waited opportunity, talk going again, Tom telling absurd story badgers queer ways – slipped Ring on. Merry turned towards say something gave start, checked exclamation. Frodo delighted (in way): ring right, Merry staring blankly chair, obviously see him. got crept quietly away fireside towards outer door. ‘Hey there!’ cried Tom, glancing towards seeing look shining eyes. ‘Hey!

That’s came tell me, suppose, though you’ve taken long time come point.’ Poor Mr. Butterbur looked troubled. ‘You’re right, master,’ said, ‘and beg pardon.

Black Riders: sure, think, fear come from——’ ‘They come Mordor,’ said Strider low voice. ‘From Mordor, Barliman, means anything you.’ ‘Save us!’ cried Mr. Butterbur turning pale; name evidently known him. ‘That worst news come Bree time.’ ‘It is,’ said Frodo. ‘Are still willing help me?’ ‘I am,’ said Mr. Butterbur. ‘More ever. Though don’t know likes against, against——’ faltered. ‘Against Shadow East,’ said Strider quietly. ‘Not much, Barliman, every little helps. let Mr. Underhill stay tonight, Mr. Underhill; forget name Baggins, till far away.’ ‘I’ll that,’ said Butterbur. ‘But they’ll find he’s without help me, I’m afraid.

Soon River broadened grew shallow; long stony beaches lay upon east, gravel-shoals water, careful steering needed.

Merry Pippin middle boat ill ease, Boromir sat muttering himself, sometimes biting nails, restlessness doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing paddle driving boat close behind Aragorn’s.

Even paddles use trust Sam one. dusk drew fourth day, looking back bowed heads Frodo Aragorn following boats; drowsy longed camp feel earth toes. Suddenly something caught sight: first stared listlessly, sat rubbed eyes; looked see more. night camped small eyot close western bank. Sam lay rolled blankets beside Frodo. ‘I funny dream hour two stopped, Mr. Frodo,’ said. ‘Or maybe wasn’t dream. Funny anyway.’ ‘Well, it?’ said Frodo, knowing Sam settle told tale, whatever was. ‘I haven’t seen thought anything make smile left Lothlo´rien.’ ‘It wasn’t funny way, Mr. Frodo. queer. wrong, wasn’t dream. best hear it. this: saw log eyes!’ ‘The log’s right,’ said Frodo. ‘There many River. leave eyes!’ ‘That won’t,’ said Sam. ‘’Twas eyes made sit up, speak. saw took log floating along half-light behind Gimli’s boat; didn’t give much heed it. seemed log slowly catching us up. peculiar, might say, seeing floating stream together. saw eyes: two pale sort points, shiny-like, hump near end log.

There’s nothing tell, much. thought heard soft plashing sniffing noise, back; hear lot queer sounds river night.’ lay down, Frodo sat up, huddled blankets, fought sleep. Minutes hours passed slowly, nothing happened. Frodo yielding temptation lie dark shape, hardly visible, floated close one moored boats. long whitish hand dimly seen shot grabbed gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes shone coldly peered inside, lifted gazed Frodo eyot. yard two away, Frodo heard soft hiss intaken breath. stood up, drawing Sting sheath, faced eyes. Immediately light shut off. another hiss splash, dark log-shape shot away downstream night. Aragorn stirred sleep, turned over, sat up. ‘What it?’ whispered, springing coming Frodo. ‘I felt something sleep. drawn sword?’ ‘Gollum,’ answered Frodo. ‘Or least, guess.’ ‘Ah!’ said Aragorn. ‘So know little footpad, you? padded us Moria right Nimrodel. took boats, lying log paddling hands feet. tried catch twice night; slier fox, slippery fish. hoped river-voyage beat him, clever waterman. ‘We try going faster tomorrow. lie now, will keep watch left night. wish lay hands wretch. might make useful. cannot, try lose him. dangerous.

Aragorn’s bidding paddled now long spells, banks went swiftly by. saw little country, journeyed mostly night twilight, resting day, lying hidden land allowed. way time passed without event seventh day. weather still grey overcast, wind East, evening drew night sky away westward cleared, pools faint light, yellow pale green, opened grey shores cloud. white rind new Moon seen glimmering remote lakes. Sam looked puckered brows. next day country either side began change rapidly. banks began rise grow stony. Soon passing hilly rocky land, shores steep slopes buried deep brakes thorn sloe, tangled brambles creepers. Behind stood low crumbling cliffs, chimneys grey weathered stone dark ivy; beyond rose high ridges crowned wind-writhen firs. drawing near grey hill-country Emyn Muil, southern march Wilderland. many birds cliffs rockchimneys, day high air flocks birds circling, black pale sky. lay camp day Aragorn watched flights doubtfully, wondering Gollum mischief news voyage now moving wilderness. Later sun setting, Company stirring getting ready start again, descried dark spot fading light: great bird high far off, now wheeling, now flying slowly southwards. ‘What that, Legolas?’ asked, pointing northern sky. ‘Is it, think, eagle?’ ‘Yes,’ said Legolas. ‘It eagle, hunting eagle. wonder forebodes. far mountains.’ ‘We will start fully dark,’ said Aragorn. eighth night journey came. silent windless; grey east wind passed away. thin crescent Moon fallen early pale sunset, sky clear above, though far away South great ranges cloud still shone faintly, West stars glinted bright. ‘Come!’ said Aragorn. ‘We will venture one journey night. coming reaches River know well; never journeyed water parts before, rapids Sarn Gebir. right reckoning, still many miles ahead. Still dangerous places even come there: rocks stony eyots stream. must keep sharp watch try paddle swiftly.’ Sam leading boat given task watchman. lay forward peering gloom. night grew dark, stars strangely bright, glimmer face River. close midnight, drifting while, hardly using paddles, suddenly Sam cried out. yards ahead dark shapes loomed stream heard swirl racing water. swift current swung left, towards eastern shore channel clear. swept aside travellers see, now close, pale foam River lashing sharp rocks thrust far stream ridge teeth. boats huddled together. ‘Hoy there, Aragorn!’ shouted Boromir, boat bumped leader. ‘This madness! dare Rapids night! boat live Sarn Gebir, night day.’ ‘Back, back!’ cried Aragorn. ‘Turn!

Now dark ominous loomed night. ‘All together, paddle!’ shouted Boromir. ‘Paddle! driven shoals.’ Even spoke Frodo felt keel beneath grate upon stone. moment twang bowstrings: several arrows whistled them, fell among them. One smote Frodo shoulders lurched forward cry, letting go paddle: arrow fell back, foiled hidden coat mail. Another passed Aragorn’s hood; third stood fast gunwale second boat, close Merry’s hand. Sam thought glimpse black figures running fro upon long shingle-banks lay eastern shore. seemed near. ‘Yrch!’ said Legolas, falling tongue. ‘Orcs!’ cried Gimli. ‘Gollum’s doing, I’ll bound,’ said Sam Frodo. ‘And nice place choose, too.

Legolas laid paddle took bow brought Lo´rien. sprang ashore climbed paces bank. Stringing bow fitting arrow turned, peering back River darkness. Across water shrill cries, nothing seen. Frodo looked Elf standing tall him, gazed night, seeking mark shoot at. head dark, crowned sharp white stars glittered black pools sky behind. now rising sailing South great clouds advanced, sending dark outriders starry fields. sudden dread fell Company. ‘Elbereth Gilthoniel!’ sighed Legolas looked up. Even so, dark shape, cloud yet cloud, moved far swiftly, came blackness South, sped towards Company, blotting light approached. Soon appeared great winged creature, blacker pits night. Fierce voices rose greet across water. Frodo felt sudden chill running clutching heart; deadly cold, memory old wound, shoulder. crouched down, hide. Suddenly great bow Lo´rien sang. Shrill went arrow elven-string. Frodo looked up. Almost winged shape swerved. harsh croaking scream, fell air, vanishing gloom eastern shore. sky clean again. tumult many voices far away, cursing wailing darkness, silence. Neither shaft cry came east night. Aragorn led boats back upstream. felt way along water’s edge distance, found small shallow bay. low trees grew close water, behind rose steep rocky bank. Company decided stay await dawn: useless attempt move night. made camp lit fire, lay huddled boats, moored close together. ‘Praised bow Galadriel, hand eye Legolas!’ said Gimli, munched wafer lembas. ‘That mighty shot dark, friend!’ ‘But say hit?’ said Legolas. ‘I cannot,’ said Gimli. ‘But glad shadow came nearer. liked all. much reminded shadow Moria – shadow Balrog,’ ended whisper. ‘It Balrog,’ said Frodo, still shivering chill come upon him. ‘It something colder. think was——’ paused fell silent. ‘What think?’ asked Boromir eagerly, leaning boat, trying catch glimpse Frodo’s face. ‘I think—No, will say,’ answered Frodo. ‘Whatever was, fall dismayed enemies.’ ‘So seems,’ said Aragorn. ‘Yet are, many, will next, know. night must sleepless! Dark hides us now. day will show tell? weapons close hand!’ Sam sat tapping hilt sword counting fingers, looking sky. ‘It’s strange,’ murmured. ‘The Moon’s Shire Wilderland, be. either it’s running, I’m wrong reckoning.

Yet beneath Sun things must wear end last.’ ‘But wearing slow Lo´rien,’ said Frodo. ‘The power Lady it. Rich hours, though short seem, Caras Galadhon, Galadriel wields Elvenring.’ ‘That said outside Lo´rien, even me,’ said Aragorn. ‘Speak it! is, Sam: land lost count. time flowed swiftly us, Elves. old moon passed, new moon waxed waned world outside, tarried there. yestereve new moon came again. Winter nearly gone.

Slowly dawn grew pale light, diffused shadowless. mist River, white fog swathed shore; far bank seen. ‘I can’t abide fog,’ said Sam; ‘but seems lucky one. Now perhaps away without cursed goblins seeing us.’ ‘Perhaps so,’ said Aragorn. ‘But will hard find path unless fog lifts little later on. must find path, pass Sarn Gebir come Emyn Muil.’ ‘I see pass Rapids follow River further,’ said Boromir. ‘If Emyn Muil lie us, abandon cockle-boats, strike westward southward, come Entwash cross land.’ ‘We can, making Minas Tirith,’ said Aragorn, ‘but yet agreed. course may perilous sounds. vale Entwash flat fenny, fog deadly peril foot laden. abandon boats must. River least path missed.’ ‘But Enemy holds eastern bank,’ objected Boromir. ‘And even pass Gates Argonath come unmolested Tindrock, will then? Leap Falls land marshes?’ ‘No!’ answered Aragorn. ‘Say rather will bear boats ancient way Rauros-foot, take water again. know, Boromir, choose forget North Stair, high seat upon Amon Hen, made days great kings? least mind stand high place again, decide course. There, maybe, see sign will guide us.’ Boromir held long choice; became plain Frodo follow Aragorn, wherever went, gave in. ‘It way Men Minas Tirith desert friends need,’ said, ‘and will need strength, reach Tindrock. tall isle will go, further. turn home, alone help earned reward companionship.’ day now growing, fog lifted little. decided Aragorn Legolas go forward along shore, others remained boats. Aragorn hoped find way carry boats baggage smoother water beyond Rapids. ‘Boats Elves sink, maybe,’ said, ‘but say come Sarn Gebir alive. None done yet. road made Men Gondor region, even great days realm reach Anduin beyond Emyn Muil; portage-way somewhere western shore, find it. yet perished; light boats used journey Wilderland Osgiliath, still years ago, Orcs Mordor began multiply.’ ‘Seldom life boat come North, Orcs prowl east-shore,’ said Boromir. ‘If go forward, peril will grow every mile, even find path.’ ‘Peril lies ahead every southward road,’ answered Aragorn. ‘Wait us one day. return time, will know evil indeed befallen us. must take new leader follow best can.’ heavy heart Frodo saw Aragorn Legolas climb steep bank vanish mists; fears proved groundless. two three hours passed, barely mid-day, shadowy shapes explorers appeared again. ‘All well,’ said Aragorn, clambered bank. ‘There track, leads good landing still serviceable. distance great: head Rapids half mile us, little mile long. far beyond stream becomes clear smooth again, though runs swiftly. hardest task will boats baggage old portage-way. found it, lies well back water-side here, runs lee rock-wall, furlong shore. find northward landing lies. still remains, must passed yesterday night. might labour far upstream yet miss fog. fear must leave River now, make portageway best here.’ ‘That easy, even Men,’ said Boromir. ‘Yet will try it,’ said Aragorn. ‘Aye, will,’ said Gimli. ‘The legs Men will lag rough road, Dwarf goes on, burden twice weight, Master Boromir!’ task proved hard indeed, yet end done. goods taken boats brought top bank, level space. boats drawn water carried up. far less heavy expected. tree growing Elvish country made even Legolas knew; wood tough yet strangely light. Merry Pippin alone carry boat ease along flat. Nonetheless needed strength two Men lift haul ground Company now cross. sloped away River, tumbled waste grey limestone-boulders, many hidden holes shrouded weeds bushes; thickets brambles, sheer dells; boggy pools fed waters trickling terraces inland. One one Boromir Aragorn carried boats, others toiled scrambled baggage. last removed laid portage-way. little hindrance, save sprawling briars many fallen stones, moved forward together. Fog still hung veils upon crumbling rock-wall, left mist shrouded River: hear rushing foaming sharp shelves stony teeth Sarn Gebir, see it. Twice made journey, brought safe southern landing. portage-way, turning back water-side, ran gently shallow edge little pool. seemed scooped river-side, hand, water swirling Sarn Gebir low pier rock jutted way stream. Beyond shore rose sheer grey cliff, passage foot. Already short afternoon past, dim cloudy dusk closing in. sat beside water listening confused rush roar Rapids hidden mist; tired sleepy, hearts gloomy dying day. ‘Well, are, must pass another night,’ said Boromir. ‘We need sleep, even Aragorn mind pass Gates Argonath night, tired – except, doubt, sturdy dwarf.’ Gimli made reply: nodding sat. ‘Let us rest much now,’ said Aragorn. ‘Tomorrow must journey day again. Unless weather changes cheats us, good chance slipping through, unseen eyes eastern shore. tonight two must watch together turns: three hours one guard.’ Nothing happened night worse brief drizzle rain hour dawn. soon fully light started. Already fog thinning. kept close western side, see dim shapes low cliffs rising higher, shadowy walls feet hurrying river. mid-morning clouds drew lower, began rain heavily. drew skin-covers boats prevent flooded, drifted on; little seen grey falling curtains. rain, however, last long. Slowly sky grew lighter, suddenly clouds broke, draggled fringes trailed away northward River. fogs mists gone. travellers lay wide ravine, great rocky sides clung, upon shelves narrow crevices, thrawn trees. channel grew narrower River swifter. Now speeding along little hope stopping turning, whatever might meet ahead. lane pale-blue sky, around dark overshadowed River, black, shutting sun, hills Emyn Muil, opening seen. Frodo peering forward saw distance two great rocks approaching: great pinnacles pillars stone seemed. Tall sheer ominous stood upon either side stream. narrow gap appeared them, River swept boats towards it. ‘Behold Argonath, Pillars Kings!’ cried Aragorn. ‘We pass soon. Keep boats line, far apart can! Hold middle stream!’ Frodo borne towards great pillars rose towers meet him. Giants seemed him, vast grey figures silent threatening. saw indeed shaped fashioned: craft power old wrought upon them, still preserved suns rains forgotten years mighty likenesses hewn. Upon great pedestals founded deep waters stood two great kings stone: still blurred eyes crannied brows frowned upon North. left hand raised palm outwards gesture warning; right hand axe; upon head crumbling helm crown. Great power majesty still wore, silent wardens long-vanished kingdom. Awe fear fell upon Frodo, cowered down, shutting eyes daring look boat drew near. Even Boromir bowed head boats whirled by, frail fleeting little leaves, enduring shadow sentinels Nu´menor. passed dark chasm Gates. Sheer rose dreadful cliffs unguessed heights either side. Far dim sky. black waters roared echoed, wind screamed them. Frodo crouching knees heard Sam front muttering groaning: ‘What place! horrible place! let boat, I’ll never wet toes puddle again, let alone river!’ ‘Fear not!’ said strange voice behind him. Frodo turned saw Strider, yet Strider; weatherworn Ranger longer there. stern sat Aragorn son Arathorn, proud erect, guiding boat skilful strokes; hood cast back, dark hair blowing wind, light eyes: king returning exile land. ‘Fear not!’ said. ‘Long desired look upon likenesses Isildur Ana´rion, sires old. shadow Elessar, Elfstone son Arathorn House Valandil Isildur’s son, heir Elendil, naught dread!’ light eyes faded, spoke himself: ‘Would Gandalf here! heart yearns Minas Anor walls city! whither now go?’ chasm long dark, filled noise wind rushing water echoing stone. bent somewhat towards west first dark ahead; soon Frodo saw tall gap light him, growing. Swiftly drew near, suddenly boats shot through, wide clear light. sun, already long fallen noon, shining windy sky. pent waters spread long oval lake, pale Nen Hithoel, fenced steep grey hills whose sides clad trees, heads bare, cold-gleaming sunlight. far southern end rose three peaks. midmost stood somewhat forward others sundered them, island waters, flowing River flung pale shimmering arms.

Nonetheless night wore Aragorn grew uneasy, tossing often sleep waking. small hours got came Frodo, whose turn watch. ‘Why waking?’ asked Frodo. ‘It watch.’ ‘I know,’ answered Aragorn; ‘but shadow threat growing sleep. well draw sword.’ ‘Why?’ said Frodo. ‘Are enemies hand?’ ‘Let us see Sting may show,’ answered Aragorn. Frodo drew elf-blade sheath. dismay edges gleamed dimly night. ‘Orcs!’ said. ‘Not near, yet near, seems.’ ‘I feared much,’ said Aragorn. ‘But maybe side River. light Sting faint, may point spies Mordor roaming slopes Amon Lhaw. never heard Orcs upon Amon Hen. Yet knows may happen evil days, now Minas Tirith longer holds secure passages Anduin. must go warily tomorrow.’ day came fire smoke. Low East black bars cloud fumes great burning. rising sun lit beneath flames murky red; soon climbed clear sky. summit Tol Brandir tipped gold. Frodo looked eastward gazed tall island. sides sprang sheer running water. High tall cliffs steep slopes upon trees climbed, mounting one head another; grey faces inaccessible rock, crowned great spire stone. Many birds circling it, sign living things seen. eaten, Aragorn called Company together. ‘The day come last,’ said: ‘the day choice long delayed. now become Company travelled far fellowship? turn west Boromir go wars Gondor; turn east Fear Shadow; break fellowship go way may choose? Whatever must done soon. long halt here. enemy eastern shore, know; fear Orcs may already side water.’ long silence one spoke moved. ‘Well, Frodo,’ said Aragorn last. ‘I fear burden laid upon you.

Sam, watching master great concern, shook head muttered: ‘Plain pikestaff is, it’s good Sam Gamgee putting spoke now.’ Presently Frodo got walked away; Sam saw others restrained stare him, eyes Boromir followed Frodo intently, passed sight trees foot Amon Hen.

Heed nightly noises! nothing passes door window save moonlight starlight wind hill-top. Good night!’ passed room glimmer rustle. sound footsteps stream falling gently away downhill cool stones quiet night. Tom sat beside silence, tried muster courage ask one questions meant ask supper. Sleep gathered eyelids. last Frodo spoke: ‘Did hear calling, Master, chance brought moment?’ Tom stirred man shaken pleasant dream. ‘Eh, what?’ said he. ‘Did hear calling? Nay, hear: busy singing. chance brought then, chance call it. plan mine, though waiting you. heard news you, learned wandering. guessed you’d come ere long water: paths lead way, Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he’s mighty singer; it’s hard little folk escape cunning mazes. Tom errand there, dared hinder.’ Tom nodded sleep taking again; went soft singing voice: errand there: gathering water-lilies, green leaves lilies white please pretty lady, last ere year’s end keep winter, flower pretty feet till snows melted. year summer’s end go find her, wide pool, deep clear, far Withywindle; open first spring linger latest. pool long ago found River-daughter, fair young Goldberry sitting rushes. Sweet singing then, heart beating! opened eyes looked sudden glint blue: proved well – longer go deep along forest-water, year old. passing Old Man Willow’s house side spring-time, till merry spring, River-daughter dances withy-path bathe water. fell silent again; Frodo help asking one question: one desired answered. ‘Tell us, Master,’ said, ‘about Willow-man. he? never heard before.’ ‘No, don’t!’ said Merry Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright. ‘Not now! morning!’ ‘That right!’ said old man. ‘Now time resting. things ill hear world’s shadow. Sleep till morning-light, rest pillow! Heed nightly noise! Fear grey willow!’ took lamp blew out, grasping candle either hand led room. mattresses pillows soft down, blankets white wool. hardly laid deep beds drawn light covers asleep. dead night, Frodo lay dream without light. saw young moon rising; thin light loomed black wall rock, pierced dark arch great gate. seemed Frodo lifted up, passing saw rock-wall circle hills, within plain, midst plain stood pinnacle stone, vast tower made hands. top stood figure man. moon rose seemed hang moment head glistened white hair wind stirred it. dark plain came crying fell voices, howling wolves. Suddenly shadow, shape great wings, passed across moon. figure lifted arms light flashed staff wielded. mighty eagle swept bore away. voices wailed wolves yammered. noise strong wind blowing, borne sound hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping East. ‘Black Riders!’ thought Frodo wakened, sound hoofs still echoing mind. wondered courage leave safety stone walls. lay motionless, still listening; silent, last turned fell asleep wandered unremembered dream. side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; change came dreams turned groaned. Suddenly woke, thought waked, yet still heard darkness sound disturbed dream: tip-tap, squeak: noise branches fretting wind, twig-fingers scraping wall window: creak, creak, creak. wondered willow-trees close house; suddenly dreadful feeling ordinary house all, inside willow listening horrible dry creaking voice laughing again. sat up, felt soft pillows yield hands, lay relieved. seemed hear echo words ears: ‘Fear nothing! peace morning! Heed nightly noises!’ went sleep again. sound water Merry heard falling quiet sleep: water streaming gently, spreading, spreading irresistibly round house dark shoreless pool. gurgled walls, rising slowly surely. ‘I drowned!’ thought. ‘It will find way in, drown.’ felt lying soft slimy bog, springing set foot corner cold hard flagstone. remembered lay again. seemed hear remember hearing: ‘Nothing passes doors windows save moonlight starlight wind hill-top.’ little breath sweet air moved curtain. breathed deep fell asleep again. far remember, Sam slept night deep content, logs contented. woke up, four once, morning light. Tom moving room whistling starling. heard stir clapped hands, cried: ‘Hey!

Frodo ran eastern window, found looking kitchen-garden grey dew. half expected see turf right walls, turf pocked hoof-prints. Actually view screened tall line beans poles; far beyond grey top hill loomed sunrise. pale morning: East, behind long clouds lines soiled wool stained red edges, lay glimmering deeps yellow. sky spoke rain come; light broadening quickly, red flowers beans began glow wet green leaves.

Near hand flower-garden clipped hedge silver-netted, beyond grey shaven grass pale dew-drops. willow-tree seen. ‘Good morning, merry friends!’ cried Tom, opening eastern window wide. cool air flowed in; rainy smell. ‘Sun won’t show face much today, I’m thinking. walking wide, leaping hill-tops, grey dawn began, nosing wind weather, wet grass underfoot, wet sky me. wakened Goldberry singing window; naught wakes hobbit-folk early morning. night little folk wake darkness, sleep light come! Ring ding dillo! Wake now, merry friends! Forget nightly noises! Ring ding dillo del! derry del, hearties! come soon you’ll find breakfast table. come late you’ll grass rain-water!’ Needless say – Tom’s threat sounded serious – hobbits came soon, left table late beginning look rather empty. Neither Tom Goldberry there. Tom heard house, clattering kitchen, stairs, singing outside. room looked westward mist-clouded valley, window open. Water dripped thatched eaves above. finished breakfast clouds joined unbroken roof, straight grey rain came softly steadily down. Behind deep curtain Forest completely veiled. looked window came falling gently flowing rain sky, clear voice Goldberry singing them. hear words, seemed plain song rain-song, sweet showers dry hills, told tale river spring highlands Sea far below. hobbits listened delight; Frodo glad heart, blessed kindly weather, delayed departing. thought going heavy upon moment awoke; guessed go day. upper wind settled West deeper wetter clouds rolled spill laden rain bare heads Downs. Nothing seen round house falling water. Frodo stood near open door watched white chalky path turn little river milk go bubbling away valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round corner house, waving arms warding rain – indeed sprang threshold seemed quite dry, except boots. took put chimney-corner. sat largest chair called hobbits gather round him. ‘This Goldberry’s washing day,’ said, ‘and autumn-cleaning. wet hobbit-folk – let rest able! It’s good day long tales, questions answers, Tom will start talking.’ told remarkable stories, sometimes half speaking himself, sometimes looking suddenly bright blue eye deep brows. Often voice turn song, chair dance about. told tales bees flowers, ways trees, strange creatures Forest, evil things good things, things friendly things unfriendly, cruel things kind things, secrets hidden brambles. listened, began understand lives Forest, apart themselves, indeed feel strangers things home. Moving constantly talk Old Man Willow, Frodo learned enough content him, indeed enough, comfortable lore. Tom’s words laid bare hearts trees thoughts, often dark strange, filled hatred things go free upon earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers usurpers. called Old Forest without reason, indeed ancient, survivor vast forgotten woods; lived yet, ageing quicker hills, fathers fathers trees, remembering times lords. countless years filled pride rooted wisdom, malice. none dangerous Great Willow: heart rotten, strength green; cunning, master winds, song thought ran woods sides river. grey thirsty spirit drew power earth spread fine root-threads ground, invisible twig-fingers air, till dominion nearly trees Forest Hedge Downs. Suddenly Tom’s talk left woods went leaping young stream, bubbling waterfalls, pebbles worn rocks, among small flowers close grass wet crannies, wandering last Downs. heard Great Barrows, green mounds, stonerings upon hills hollows among hills. Sheep bleating flocks. Green walls white walls rose. fortresses heights. Kings little kingdoms fought together, young Sun shone fire red metal new greedy swords. victory defeat; towers fell, fortresses burned, flames went sky. Gold piled biers dead kings queens; mounds covered them, stone doors shut; grass grew all. Sheep walked biting grass, soon hills empty again. shadow came dark places far away, bones stirred mounds. Barrow-wights walked hollow places clink rings cold fingers, gold chains wind. Stone rings grinned ground broken teeth moonlight. hobbits shuddered. Even Shire rumour Barrow-wights Barrow-downs beyond Forest heard. tale hobbit liked listen to, even comfortable fireside far away. four suddenly remembered joy house driven minds: house Tom Bombadil nestled shoulder dreaded hills. lost thread tale shifted uneasily, looking aside one another. caught words found wandered strange regions beyond memory beyond waking thought, times world wider, seas flowed straight western Shore; still back Tom went singing ancient starlight, Elf-sires awake. suddenly stopped, saw nodded falling asleep. hobbits sat still him, enchanted; seemed if, spell words, wind gone, clouds dried up, day withdrawn, darkness come East West, sky filled light white stars. Whether morning evening one day days passed Frodo tell. feel either hungry tired, filled wonder. stars shone window silence heavens seemed round him. spoke last wonder sudden fear silence: ‘Who you, Master?’ asked. ‘Eh, what?’ said Tom sitting up, eyes glinting gloom. ‘Don’t know name yet? That’s answer. Tell me, you, alone, nameless? young old. Eldest, that’s am. Mark words, friends: Tom river trees; Tom remembers first raindrop first acorn. made paths Big People, saw little People arriving. Kings graves Barrow-wights. Elves passed westward, Tom already, seas bent. knew dark stars fearless – Dark Lord came Outside.’ shadow seemed pass window, hobbits glanced hastily panes. turned again, Goldberry stood door behind, framed light. held candle, shielding flame draught hand; light flowed it, sunlight white shell. ‘The rain ended,’ said; ‘and new waters running downhill, stars. Let us laugh glad!’ ‘And let us food drink!’ cried Tom. ‘Long tales thirsty. long listening’s hungry work, morning, noon, evening!’ jumped chair, bound took candle chimney-shelf lit flame Goldberry held; danced table. Suddenly hopped door disappeared. Quickly returned, bearing large laden tray. Tom Goldberry set table; hobbits sat half wonder half laughter: fair grace Goldberry merry odd caperings Tom. Yet fashion seemed weave single dance, neither hindering other, room, round table; great speed food vessels lights set order. boards blazed candles, white yellow. Tom bowed guests. ‘Supper ready,’ said Goldberry; hobbits saw clothed silver white girdle, shoes fishes’ mail. Tom clean blue, blue rain-washed forget-me-nots, green stockings. supper even better before. hobbits spell Tom’s words may missed one meal many, food seemed least week eaten. sing even speak much while, paid close attention business. time hearts spirits rose high again, voices rang mirth laughter. eaten, Goldberry sang songs them, songs began merrily hills fell softly silence; silences saw minds pools waters wider known, looking saw sky stars jewels depths. wished good night left fireside. Tom seemed wide awake plied questions. appeared already know much families, indeed know much history doings Shire days hardly remembered among hobbits themselves. longer surprised them; made secret owed recent knowledge largely Farmer Maggot, seemed regard person importance imagined. ‘There’s earth old feet, clay fingers; wisdom bones, eyes open,’ said Tom. clear Tom dealings Elves, seemed fashion, news reached Gildor concerning flight Frodo. Indeed much Tom know, cunning questioning, Frodo found telling Bilbo hopes fears told even Gandalf. Tom wagged head down, glint eyes heard Riders. ‘Show precious Ring!’ said suddenly midst story: Frodo, astonishment, drew chain pocket, unfastening Ring handed Tom. seemed grow larger lay moment big brown-skinned hand. suddenly put eye laughed. second hobbits vision, comical alarming, bright blue eye gleaming circle gold. Tom put Ring round end little finger held candlelight. moment hobbits noticed nothing strange this. gasped. sign Tom disappearing! Tom laughed again, spun Ring air – vanished flash. Frodo gave cry – Tom leaned forward handed back smile. Frodo looked closely, rather suspiciously (like one lent trinket juggler). Ring, looked weighed same: Ring always seemed Frodo weigh strangely heavy hand. something prompted make sure. perhaps trifle annoyed Tom seeming make light even Gandalf thought perilously important. waited opportunity, talk going again, Tom telling absurd story badgers queer ways – slipped Ring on. Merry turned towards say something gave start, checked exclamation. Frodo delighted (in way): ring right, Merry staring blankly chair, obviously see him. got crept quietly away fireside towards outer door. ‘Hey there!’ cried Tom, glancing towards seeing look shining eyes. ‘Hey! Come Frodo, there! a-going? Old Tom Bombadil’s blind yet. Take golden ring! hand’s fair without it. Come back! Leave game sit beside me! must talk more, think morning. Tom must teach right road, keep feet wandering.’ Frodo laughed (trying feel pleased), taking Ring came sat again. Tom told reckoned Sun shine tomorrow, glad morning, setting hopeful. well start early; weather country thing even Tom sure long, change sometimes quicker change jacket. ‘I weather-master,’ said he; ‘nor aught goes two legs.’ advice decided make nearly due North house, western lower slopes Downs: might hope way strike East Road day’s journey, avoid Barrows. told afraid – mind business. ‘Keep green grass.

There’s nothing tell, much. thought heard soft plashing sniffing noise, back; hear lot queer sounds river night.’ lay down, Frodo sat up, huddled blankets, fought sleep. Minutes hours passed slowly, nothing happened. Frodo yielding temptation lie dark shape, hardly visible, floated close one moored boats. long whitish hand dimly seen shot grabbed gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes shone coldly peered inside, lifted gazed Frodo eyot. yard two away, Frodo heard soft hiss intaken breath. stood up, drawing Sting sheath, faced eyes. Immediately light shut off. another hiss splash, dark log-shape shot away downstream night. Aragorn stirred sleep, turned over, sat up. ‘What it?’ whispered, springing coming Frodo. ‘I felt something sleep. drawn sword?’ ‘Gollum,’ answered Frodo. ‘Or least, guess.’ ‘Ah!’ said Aragorn. ‘So know little footpad, you? padded us Moria right Nimrodel. took boats, lying log paddling hands feet. tried catch twice night; slier fox, slippery fish. hoped river-voyage beat him, clever waterman. ‘We try going faster tomorrow. lie now, will keep watch left night. wish lay hands wretch. might make useful. cannot, try lose him. dangerous. Quite apart murder night account, may put enemy track.’ night passed without Gollum showing much shadow again. Company kept sharp look-out, saw Gollum voyage lasted. still following, wary cunning. Aragorn’s bidding paddled long spells, banks went swiftly by. saw little country, journeyed mostly night twilight, resting day, lying hidden land allowed. way time passed without event seventh day. weather still grey overcast, wind East, evening drew night sky away westward cleared, pools faint light, yellow pale green, opened grey shores cloud. white rind new Moon seen glimmering remote lakes.

Soon passing hilly rocky land, shores steep slopes buried deep brakes thorn sloe, tangled brambles creepers.

Later sun setting, Company stirring getting ready start again, descried dark spot fading light: great bird high far off, wheeling, flying slowly southwards. ‘What that, Legolas?’ asked, pointing northern sky. ‘Is it, think, eagle?’ ‘Yes,’ said Legolas. ‘It eagle, hunting eagle. wonder forebodes. far mountains.’ ‘We will start fully dark,’ said Aragorn. eighth night journey came. silent windless; grey east wind passed away. thin crescent Moon fallen early pale sunset, sky clear above, though far away South great ranges cloud still shone faintly, West stars glinted bright. ‘Come!’ said Aragorn. ‘We will venture one journey night. coming reaches River know well; never journeyed water parts before, rapids Sarn Gebir. right reckoning, still miles ahead. Still dangerous places even come there: rocks stony eyots stream. must keep sharp watch try paddle swiftly.’ Sam leading boat given task watchman. lay forward peering gloom. night grew dark, stars strangely bright, glimmer face River. close midnight, drifting while, hardly using paddles, suddenly Sam cried out. yards ahead dark shapes loomed stream heard swirl racing water. swift current swung left, towards eastern shore channel clear. swept aside travellers see, close, pale foam River lashing sharp rocks thrust far stream ridge teeth. boats huddled together. ‘Hoy there, Aragorn!’ shouted Boromir, boat bumped leader. ‘This madness! dare Rapids night! boat live Sarn Gebir, night day.’ ‘Back, back!’ cried Aragorn. ‘Turn!

Sam thought glimpse black figures running fro upon long shingle-banks lay eastern shore. seemed near. ‘Yrch!’ said Legolas, falling tongue. ‘Orcs!’ cried Gimli. ‘Gollum’s doing, I’ll bound,’ said Sam Frodo. ‘And nice place choose, too.

Legolas laid paddle took bow brought Lo´rien. sprang ashore climbed paces bank. Stringing bow fitting arrow turned, peering back River darkness. Across water shrill cries, nothing seen. Frodo looked Elf standing tall him, gazed night, seeking mark shoot at. head dark, crowned sharp white stars glittered black pools sky behind. rising sailing South great clouds advanced, sending dark outriders starry fields. sudden dread fell Company. ‘Elbereth Gilthoniel!’ sighed Legolas looked up. Even so, dark shape, cloud yet cloud, moved far swiftly, came blackness South, sped towards Company, blotting light approached. Soon appeared great winged creature, blacker pits night. Fierce voices rose greet across water. Frodo felt sudden chill running clutching heart; deadly cold, memory old wound, shoulder. crouched down, hide. Suddenly great bow Lo´rien sang. Shrill went arrow elven-string. Frodo looked up. Almost winged shape swerved. harsh croaking scream, fell air, vanishing gloom eastern shore. sky clean again. tumult voices far away, cursing wailing darkness, silence. Neither shaft cry came east night. Aragorn led boats back upstream. felt way along water’s edge distance, found small shallow bay. low trees grew close water, behind rose steep rocky bank. Company decided stay await dawn: useless attempt move night. made camp lit fire, lay huddled boats, moored close together. ‘Praised bow Galadriel, hand eye Legolas!’ said Gimli, munched wafer lembas. ‘That mighty shot dark, friend!’ ‘But say hit?’ said Legolas. ‘I cannot,’ said Gimli. ‘But glad shadow came nearer. liked all. much reminded shadow Moria – shadow Balrog,’ ended whisper. ‘It Balrog,’ said Frodo, still shivering chill come upon him. ‘It something colder. think was——’ paused fell silent. ‘What think?’ asked Boromir eagerly, leaning boat, trying catch glimpse Frodo’s face. ‘I think—No, will say,’ answered Frodo. ‘Whatever was, fall dismayed enemies.’ ‘So seems,’ said Aragorn. ‘Yet are, many, will next, know. night must sleepless! Dark hides us now. day will show tell? weapons close hand!’ Sam sat tapping hilt sword counting fingers, looking sky. ‘It’s strange,’ murmured. ‘The Moon’s Shire Wilderland, be. either it’s running, I’m wrong reckoning.

Elves world moves, moves swift slow. Swift, change little, fleets by: grief them. Slow, need count running years, themselves. passing seasons ripples repeated long long stream. Yet beneath Sun things must wear end last.’ ‘But wearing slow Lo´rien,’ said Frodo. ‘The power Lady it. Rich hours, though short seem, Caras Galadhon, Galadriel wields Elvenring.’ ‘That said outside Lo´rien, even me,’ said Aragorn. ‘Speak it! is, Sam: land lost count. time flowed swiftly us, Elves. old moon passed, new moon waxed waned world outside, tarried there. yestereve new moon came again. Winter nearly gone. Time flows spring little hope.’ night passed silently. voice call heard across water. travellers huddled boats felt changing weather. air grew warm still great moist clouds floated South distant seas. rushing River rocks rapids seemed grow louder closer. twigs trees began drip. day came mood world become soft sad. Slowly dawn grew pale light, diffused shadowless. mist River, white fog swathed shore; far bank seen. ‘I can’t abide fog,’ said Sam; ‘but seems lucky one. perhaps away without cursed goblins seeing us.’ ‘Perhaps so,’ said Aragorn. ‘But will hard find path unless fog lifts little later on. must find path, pass Sarn Gebir come Emyn Muil.’ ‘I see pass Rapids follow River further,’ said Boromir. ‘If Emyn Muil lie us, abandon cockle-boats, strike westward southward, come Entwash cross land.’ ‘We can, making Minas Tirith,’ said Aragorn, ‘but yet agreed. course may perilous sounds. vale Entwash flat fenny, fog deadly peril foot laden. abandon boats must.

There, maybe, see sign will guide us.’ Boromir held long choice; became plain Frodo follow Aragorn, wherever went, gave in. ‘It way Men Minas Tirith desert friends need,’ said, ‘and will need strength, reach Tindrock. tall isle will go, further. turn home, alone help earned reward companionship.’ day growing, fog lifted little. decided Aragorn Legolas go forward along shore, others remained boats. Aragorn hoped find way carry boats baggage smoother water beyond Rapids. ‘Boats Elves sink, maybe,’ said, ‘but say come Sarn Gebir alive. None done yet. road made Men Gondor region, even great days realm reach Anduin beyond Emyn Muil; portage-way somewhere western shore, find it. yet perished; light boats used journey Wilderland Osgiliath, still years ago, Orcs Mordor began multiply.’ ‘Seldom life boat come North, Orcs prowl east-shore,’ said Boromir. ‘If go forward, peril will grow every mile, even find path.’ ‘Peril lies ahead every southward road,’ answered Aragorn. ‘Wait us one day. return time, will know evil indeed befallen us. must take new leader follow best can.’ heavy heart Frodo saw Aragorn Legolas climb steep bank vanish mists; fears proved groundless. two three hours passed, barely mid-day, shadowy shapes explorers appeared again. ‘All well,’ said Aragorn, clambered bank. ‘There track, leads good landing still serviceable. distance great: head Rapids half mile us, little mile long. far beyond stream becomes clear smooth again, though runs swiftly. hardest task will boats baggage old portage-way. found it, lies well back water-side here, runs lee rock-wall, furlong shore. find northward landing lies. still remains, must passed yesterday night. might labour far upstream yet miss fog. fear must leave River now, make portageway best here.’ ‘That easy, even Men,’ said Boromir. ‘Yet will try it,’ said Aragorn. ‘Aye, will,’ said Gimli. ‘The legs Men will lag rough road, Dwarf goes on, burden twice weight, Master Boromir!’ task proved hard indeed, yet end done. goods taken boats brought top bank, level space. boats drawn water carried up. far less heavy expected. tree growing Elvish country made even Legolas knew; wood tough yet strangely light.

Nonetheless needed strength two Men lift haul ground Company cross. sloped away River, tumbled waste grey limestone-boulders, hidden holes shrouded weeds bushes; thickets brambles, sheer dells; boggy pools fed waters trickling terraces inland. One one Boromir Aragorn carried boats, others toiled scrambled baggage. last removed laid portage-way. little hindrance, save sprawling briars fallen stones, moved forward together.

Beyond shore rose sheer grey cliff, passage foot. Already short afternoon past, dim cloudy dusk closing in. sat beside water listening confused rush roar Rapids hidden mist; tired sleepy, hearts gloomy dying day. ‘Well, are, must pass another night,’ said Boromir. ‘We need sleep, even Aragorn mind pass Gates Argonath night, tired – except, doubt, sturdy dwarf.’ Gimli made reply: nodding sat. ‘Let us rest much now,’ said Aragorn. ‘Tomorrow must journey day again.

Already fog thinning. kept close western side, see dim shapes low cliffs rising higher, shadowy walls feet hurrying river. mid-morning clouds drew lower, began rain heavily. drew skin-covers boats prevent flooded, drifted on; little seen grey falling curtains. rain, however, last long. Slowly sky grew lighter, suddenly clouds broke, draggled fringes trailed away northward River. fogs mists gone. travellers lay wide ravine, great rocky sides clung, upon shelves narrow crevices, thrawn trees. channel grew narrower River swifter. speeding along little hope stopping turning, whatever might meet ahead. lane pale-blue sky, around dark overshadowed River, black, shutting sun, hills Emyn Muil, opening seen. Frodo peering forward saw distance two great rocks approaching: great pinnacles pillars stone seemed. Tall sheer ominous stood upon either side stream. narrow gap appeared them, River swept boats towards it. ‘Behold Argonath, Pillars Kings!’ cried Aragorn. ‘We pass soon. Keep boats line, far apart can! Hold middle stream!’ Frodo borne towards great pillars rose towers meet him. Giants seemed him, vast grey figures silent threatening. saw indeed shaped fashioned: craft power old wrought upon them, still preserved suns rains forgotten years mighty likenesses hewn. Upon great pedestals founded deep waters stood two great kings stone: still blurred eyes crannied brows frowned upon North. left hand raised palm outwards gesture warning; right hand axe; upon head crumbling helm crown. Great power majesty still wore, silent wardens long-vanished kingdom. Awe fear fell upon Frodo, cowered down, shutting eyes daring look boat drew near. Even Boromir bowed head boats whirled by, frail fleeting little leaves, enduring shadow sentinels Nu´menor. passed dark chasm Gates. Sheer rose dreadful cliffs unguessed heights either side. Far dim sky. black waters roared echoed, wind screamed them. Frodo crouching knees heard Sam front muttering groaning: ‘What place! horrible place! let boat, I’ll never wet toes puddle again, let alone river!’ ‘Fear not!’ said strange voice behind him. Frodo turned saw Strider, yet Strider; weatherworn Ranger longer there. stern sat Aragorn son Arathorn, proud erect, guiding boat skilful strokes; hood cast back, dark hair blowing wind, light eyes: king returning exile land. ‘Fear not!’ said. ‘Long desired look upon likenesses Isildur Ana´rion, sires old. shadow Elessar, Elfstone son Arathorn House Valandil Isildur’s son, heir Elendil, naught dread!’ light eyes faded, spoke himself: ‘Would Gandalf here! heart yearns Minas Anor walls city! whither go?’ chasm long dark, filled noise wind rushing water echoing stone. bent somewhat towards west first dark ahead; soon Frodo saw tall gap light him, growing. Swiftly drew near, suddenly boats shot through, wide clear light. sun, already long fallen noon, shining windy sky. pent waters spread long oval lake, pale Nen Hithoel, fenced steep grey hills whose sides clad trees, heads bare, cold-gleaming sunlight. far southern end rose three peaks. midmost stood somewhat forward others sundered them, island waters, flowing River flung pale shimmering arms.

Nonetheless night wore Aragorn grew uneasy, tossing often sleep waking. small hours got came Frodo, whose turn watch. ‘Why waking?’ asked Frodo. ‘It watch.’ ‘I know,’ answered Aragorn; ‘but shadow threat growing sleep. well draw sword.’ ‘Why?’ said Frodo. ‘Are enemies hand?’ ‘Let us see Sting may show,’ answered Aragorn. Frodo drew elf-blade sheath. dismay edges gleamed dimly night. ‘Orcs!’ said. ‘Not near, yet near, seems.’ ‘I feared much,’ said Aragorn. ‘But maybe side River. light Sting faint, may point spies Mordor roaming slopes Amon Lhaw. never heard Orcs upon Amon Hen. Yet knows may happen evil days, Minas Tirith longer holds secure passages Anduin. must go warily tomorrow.’ day came fire smoke. Low East black bars cloud fumes great burning. rising sun lit beneath flames murky red; soon climbed clear sky. summit Tol Brandir tipped gold. Frodo looked eastward gazed tall island. sides sprang sheer running water. High tall cliffs steep slopes upon trees climbed, mounting one head another; grey faces inaccessible rock, crowned great spire stone. birds circling it, sign living things seen. eaten, Aragorn called Company together. ‘The day come last,’ said: ‘the day choice long delayed. become Company travelled far fellowship? turn west Boromir go wars Gondor; turn east Fear Shadow; break fellowship go way may choose?
